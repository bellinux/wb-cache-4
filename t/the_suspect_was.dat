5|$|On 18 December 2006, Suffolk Constabulary {{reported}} that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of murdering all five women. The man was arrested at 07.20 at a house in Trimley St. Martin near Felixstowe, Suffolk. The detention of <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> extended by magistrates by a further period of 24 hours, to the maximum of 96 hours allowed under English law.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 1996, {{investigators}} {{announced that}} they would perform DNA testing on the drivers of all vehicles similar to the Mercedes. This {{was the first time}} the method was used nationally to identify a murder suspect. Detectives traced more than 1,000 vehicles and tested 5,000 drivers. On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping them with their inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police. He was subsequently identified as Stuart Morgan, a 36-year-old self-employed lorry driver, who on 21 February was remanded following an appearance at Redditch magistrates.|$|E
40|$|Most of time, <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed {{innocent}} in {{the beginning}} of the penal proceeding. But this presumption of innocence is created for saving individual freedoms and reputation. The truth <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty after his arrest. And the judicial authorities will check if <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> innocent or confirmed guilty. This situation can threaten individual freedoms and reputation. That is why we want to size the meaning of presumption of innocence in other to protect it, at first. Secondly, we are going to study the presumption of culpability. What is more, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty justifies the office of a barrister at any stage of the penal proceeding. In fact, before the arrest of <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> he <b>is</b> presumed innocent. After his arrest he is presumed guilty...|$|R

50|$|The broom test {{uses the}} laws of physics to put the accused at a {{distinct}} disadvantage. <b>The</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> seated upon a small seat which provides very little support or balance. After some ritual actions, the bristle ends of two brooms are pushed against the front of <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> neck. If <b>the</b> brooms separate, or rather if the potential witch is able to remain upright, then <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> innocent.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on Crimewatch. Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was {{believed to have been}} staying, about a mile away. Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation, and had returned to Britain from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case {{was turned over to}} the Webster County prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. <b>The</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E
40|$|We use the National Crime Victimization Survey {{to examine}} whether a suspect's {{relationship}} to an assault victim affects whether the police make an arrest. The results indicate that in cases of minor assaults the police {{are less likely to}} make an arrest when <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> an identifiable stranger. However, the police are not as lenient when <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> an intimate partner as they <b>are</b> when <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> someone else <b>the</b> victim knows. Intimate partner suspects avoid arrest in part because {{they are less likely to}} commit their crimes in front of witnesses. In addition, victims who know <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> in any way are reluctant to sign complaints, and this reluctance inhibits arrest. Men are less likely than women to sign complaints, particularly when <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> a partner. Arts, Education and LawNo Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|Thomas Duke Marshall, {{a nephew}} of Chief Justice John Marshall and former {{resident}} of Washington County, Kentucky, {{was living in}} San Felipe. He noticed that the man called John Parker bore a strong resemblance to the Desha family of Kentucky and that he breathed through a silver tube like the one used by Isaac Desha. Marshall arrested Desha. After another former Kentuckian in the area also said he believed <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> Isaac Desha, Desha admitted his identity and confessed to murdering Early. He said he had intended to rob the Americans who had traveled with him from San Antonio, but the Mexican had watched him too closely. Although there was no jail in the town, a local blacksmith was commissioned to construct irons to restrain Desha until his trial.|$|E

25|$|In {{the night}} of 15–16 December, a 26-year-old man was stopped by police and Berlusconi's bodyguards while trying {{to gain access to}} Berlusconi's {{hospital}} room.

A member of LulzSec claimed that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> not part of the group, but did host one of its IRC channels on his server. British police confirmed that he was being questioned regarding alleged involvement in LulzSec attacks against the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) and other targets. They also questioned him regarding an attack on the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry in November 2010. On 25 June 2011 the court released Cleary under the bail conditions that he not leave his house without his mother and not use any device connected to the internet.
