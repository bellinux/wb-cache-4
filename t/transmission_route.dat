25|$|Adults may be vectors of {{pathogens}} {{of diseases}} such as dysentery. Flies, most commonly Calliphoridae, have frequently been associated with disease transmission in humans and animals, as well as myiasis. Studies and research have linked Calliphora and Lucilia to vectors of causal agents of bacterial infections. These larvae, commonly seen on decaying bodies, feed on carrion while the adults can be necrophagous or vegetative. During the process of decay, microorganisms (e.g. Mycobacterium) may be released through the body. Flies arrive at the scene and lay their eggs. The larvae begin eating and breaking down the corpse, simultaneously ingesting these organisms {{which is the first}} step of one <b>transmission</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Peckford {{administration}} {{worked to}} renegotiate the lopsided Upper Churchill contract with Quebec, however repeated attempts were unsuccessful. The {{federal government was}} unwilling to intervene, and in 1984 and 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled twice in Quebec's favour. Like his predecessor, Peckford hoped to develop the Lower Churchill hydro project, but his government was also unsuccessful in securing a <b>transmission</b> <b>route</b> through Quebec. His government sought for constitutional change so that the province would have greater control of the fisheries, but Peckford was unable to get enough support from other premiers. The government did its best to influence federal fisheries policies, but Ottawa still brought in controversial policies that Peckford felt were disastrous. His government also continued with policies that added to overcapacity in the fishery, such as allowing too many fish processing plants to operate.|$|E

25|$|While the Moores {{government}} {{was successful in}} implementing democratic reforms, his government had little impact on improving Newfoundland's economy. Much {{of his time in}} power was monopolized with completing unfinished industrial projects negotiated by Smallwood, many of which were unsuccessful. The government tried to re-negotiate the sale of Upper Churchill Hydro electricity to Hydro-Quebec, but was unsuccessful. In 1974, $160 million was paid the British Newfoundland Corporation (BRINCO) to buy back water rights and obtain a controlling interest in the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited, with hopes of developing hydro power on the Lower Churchill river. However, the {{government was}} not able to negotiate a <b>transmission</b> <b>route</b> across Quebec to sell power into the North American market. The Stephenville linerboard mill was another drain on government money and resources. By the time Moores took office in 1972, the mill's projected cost had increased from $75 million to $122 million, and government guarantees had more than doubled from $53 million to $110 million. The mill was losing $100 on every ton of linerboard it produced by 1976, and needed government subsidies to stay afloat. The province closed the mill, owned by the Crown corporation Labrador Linerboard Limited, in August 1977 and sold the mill to Abitibi-Price Ltd. for $43.5 million. The Come By Chance Refinery also cost the government millions of dollars in loans, including $60 million in 1975. The refinery was $42 million in debt to the province when it filed for bankruptcy in 1976.|$|E

We found that {{a significant proportion of}} animals leave the nest with infection and that the risk of infection increases throughout the lifetime of Norway rats.

40|$|Some parasites {{move from}} one host to another via trophic transmission, the {{consumption}} of the parasite (inside its current host) by its future host. Feeding links among free-living species can thus be understood as potential <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> for parasites. As these links have different dynamic and structural properties, they may also vary in their effectiveness as trophic <b>transmission</b> <b>routes.</b> That is, some links may be better than others in allowing parasites to complete their complex life cycles. However, not all links are accessible to parasites as most are restricted to {{a small number of}} host taxa. This restriction means that differences between links involving host and non-host taxa must be considered when assessing whether <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> for parasites have different food web properties than other links. Here we use four New Zealand lake food webs to test whether link properties (contribution of a link to the predators diet, prey abundance, prey biomass, amount of biomass transferred, centrality, and asymmetry) affect trophic transmission of parasites. Critically, we do this using both models that neglect the taxonomy of free-living species and models that explicitly include information about which free-living species are members of suitable host taxa. Although the best-fit model excluding taxonomic information suggested that <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> have different properties than other feeding links, when including taxonomy, the best-fit model included only an intercept. This means that the taxonomy of free-living species is a key determinant of parasite <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> and that food-web properties of <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> are constrained by the properties of host taxa. In particular, many intermediate hosts (prey) attain high biomasses and are involved in highly central links while links connecting intermediate to definitive (predator) hosts tend to be dynamically weak.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{continue to}} cause significant financial, economic and health issues. Much {{work has been}} done on a variety of pathogens and host species {{with a wide range of}} approaches and methodologies from many disciplines, yet a full understanding of pathogen emergence has not been achieved. A greater understanding of transmission would benefit the management of control strategies, help to improve decision-making at first diagnosis of a host-pathogen interaction and possibly prevent further spread of epidemics and therefore new cases of emergence. A major gap in all these efforts appears to be a comprehensive, detailed approach for categorising pathways of transmission. Here, I develop and present a framework to categorise transmission events of pathogens. I use this framework to review the available literature on the transmission of pathogens of seven livestock species, and to derive intra- as well as inter-species <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> or pathways by which pathogens may emerge and infect the livestock hosts. A general dataset of the livestock pathogens was constructed, containing information on 141 bac- terial and viral pathogen species. One finds these pathogens exploit 7204 distinct <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> between 215 different host species. Analysis of this dataset verifies the dominance of multi- host pathogens, and suggests that non-close or indirect <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> tend to be associated with larger host range. The data shows the faecal-oral transmission mode is the predominant transmission pathway for livestock infection. To attempt to link features of species-scale <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> with emergence rates, a second dataset was constructed. This was a more detailed description of twelve Salmonella enterica serovars, and holds 1716 distinct <b>transmission</b> <b>routes,</b> llO distinct host species. One finds t. he connectedness of a host species within its network of <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> is associated to its po- tential for acquiring Salmonella infection. Analysis of both datasets highlights the substantial importance of anthropogenic mechanical vectors such as food and feedstuffs for the emergence of infectious disease in both humans and livestock animals. The developed framework demonstrably captures important aspects of pathogen emergence, al- though there are limitations in the quality and availability of information required to generate the datasets. The networks of <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> derived using this framework show common features and structural properties which may explain emergence potential. It is hoped that, by adopting this framework, the scientific community can improve the understanding of the drivers of transmission and emergence of these important pathogens.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{last three}} decades have seen a series of HIV {{interventions}} in sub-Saharan Africa. However, youths still have a mixture of correct and incorrect HIV/AIDS knowledge of <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> and prevention strategies. Previous studies have identified parents and peers {{as the most important}} socializing agents for youths. This paper assesses the relationships between family structure, family/peer communication about sexuality and accurate knowledge of <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> and prevention strategies. Methods Data were drawn from the Cameroon Family Life and Health Survey (CFHS) conducted in 2002. The CFHS collected information on a representative sample of 4 950 people aged 10 years and over nested within 1 765 selected households from the 75 localities forming the administrative prefecture of Bandjoun, using detailed questionnaires about family, HIV/AIDS/STDs knowledge, sexual behaviors, contraception, health, media exposure, household assets and neighborhood characteristics. The survey cooperation rates were high (97 %). For the purpose of this study, a sub-sample of 2 028 unmarried youths aged 12 - 29 years was utilized. Results Overall, 42 % of respondents reported accurate knowledge of documented HIV <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> whereas 21 % of them had inaccurate knowledge such as AIDS can be transmitted through mosquito bites or casual contact with an infected person. Only 9 % of respondents were knowledgeable about all HIV prevention strategies. Multivariate analyses showed that family structure, communication with parents/guardians and peers about sexual topics were significantly associated with accurate HIV knowledge. Additionally, age, education, sexual experience and migration had significant effects on accurate knowledge. Finally, living in poor households and disadvantaged neighborhoods significantly increased inaccurate knowledge of HIV transmission modes and prevention strategies. Conclusions This paper evidenced the limited effects of HIV interventions/programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, few respondents reported accurate knowledge about HIV <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> and prevention strategies. Findings showed that the role of family environment as source of accurate HIV knowledge <b>transmission</b> <b>routes</b> and prevention strategies is of paramount significance; however, families have been poorly integrated in the design and implementation of the first generation of HIV interventions. There is an urgent need that policymakers work together with families to improve the efficiency of these interventions. Peer influences is likely controversial because of the double positive effect of peer-to-peer communication on both accurate and inaccurate knowledge of HIV <b>transmission</b> <b>routes.</b> </p...|$|R
