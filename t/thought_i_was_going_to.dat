25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
500|$|Following an eleven-year hiatus {{producers}} asked Dennis {{to return}} to Neighbours for the 20th anniversary episodes. But their talks resulted in Dennis agreeing to return full-time. Alan Dale who played his on-screen father, Jim Robinson helped Dennis {{to make the decision}} to return. Dennis has since admitted that he made a mistake quitting Neighbours in 1992. He explained [...] "I was stupid. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go to Hollywood and conquer the world, and I didn't." [...] Dennis' return made Paul the only original character still appearing on Neighbours. The actor continued to publicise his commitment to staying on the show long-term.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E

500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling me to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get us killed." ...|$|E
500|$|During her {{audition}} for the show, Thorne read the {{lines from the}} Pembleton character in a previous episode. She said of her audition, [...] "I said, 'So {{what do you want}} me to do? Do you want me to be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't want to say that but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very aware of the fact that it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Arnold replied. [...] "I {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong to speak to your sister as I did. I have a great responsibility here which will occupy all my <b>thoughts.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to devote myself to work. The other things do not interest me any longer." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "No {{one ever}} faced the knife more eagerly than I. You would have <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on a {{wonderful}} cruise - which, in a way, I suppose I was," [...] Campbell {{wrote in her}} autobiography. She had already started working as a model in New York City prior to her surgery and was considered a great beauty.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} Entwistle's first solo album in six years. [...] "I had stopped writing because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{in the wrong}} {{direction}} with the 'shoo-bop, shoo-bop,' old rock & roll stuff on Rigor Mortis Sets In and Mad Dog. When I started writing again, I went back to the kind of material <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing before those albums.|$|R
500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able {{to go in there and}} get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
500|$|Wayne Pommen, the first-choice Cambridge bow, {{was injured}} {{two days before}} the race, {{fracturing}} his wrist following a full-speed collision with the harbourmaster's launch during a practice start. [...] Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head but did not require medical attention. Cambridge number seven James Livingston said: [...] "For a couple of seconds I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die. [...] We were going flat out {{and all of a sudden}} I heard Jim's voice. [...] I've never heard so much fear in anybody's voice before." [...] Pommen was circumspect: [...] "A few of us were feeling quite lucky last night... at the same time, it was very frustrating and disappointing... but there was no point sulking in the corner." [...] Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired. [...] Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith, brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew. [...] Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line-up of a crew been made. Along with James and David Livingston, this was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E

500|$|On January 31, 2010, Pink {{performed}} the song at the 52nd Grammy Awards {{in a similar}} fashion. She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced into the aisle and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. You just have to be amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. I <b>thought...</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the end of}} the debate, Mitt Romney remarked, [...] "This is a {{lot like}} 'Law & Order,' senator. It has a huge cast, the series seems to go on forever and Fred Thompson shows up at the end." [...] Romney was making a {{reference}} to Fred Thompson's role on Law & Order. Thompson replied, [...] "And to think I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the best actor on the stage." ...|$|E

Harlan Ober did travel far {{and wide}} in the {{interests}} of the Faith, but at that particular time he did not cherish making that journey. A few days later `Abdu’l-Bahá told him to go to America. “But Master,” Ober said, “I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> India.” “So did Christopher Columbus,” `Abdu’l-Bahá replied.’ ...|$|E

5000|$|On 30 March 2007, Hopoate {{experienced}} {{his first}} defeat, which {{came at the}} hands of Brian Fitzgerald. The result, a split decision after six rounds, proved controversial and inspired Hopoate to say, [...] "I'm being vilified again. It obviously {{has something to do with}} my playing days. I know I'm <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> 'John Hopoate' for the rest of my life. But I've tried to take a new road and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> along good, until this.

2500|$|Graham {{often cited}} {{the fact that}} had 10 votes swung from the Conservatives to the Liberals in the riding of Kennebecasis {{there would have been}} a 27-27 tie which may have led to a Liberal {{minority}} government supported by the New Democrats whose one member would have held the balance of power. [...] Graham was quoted on election night saying [...] "until five minutes ago, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be premier".|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, a {{woman who}} was three months {{pregnant}} went to Sowell's home voluntarily. When she tried to leave, he bound her hands and feet with a tie and belt, then gagged her with a rag. The victim told police: [...] "He choked me real hard because my body started tingling. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die." [...] Sowell was charged with kidnapping, rape and attempted rape. He eventually pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted rape, and as a result he served 15 years in prison. He was released in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|On September 3, 2007, Martínez {{returned}} from the disabled list with his 207th career win, allowing two earned runs in five efficient innings and collecting his 3000th career strikeout, becoming the 15th pitcher to do so. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have butterflies and like that", said Martínez, [...] "but I guess I'm too old." [...] Martínez's comeback was considered a great success, as the right-hander went 3–1 in five starts with a 2.57 ERA. But his last start was a crucial 3–0 loss to St. Louis in the final week of the 2007 Mets' historic collapse; Martínez provided a good pitching performance (7 IP, 2 ER, 7 H, 1 BB, 8 K) but his teammates failed to score.|$|E
60|$|This I did, {{but it was}} {{not easy}} to do. Twice I sank above my knees in mud and water, and {{had it not been for}} reeds, masses of which I {{frequently}} clutched when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> over, <b>I</b> believe I should have fallen down and come to my death in that horrible marsh. When I reached the boat, I stood up to my hips in water and saw no way of climbing up. The gang-plank had undoubtedly floated away, and if it had not, it would have been of no use to me in my position.|$|R

60|$|The wreck, even to my unpractised eye, <b>was</b> {{breaking}} up. <b>I</b> {{saw that}} she was parting in the middle, and that the life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by a thread. Still, he clung to it. He had a singular red cap on,--not like a sailor's cap, but of a finer colour; and as the few yielding planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged, and his anticipative death-knell rung, he was seen by all of us to wave it. I saw him do it now, and <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> distracted, when his action brought an old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend.|$|R
2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I {{thought they were going to}} shut us down, and I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be out of a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Foster {{graduated}} from Nordonia High School {{in the suburbs}} of Cleveland, Ohio. At his father's encouragement, Foster moved in with his uncle in Sylmar, Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in music. Foster worked various jobs and at night, he attended parties in Hollywood to expand his social network. He said, [...] "I felt like an 18-year-old Hunter S. Thompson. I was just diving into this Hollywood Hills subculture and taking it all in. I wasn't shy about taking my guitar out at a party. I wanted {{to be the center of}} attention." [...] At one time, he roomed with actor Brad Renfro. Foster struggled with drug addiction during his initial years in Los Angeles, saying, [...] "It got pretty dark. My friends <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die. I was blind to it. When I was 19 years old, it got to a point where I said, 'Enough is enough' ... I saw time was just passing me by. I wasn't being productive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{coach in the}} NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

I had just got out of jail so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> walking away from the scene. He <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> back to the car to get a gun.
