5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
5|$|Jim briefly {{transfers}} to Stamford branch after Pam confirms {{her commitment to}} Roy. Corporate is later forced to merge the Stamford branch and staff into the Scranton branch. Included in the transfer to Scranton are Karen Filippelli, with whom Jim has developed a relationship, and the anger-prone Andy Bernard. Pam is newly single after calling off her marriage and relationship to Roy prior to the merger, and Jim's unresolved feelings for her and new relationship with Karen lead to shifting tensions amongst the three. Meanwhile, Michael and Jan's relationship escalates which causes them both to behave erratically on the job while Dwight and Angela continue their secret relationship. In the season's finale, Jim, Karen, and Michael interview for a corporate position <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be Jan's, who is fired that day for poor performance. Jim wins and rejects the offer off-screen, opting instead to return to Scranton without Karen and asks Pam out on a date, which she joyfully accepts. In the final scene, we learn Ryan has been awarded Jan's job due to his business school credentials.|$|E
5|$|There is {{reliance}} on repetition of themes within {{the plot of}} Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be false, and {{this is followed by}} the death of a woman who are gone until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take away from any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E

If the reference group used to establish the reference range can be assumed to be representative of the individual person in a healthy state, then a test result from that individual <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be lower or higher than the reference range can be interpreted as that there is less than 2.5% probability that this would have occurred by random variability in the absence of disease or other condition, which, in turn, is strongly indicative for considering an underlying disease or condition as a cause.|$|E

He plans to take Weena back to his own time.

The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.|$|E

In Karachi, Steely Dan uses The Lovers to hold Joseph hostage, forcing Jotaro {{into the role of}} personal manservant. Arabia Fats, user of The Sun, attempts to thwart the group in the Arabian Desert but is discovered and easily defeated. The group is soon saddled with the baby Mannish Boy, who uses his Stand, Death 13, to attack in dreams. Only through Kakyoin's quick thinking does the group survive the baby's dreamworld; afterwards, Kakyoin punishes Mannish Boy by tricking Joseph and Polnareff into feeding the baby his own feces. On an island in the Red Sea, Polnareff is accosted by the genie Stand Judgment, but the previously assumed dead Avdol returns and saves him. Avdol appropriates a submarine, but the vehicle is infiltrated by the High Priestess, a Stand controlled by Midler that can take the form of anything metallic; however, Star Platinum's power easily defeats it.|$|E

Upon arrival at the hospital, the doctors get to work treating the people who were injured in accident.

500|$|In his psychoanalytical {{study of}} the Adventures of Tintin, the {{academic}} Jean-Marie Apostolidès characterised the Secret of the Unicorn-Red Rackham's Treasure arc as being about the characters going on a [...] "treasure hunt <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be {{at the same time}} a search for their roots." [...] He stated that the arc revolves around Haddock's ancestry, and in doing so [...] "deals with the meanings of symbolic relations within personal life". Highlighting that Calculus was one of many eccentric scientists to have appeared in the series, he nonetheless emphasises his difference by noting that Calculus approaches Tintin, rather than Tintin approaching him, as the young reporter had done with previous scientists. Commenting on the introduction of Calculus' shark submarine, he states that it [...] "allows them to cross a boundary previously restricting human beings and to penetrate into another universe, the one beneath the seas that holds secrets hitherto unknown." [...] Ultimately, he believes that by the end of the story, [...] "the family structure is in place", with Calculus representing a father figure with financial control, and Haddock and Tintin, who have become brothers through their joint adventure, adding that with the aid of Francis Haddock, [...] "the ancestor", they are given a home at Marlinspike Hall.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be ironic in a bad way, then we have to change it." ...|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{decided that}} to make [...] "time travel in an X-Files way", the best way was with [...] "a guy <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be you". He {{therefore}} added the plot about a regretful scientist trying to stop developments from ever occurring. The scientist's character {{was inspired by a}} story Gordon heard about Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer berating Harry S. Truman on the 1945 atomic bombings of Japan, and the writer wondered [...] "What if Oppenheimer could go back to the past and 'uninvent' the bomb?". Eventually Gordon and Greenwalt found another philosophical question that becomes Jason's motivation to halt his own research—"Life itself is about the unknown and discovering what is in front of us. But if everyone, or maybe some people, knew what would happen, that would create a new set of horrors, and it would need to be stopped". The script took over a week of writing, with sessions of 15 daily hours and the contributions of John Shiban, Frank Spotnitz and Ken Horton. Gordon was still reworking the teleplay the weekend before shooting began in Vancouver, including the removal of two [...] "useless characters" [...] that included a Stephen Hawking-inspired scientist in a wheelchair. David Duchovny declared that a few scenes were created during production [...] "because no one could know if the audience understood what was happening".|$|E
500|$|Jamal Khashoggi, of Al-Watan and ArabNews in Saudi Arabia, {{spoke with}} Muhammad Ali al-Shehri in Khamis Mushait, who said his sons Wail and Waleed {{had been missing}} for months. Wail al-Shehri's father denied reports that Wail had an {{aeronautics}} degree, as some news reports said, [...] "My son Wail was 25 {{years old and had}} a BA in physical education from the Abha Teacher’s College. He was mentally ill and had gone to numerous clerics for assistance in overcoming this instability. He had asked the school, where he taught, for a 6-month leave to go to Madinah." [...] His father also told reporters that he dreaded having to believe that Wail and Waleed were involved in the September 11 attacks, [...] "If <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the truth, then I'll never, never accept it from them. I'll never forgive them for that." [...] Family members said that Wail and Waleed became very religious in the months before they disappeared, had expressed interest in going to Chechnya, and hoped for martyrdom. In a report entitled [...] "A Saudi Apology" [...] for Dateline NBC aired on August 25, 2002, John Hockenberry traveled to Asir, where he interviewed Shehri's brother, Salah, who agreed that Wail and Waleed were deceased. Salah described them as not very religious, and suggested they had been brainwashed.|$|E

[...] He stated that the arc delves into Haddock's ancestry, and in doing so [...] "deals with the meanings of symbolic relations within personal life". Discussing the character of Sir Francis Haddock, he states that this ancestral figure resembles both Tintin and Haddock, [...] "the foundling and the bastard", thus making the duo brothers as well as close friends. He adds that when Captain Haddock reenacts his ancestor's fight with Rackham, he adopts his [...] "very soul, his mana, and is transformed in the process." [...] Comparing Sir Francis Haddock to Robinson Crusoe, he also draws a comparison between the way that the Caribbean natives deified Sir Francis Haddock by erecting a statue of him in the same manner that the Congolese deify Tintin at the end of Tintin in the Congo. Apostolidès also discusses Red Rackham, noting that the name [...] "Red" [...] conjures up [...] "the forbidden colour of blood and wine" [...] while [...] "Rackham" [...] combines raca ("false brother") with the French word for scum (racaille), then highlighting a potential link between Rackham's name and that of Rascar Capac, an Incan mummy who appears in The Seven Crystal Balls. He further draws parallels between the model ships containing the secret parchments with the Arumbaya fetish containing a rare diamond which appears in The Broken Ear.|$|E
