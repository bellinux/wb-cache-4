5|$|As {{the battle}} at Tithwal {{continued}} for months, <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> grew desperate {{and launched a}} massive attack on 13 October, hoping to drive the Indians from their positions.

The battalion's advance beyond Barwali was obstructed by the increasing number of roadblocks and minefields. Supporting tanks were also unable to cross the obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Planners {{believed}} the SEALs {{could get to}} Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military.

The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Rane, {{in command}} of {{a section of the}} 37th Assault Field Company, {{attached}} to the 4th Dogra Battalion, was sent forward to help clear a path for the battalion. As Rane and his team started clearing a minefield, mortar fire from <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> killed two sappers and wounded five others, including Rane. Despite this, by the evening of 8 April, Rane and his surviving men cleared the minefield which enabled the supporting tanks to move forward. A safe lane still had to be prepared for the tanks as the road ahead was still dangerous; the Pakistani forces had yet to be cleared from the area. This lane was created by Rane through the night. The next day, his section worked for twelve continuous hours to clear mines and roadblocks. As the road was still too difficult to deal with, he made a diversion for the battalion to forward. Rane continued this work despite ongoing artillery and mortar fire from <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis.</b>|$|E

Shortly after his return, Ismay served briefly on the British delegation to the United Nations to deal with the Kashmir issue. Ismay played only a limited role, as <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> suspected him of pro-Indian sympathies.|$|E

5|$|Bad weather {{prevented}} {{this action}} and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous {{position in the}} Naushahra Sector, was captured by <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{met with}} the National Security Council on March 14 to review the options. The President was {{concerned}} that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly.

5|$|On 11 July, the Indian troops {{commenced}} their attack. These strikes {{continued for}} another four days.

American officials said that the S Wing of <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> ISI provided direct support to three major groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan: the Afghan Taliban based in Quetta, Pakistan, commanded by Mullah Muhammad Omar; the militant network run by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar; and a different group run by the guerrilla leader Jalaluddin Haqqani, all considered a strategic asset by Pakistan in contrast to the TTP run by Hakimullah Mehsud, which has engaged <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> army in combat.|$|R

5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, {{and the lights}} go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|He {{launched}} three subsequent attacks‚ÄîOperations , Easy and Bison‚Äîto {{capture the}} Naushera, Jhangar, Poonch, Zoji La, Dras, and Kargil areas.

On 6 July 1948, the Army HQ issued strict instructions against conducting any major operations without its permission. Cariappa protested against this, stating that this policy would threaten Leh, Kargil, and ultimately the Kashmir Valley, which would put the country's security at stake. Though Cariappa asked for two brigades to continue offensive strikes, he was provided only one and permitted to advance to Kargil. He disobeyed orders and launched strikes in the Ladakh area allowing India to assert control over the region. Cariappa continued several operations and offensive strikes against <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> which involved high risk. Failure of any of them might have threatened the Indian forces. He was subsequently appointed to the supreme post of commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 American {{intelligence}} analyst Raelynn Hillhouse {{wrote that}} according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill ‚Äì not capture ‚Äì bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that <b>the</b> <b>Pakistanis</b> had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis.
