5|$|During {{the civil}} war and the ensuing Soviet war in Afghanistan, most of the country's {{infrastructure}} was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. <b>The</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal's rule was export and import.|$|E

This paper presents findings of a study that analyzed how scarce resources should be allocated to {{the two types of}} secondary education [...] academic and vocational. Methodology involved correlation and regression analysis of World Bank data on <b>the</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>National</b> <b>Products</b> (GNPs) of over 100 countries and of educational expenditure variables from the UNESCO Statistical Yearbook, 1982. Findings indicate that the allocation of more inputs to academic education (in the form of expenditures, teaching staff, and pupils) had a positive effect on economic development. Countries that allocated more inputs to academic education in 1980 grew more rapidly throughout the decade than those countries that allocated fewer inputs. The data show that vocational education had some structural inefficiencies. Policymakers should allocate greate...|$|R

Professor Lawrence Klein, who also won the Nobel Prize in Economics, developed the first econometric model of the U.S. economy, which combined economic theory with mathematics, providing another way to test theories and predict future economic trends.|$|E
25|$|A {{socioeconomic}} transformation {{took place}} rapidly after World War II. In the 1940s, only 31.3% of Brazil's 41.2million inhabitants resided in towns and cities; by 1991, of the country's 146.9million inhabitants 75.5% lived in cities, and Brazil had {{two of the}} world's largest metropolitan centers: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The share of the primary sector in <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> declined from 28% in 1947 to 11% in 1992. In the same 1947–92 period, the contribution of industry to GNP increased from less than 20–39%. The industrial sector produces {{a wide range of}} products for the domestic market and for export, including consumer goods, intermediate goods, and capital goods.|$|E
50|$|The new {{government}} began {{a wave of}} nationalizations of banks and large businesses.

25|$|Women in Nigeria {{have had}} various {{challenges}} {{in order to}} obtain equal education in all forms of formal education in Nigeria. Education is a basic human right and has been recognized as such since the 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. A positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in primary school and <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> and increase of life expectancy. Because of this correlation, enrollment in schools represents the largest component of the investment in human capital in any society. Rapid socio-economic development of a nation has been observed to depend on the calibre of women and their education in that country. Education bestows on women a disposition for a lifelong acquisition of knowledge, values, attitudes, competence and skills.|$|E
25|$|Biotechnology {{arose from}} the field of {{zymotechnology}} or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, brewing contributed as much to <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government. In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.|$|E

GreenLeft wants to increase spending on development aid to 0.8% of <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product.</b> It wants to open the European markets to goods from Third World countries, under conditions of fair trade. In order to ensure free and fair trade, it wants to increase and democratise international economic organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The party also favours greater international control over financial markets. GreenLeft favours European integration, but is critical about the current policies of the European Commission. It favoured the European Constitution, but after it was voted down in the 2005 referendum, GreenLeft advocated a new treaty which emphasised democracy and subsidiarity. The party is critical about the war against terrorism.

25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{trait of}} the Dutch economy {{emerging in the}} 18th century was the fiscal-financial complex. The historically large public debt, resulting from the Republic's participation in the European wars {{around the turn of}} the 18th century, was held by a small percentage of the Dutch population (there was hardly any external debt). This implied that the Dutch fiscal system now became yoked to the service of this debt in a way that served the interests of this small rentier class. No less than 70 percent of the annual revenue of the province of Holland (the main debtor) had to be dedicated to debt service. These revenues consisted mainly of regressive indirect taxes with the perverse effect that income was transferred from the poorer classes to the richer to the amount of 14 million guilders a year (approximately 7 percent of <b>the</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>National</b> <b>Product</b> at the time). This debt burden rested preponderantly on the tax payers from Holland, as the finances of the provinces were separated in the confederal system of the Republic, and this unequal debt burden militated against other provinces agreeing to fiscal reform. Fiscal reform was also opposed by the rentiers that had a vested interest in retaining their interest income, but not in paying (direct) income taxes to pay for the debt service.|$|E

[...] Republicans in Congress demanded spending cuts in the budgets for 2012 and subsequent years in return for raising the debt limit. [...] On July 19, 2011, the Republican-led House passed a bill, the Cut, Cap and Balance Act, {{by a margin of}} 234–190 which would require $111 billion in cuts in 2012 spending levels, exempting defense, Medicare, and Social Security from these cuts, and would limit subsequent federal spending to about 20% of <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> as compared to the current 24%. [...] It did not immediately increase the debt limit, but would have required Congress to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution before increasing the debt limit. [...] The bill was tabled by a vote of 51–46 in the Senate on July 22, and thus defeated. [...] An alternate plan proposed by the bipartisan Gang of Six senators and favored by the Obama administration would contain about $3.7 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, including both new revenue and large spending cuts, including in entitlement healthcare and defense, failed to gain traction.|$|E
