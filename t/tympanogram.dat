50|$|Tympanometry {{measures}} the peak pressure (TPP) and peak-compensated static admittance (Ytm) {{of the middle}} ear at the eardrum. As the stapes is ankylosed in otosclerosis, the lateral end of the ossicular chain may still be quite mobile. Therefore, otosclerosis may only slightly reduce the admittance, resulting in either a shallow <b>tympanogram</b> (type AS), or a normal <b>tympanogram</b> (type A). Otosclerosis increases in the stiffness of the middle-ear system, raising its resonant frequency. This can be quantified using multi-frequency tympanometry. Thus, a high resonant-frequency pathology such as otosclerosis can be differentiated from low resonant-frequency pathologies such as ossicular discontinuity.|$|E
40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} tympanometric values of children who attend Oporto daycare centers and further analyze any relations with host and environmental factors. Methods Cross sectional study in a randomly selected sample of 117 daycare children up-to 3 -years old from Oporto. Tympanometric measures were collected. Results Children presented in left ear (LE) a mean peak pressure (PP) of − 156. 53 daPa and a mean compliance of 0. 16 cm 3. Right ear (RE) revealed a PP of − 145. 61 daPa and a compliance of 0. 19 cm 3. Normal <b>tympanograms</b> (type A) had a lower frequency than abnormal <b>tympanograms</b> (type B and type C). There was a positive association between age and compliance (LE: p = 0. 016; RE: p = 0. 013) and between the presence of rhinorrhea and PP (LE: p = 0. 002; RE: p < 0. 05). Abnormal <b>tympanograms</b> were more frequent in Spring (RE: p = 0. 009), in younger children (LE: p = 0. 03) and in children that had rhinorrhea (LE: p = 0. 002; RE: p = 0. 044). Healthy children had a mean PP of − 125. 19 daPa and a mean compliance of 0. 21 cm 3 in LE and a mean PP of − 144. 27 daPa and a mean compliance of 0. 22 cm 3 in RE. Conclusion Tympanometric measures presented in this paper may be applicable to Oporto daycare children up-to 3 years-old.

50|$|Admittance is how {{energy is}} {{transmitted}} through the middle ear. The instrument measures the reflected sound and expresses it as an admittance or compliance, plotting the results on a chart known as a <b>tympanogram.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{more severe}} cases, {{such as those}} with {{associated}} hearing loss or high fever, audiometry, <b>tympanogram,</b> temporal bone CT and MRI {{can be used to}} assess for associated complications, such as mastoid effusion, subperiosteal abscess formation, bony destruction, venous thrombosis or meningitis.|$|E
50|$|The {{common cause}} {{of all forms of}} otitis media is {{dysfunction}} of the Eustachian tube. This is usually due to inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nasopharynx, which can be caused by a viral URTI, strep throat, or possibly by allergies. Because of the dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, the gas volume in the middle ear is trapped and parts of it are slowly absorbed by the surrounding tissues, leading to negative pressure in the middle ear. Eventually, the negative middle-ear pressure can reach a point where fluid from the surrounding tissues is sucked into the middle ear's cavity (tympanic cavity), causing a middle-ear effusion. This is seen as a progression from a Type A <b>tympanogram</b> to a Type C to a Type B <b>tympanogram.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>tympanogram</b> is {{the result}} of a test with a tympanometer. It tests the {{function}} of the middle ear and mobility of the eardrum. It can help identify conductive hearing loss due to disease of the middle ear or eardrum from other kinds of hearing loss including SNHL.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a longitudinal study}} {{of a group of}} children who had bilateral otitis media with effusion at age five and who were compared with a group of children with normal ears at that age. OME was defined as Type B <b>tympanograms</b> and features of OME by otomicroscopic examination and normal as Type A <b>tympanograms</b> in both ears again confirmed by otomicroscopy. Results are reported for hearing (ages 5, 7, 9, / /), intelligence (3, 5, 7, 9, 11), language development (3, 5, 7, 9), speech articulation (5, 7, 9), reading attainment (7, 9, 11), and behaviour problems (5, 7, 9, 11). Children with bilateral OME at age five had a moderately high degree of hearing loss at that age and continued to have a significant degree of hearing loss at subsequent ages. The degree of later hearing loss was small. When the mean IQs over the years were combined, {{there was no significant difference}} between the groups. The bilateral OME group gained significantly lower average scores in both verbal comprehension and expression. Also, the combined speech articulation and the reading test scores were significantly lower in the bilateral OME group.

30|$|The tympanic {{membrane}} {{did not show}} abnormality. A pure tone audiogram and <b>tympanograms</b> exhibited the normal range. The lesions were so small {{and they were not}} recognized in contrast enhanced CT and MRI with gadolinium administration. After 5  months of follow-up, he and his mother hoped for radical treatment to suppress recurrent purulent ear discharge. We informed them about various possible treatments, including sclerotherapy or a local flap. Since the tumor was small, we assessed the possibility of external auditory canal stenosis caused by coagulation to be low. We coagulated his lesions using a bipolar electrical scalpel under local anesthesia. This patient remains free of recurrence at 6  months post-coagulation.|$|R
50|$|If lesions are typical, non-extensive {{and with}} no {{detriment}} to hearing, investigation into the condition is rarely required. Audiometry is {{used to determine the}} extent of hearing loss, if any. Tympanometry produces <b>tympanograms</b> which can be different when tympanosclerosis is present. Computerised tomography (CT) can be used to determine if disease is present in the middle ear. Whilst hearing loss is a common symptom in many diseases of the ear, for example in otosclerosis (abnormal bone growth in the ear), the white, chalky patches on the tympanic membrane are fairly characteristic of tympanosclerosis. Cholesteatoma is similar in appearance but the whiteness is behind the tympanic membrane, rather than inside.|$|R
50|$|After an {{otoscopy}} (examination of the {{ear with}} an otoscope) {{to ensure that the}} path to the eardrum is clear and that there is no perforation, the test is performed by inserting the tympanometer probe in the ear canal. The instrument changes the pressure in the ear, generates a pure tone, and measures the eardrum responses to the sound at different pressures. This produces a series of data measuring how admittance varies with pressure, which is plotted as a <b>tympanogram.</b>|$|E

The ear canal volume indicates whether a perforation in the eardrum (tympanic membrane) may be present. The middle ear pressure indicates whether any fluid is present in the middle ear space (also called [...] "glue ear" [...] or [...] "otitis media with effusion").

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{monitor the}} natural course of otitis media with effusion. DESIGN: Prospective, {{longitudinal}} {{assessment of the}} state of the middle ear by otoscopy and tympanometry at monthly intervals from birth to 3 years. SETTING: Domiciliary visits to family homes. SUBJECTS: 95 full term infants born between August 1991 and November 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed and simulated data (Monte Carlo) for the duration of single episodes of otitis media with effusion. RESULTS: 17 of the children had unilateral or bilateral otitis media with effusion for more than half of their first three years of life. Thirty three of the 95 children had <b>tympanograms</b> suggestive of otitis media with effusion at more than a third of observations; the remaining 62 had such <b>tympanograms</b> at less than a third of observations. The data of each group were described by a first order Markov model, yielding a mean duration of unilateral effusion episodes of 5 - 6 weeks in both groups; the mean duration of bilateral effusion was 6 and 10 weeks in the low and high incidence groups, respectively. However, the main difference between the groups was the time spent between episodes of effusion: effusion free periods were, on average, three times longer in the children who experienced less otitis media with effusion. CONCLUSION: Children who are susceptible to otitis media with effusion tend to have more separate episodes of effusion rather than an increased overall duration of episodes. Such children are primarily distinguished by the likelihood with which they acquire the disease than by their ability to recover from it...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Cross sectional observational study. SETTING [...] One third of the primary schools in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS [...] 892 Children aged 6 1 / 2 to 7 1 / 2 were examined, and satisfactory <b>tympanograms</b> were obtained in 872. Results of assay of salivary cotinine concentrations were available for 770 children, and satisfactory <b>tympanograms</b> were available for 736 of these. END POINT [...] Correlation of the prevalence of middle ear underpressure and effusion with concentrations of the marker of nicotine, cotinine, in the saliva of the children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Middle ear pressure and compliance were measured in both ears by impedance tympanometry. Salivary cotinine concentrations were assayed by gas-liquid chromatography. Cotinine concentrations increased with the number of smokers in the household. Girls had higher concentrations than boys, and children living in rented housing had higher concentrations than those living in housing owned by their parents. There was a trend towards more abnormal tympanometric findings with increasing cotinine concentration, the odds ratio for a doubling of the cotinine concentration being 1. 14 (95 % confidence interval 1. 03 to 1. 27). After adjustment for the sex of the child and housing tenure the odds ratio for a doubling of the cotinine concentration was 1. 13 (1. 00 to 1. 28). CONCLUSIONS [...] The results of this study are consistent with those of case-control studies of children attending for an operation to relieve middle ear effusion. They indicate that the disease should be added to the list of recognised hazards associated with passive smoking.

40|$|Background/Aim. Eustachian tube is a {{connection}} between throat and the middle ear. Inflammatory processes and malformations of nasal cavity could lead to dysfunction of the whole upper respiratory tract, this emphasizing {{the evaluation of the}} Eustachian tube function both in surgery and in medicine in general. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the Eustachian tube passage and function by tympanometry in different types of nasal resistance. Methods. Eustachian tube passage and function was tested in 102 patients with different types of nasal pathology and nasal resistance and compared to the results of 41 healthy persons with normal values of nasal resistance included in the control group. The patients with nasal pathology were divided into three subgroups: with mechanical, inflammatory and mixed alterations. Nasal resistance was carried out with constant body plethysmography (Jaeger). The test of Eustachian tube passage and function was performed using tympanometric Toynbee-deglutition/Valsalva-deglutition test. The results of measurements were compared with those in the healthy control group and analyzed by means of parametric and nonparametric statistic tests, Pearson χ 2 test, Fisher test of exact probability and variance analysis. Results. The subgroup with inflammatory alterations had significantly higher values of pathological <b>tympanograms</b> than other subgroups and the control group (p < 0, 05). The dysfunction of the Eustachian tube was significantly more present in all subgroups than in the control group (p < 0, 05). Conclusion. Pathological form of <b>tympanograms</b> is more often present in purely inflammatory changes of nasal cavities with higher nasal resistance than in mechanical nasal obstruction. All forms of higher nasal resistance are more often accompanied with Eustachian tube dysfunction.

40|$|Introduction Tympanometry is an {{objective}} measure of middle ear function {{that has been}} {{an integral part of}} the audiological evaluation test battery, for nearly three decades. The parameters of the <b>tympanogram</b> obtained are influenced with many factors such as introduction of positive or negative air pressure, speed of recording <b>tympanogram,</b> etc. This study was aimed to explore the influence of head positioning on tympanometric findings in normal ears. Materials and Methods Thirty ears of fifteen normal hearing subjects (mean age 22. 8 years) and five ears of subjects (mean age 23 years) with high negative middle ear pressure were selected for the study. Tympanometry was done in four postures: head erect, head bent forward (chin touching the chest), head in supine and head lateralized towards one side. Results Two different results were obtained. It was interesting to note that the results significantly changed when the <b>tympanogram</b> was recorded after ten minutes in different head positions compared to those taken immediately after changing the head position. Discussion The possible explanation for the effect of duration in different head positions on <b>tympanogram</b> is discussed. Conclusion No significant changes were observed on static compliance, middle ear pressure, ear canal volume and pressure gradient when the <b>tympanogram</b> were recorded immediately bringing head in the particular posture. When head was held in the changed position for ten minutes, significant reduction in the pressure gradient was observed.

40|$|Background Acute {{otitis media}} (AOM) {{is a common}} disease in {{children}} and is causing great discomfort and disability worldwide but many areas are underserved regarding skilled professional. Tele-otology offers a promising technique to provide ear health globally. Diagnostic accuracy of AOM has regardless of method {{been found to be}} low. Grading the severity of AOM my offer a guide in decision on antibiotic treatment, however grading systems need improvement. Aim To describe and evaluate imaging of the tympanic membrane (TM), develop an image based grading scale for AOM and to study the characteristics and the course of acute otitis media (AOM) episodes in children with the use of telemedicine techniques. Method This thesis is based on two study populations, 63 children attending with othalgia at four primary health care centers in rural Sweden (papers I, II, IV) and 140 children attending a health clinic from a township in Johannesburg, South Africa, (paper III). Paper I: Image quality of endoscopic imaging of TM´s, from the Swedish study was assessed by an otologist and two general practitioners together with an evaluation of important characteristics of assessing TM appearance. Paper II: In development and validation of an image-based grading scale of AOM two expert panels of otologist’s evaluated the proposed grading scale stepwise and in a test and retest validation process. Paper III: A test of the scale in a clinical situation was set up, an otologist oto-microscopically examined children and used the grading scale, and his diagnoses were set as gold standard. A specially trained ear and hearing facilitator then recorded videos of the TM using video-otoscopy. Videos were remotely assessed by the same otologist and by a general practitioner twice; 4 and 8 weeks after the otologist’s on-site grading. Paper IV: Children with othalgia were followed with assessments of their symptoms and signs over a period of 3 months. An assessment group of two general practitioners and one otologist evaluated TM images, <b>tympanograms</b> and recorded symptoms and make a diagnose. Results The results from paper I show that image quality was good and the position and transparency of the TM was found {{to be the most important}} characteristics when assessing TM. In paper II the new grading scale (OMGRADE) was developed and validated. The image-based scale focuses on the position and transparency of the TM. The results from paper III showed that the OMGRADE scale could discriminate the normal ear as well as ears with otitis media with effusion (OME) in an unselected pediatric population. Paper IV showed that the bilateral AOM had more severe symptoms. The children with chagrinated TM’s took the longest time to resolve regarding TM appearance and <b>tympanograms.</b> Furthermore, symptoms resolved quicker than TM changes and <b>tympanograms</b> during the first week. Conclusions TM images or video recordings taken by a trained nurse or facilitator are sufficient for remote evaluation. The new grading scale of TM appearance is valid and reliable and may function as a diagnostic guide together with evaluation of middle ear effusion. TM appearance may be of importance in grading the severity of an AOM episode. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy (CSMT) in {{the resolution of the}} persistent or chronic middle ear effusion that is associated with otitis media. This treatment was compared to the insertion of tympanostomy tubes with regards to parent perception and satisfaction. Methods: Thirty patients under the age of seven that were diagnosed as having persistent or chronic middle ear effusion were assigned to receive either tympanostomy tubes or chiropractic treatment according to parental choice. Results: After chiropractic treatment, an objective improvement in the middle ear status was noted by serial tympanography, demonstrating resolution of middle ear effusion. This was noted in 64. 3 % in the right ear, where a type B <b>tympanogram</b> improved to a type A or type C <b>tympanogram,</b> and in 58. 3 % in the left ear, where a type B improved to a type A or C <b>tympanogram,</b> or a type C improved to a type A <b>tympanogram.</b> After chiropractic treatment, subjective improvements were noted in the patient’s health, hearing, speech and language, behaviour and social skills, balance, gross and fine motor skills, otalgia and the amount of disturbed nights. Additional benefits from chiropractic treatment were noted in 93. 3 % of cases. Conclusions: The manner in which the middle ear effusion was resolved by chiropractic manipulation is by normalising the function of the eustachian tube. Eustachian tube dysfunction is a commonly reported aetiological factor in the development of otitis media with effusion, yet previously there was no treatment type to address this problem. Improvement of middle ear effusion occurred in 58. 3 - 64. 3 % of cases, indicating that chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy could be a viable treatment option to correct the eustachian tube dysfunction.

DPOAEs were lower at 6 kHz and 8 kHz in children with moderate/severe OSAHS than normal children (P < 0. 05). ConclusionCochlear function was affected when AHI was at or greater than 10 /hour. ABR and DPOAE {{can be used to}} detect early changes in auditory function in children with OSAHS...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAudiological {{evaluation}} in infants {{should include the}} middle ear (immitance measures and otoscopy) and also a cochlear evaluation. Aim: To check which tympanometry tone test (226 Hz or 1000 Hz), transient otoacoustic emissions and otoscopy. Methods: Transient otoacoustic emissions were taken from sixty infants ranging from zero to four months of age. The babies were assigned to two groups of 30 infants each, {{according to the presence}} or absence of otoacoustic emissions (OAE). All babies have undergone tympanometry with probe tones of 226 and 1000 Hz and ENT evaluation. Results: Tests performed with 1000 Hz probe tone were more sensitive in identifying middle ear disorders. In children with normal <b>tympanograms,</b> both probe tones (226 and 1000 Hz) showed high specificity. All correlations were significant when the 1000 Hz probe tone was used. Conclusion: The high frequency probe tone (1000 Hz) presented the most significant correlation with OAE and otoscopy in infants from zero to four months of age...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an {{autoimmune disease}} that causes inflammation and {{swelling of the}} joints. Middle ear joints {{may be subject to}} rheumatic involvement similar to other joints in the body. Results from previous studies examining audiological characteristics in individuals with RA have varied with respect to incidence and type of hearing loss, as well as incidence and type of middle ear involvement (increased or decreased stiffness). The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare audiometric, immittance, distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), and energy reflectance (ER) results between participants with RA and normal control (NC) participants to further examine the effects of RA on middle ear function. Twenty-one participants with RA (38 ears) were matched 1 : 1 based on age and gender to 21 individuals (38 ears) without RA. The following measures were completed for all participants: pure-tone air- and bone-conduction thresholds, 226 -, 678 - and 1000 -Hz <b>tympanograms,</b> acoustic reflex thresholds, acoustic reflex decay, and middle ear resonant frequency. ER and DPOAEs were measured for a subset of 16 RA (28 ears) and 16 NC (28 ears) matched participants. No significant difference in prevalence of hearing loss was found between groups. Individuals with hearing loss in both groups presented with sensorineural-type hearing loss, which was typically a mild to moderate high-frequency hearing loss. No significant differences were found between groups for air- and bone-conduction thresholds. A significantly greater number of ears from the RA group had thresholds poorer than the 95 th percentile for their age range and gender across the audiometric test frequencies. Generally, younger individuals with RA had poorer thresholds at 1000 and 2000 Hz compared to normative data for age and gender. No differences were found between groups for static admittance, the number of notched versus single-peaked 678 - and 1000 -Hz <b>tympanograms,</b> acoustic reflex thresholds, ER, and DPOAE measurements. The RA group had a significantly lower mean resonant frequency, consistent with an increase in the laxity or an increase in the mass dominance of the middle ear system. These significant findings revealed the importance of considering audiological assessment of individuals with RA...|$|R
