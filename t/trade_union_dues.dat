50|$|In Canadian labour law, the Rand formula (also {{referred}} to as automatic check-off) is a workplace situation where the payment of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> is mandatory regardless of the worker's union status. This formula is designed {{to ensure that no}} employee will opt out of the union simply to avoid dues yet reap the benefits of collective bargaining, such as higher wages or health insurance. Supreme Court of Canada Justice Ivan Rand, the eponym of this law, introduced this formula in 1946 as an arbitration decision ending the Ford Strike of 1945 in Windsor, Ontario. The Canada Labour Code and the labour relations laws of a majority of provinces contain provisions requiring the Rand formula when certain conditions are met. In those provinces where the labour relations laws do not make the Rand formula mandatory, the automatic check-off of union dues may become part of the collective bargaining agreement if both parties (i.e., the employer and the trade union) agree. If there are religious objections to paying dues the dues may be donated to a mutually agreed upon charity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There is {{a growing}} {{perception}} within South Africa’s mineral exploration industry that mineworkers have lost trust in <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> <b>due</b> to their absence of engagement pertaining to representation and bargaining council. Despite union membership in the mining sector gradually declining from 421 000 to 301 000 over the past 10 years, <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> have an ability to stimulate mineworkers and impact on daily operational performance. The principle {{aim of this study}} was to establish whether there is a trust deficit amongst mineworkers and <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> representatives, and how this impacts on labour and organizational performance. This study was quantitative and descriptive. A valid research instrument was used to collect data.

40|$|Nigerian {{women had}} {{been active in the}} {{socio-economic}} development of their various societies long before colonisation. Their activities situated primarily within their families and communities. Things have however changed in favour of women participation in wage employment and by extension, in <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> activities. This is because membership of the labour force makes one automatic member of the respective organisation’s <b>trade</b> <b>union.</b> Being an organisation with patriarchal structures and attitudes, this paper examines the involvement of women in the decision making processes of <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in Nigeria. A total of six hundred and forty (640) women in wage employment were chosen for this study through a multi-stage random sampling technique across five industrial unions in the country. Data were generated using the qualitative method wherein copies of a questionnaire were administered on the respondents. This was complemented by in-depth interview sessions with fifteen other female workers. Relevant literatures were reviewed and the study is situated in the pluralist perspective. Findings revealed that while women now play active roles in <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> activities, they are less involved in the decision making processes of their respective <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> <b>due</b> to inhibiting cultural attitudes and structures. Ameliorative steps that could enhance women greater involvement in the policy-making processes of these <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> are put forward...|$|R

40|$|The {{representation}} of the unemployed has been historically a problem difficult to face for <b>trade</b> <b>unions.</b> <b>Due</b> to a heavy decline of {{the ability of the}} unions to represent the increasingly complex world of work, the situation for the {{representation of}} unemployed and precarious workers has worsened in the last 30 years.

There have been in various historical moments and in various countries spontaneous forms of representation with different types of relations with the national unions.

30|$|In other cases, {{and despite}} a formal rhetoric of inclusiveness, exclusionary union attitudes are {{justified}} by concerns about a ‘race to the bottom’. Some West European <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> for instance, actively opposed the {{free movement of}} labour within the EU and lobbied for transitional arrangements after the 2004 enlargement. Speaking about Germany and Austria, Krings (2009 : 56) states, ‘Unions in both countries stressed that {{their opposition to the}} free movement of labour should not be viewed as “anti-immigration”, but that their main concern was the preservation of labour standards’. Other scholars underline the risk of conflicts between eastern and western <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> <b>due</b> to their diverging interests during the accession process (Meardi, 2002; Galgóczi et al., 2009). These examples show that, despite formal declarations of international solidarity, trade unions’ dominant frame of reference remains the national arena. Their stances on immigration often cite concern to protect the national labour market from social dumping (Cremers, 2011; Meardi, 2012; for a perspective from the sending countries, see Woolfson, 2007). These stances are strikingly similar to those reported in the earlier Penninx and Roosblad study. This leads us to conclude that the first dilemma is still valid, though it should be applied in a broader sense.|$|R

40|$|The {{decline in}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> {{membership}} {{in many countries}} since the 1970 s and the consequent weakening of the <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> is <b>due</b> {{to a number of}} reasons, including occupational changes, welfare state and social regulation, liberalism and individualization, and in Denmark (and Sweden and Finland) changes in unemployment insurance legislation and the institutional settings of the unemployment insurance system.

This article sums up all these facts and reasons for <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> decline in Denmark, but the main analysis focuses on a supplementary reason for membership decline among LO (the Danish Confederation of <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions)</b> -affiliated unions: many <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members leave their unions to become members of unions that organize managers.

40|$|From the Introduction]. This paper {{argues that}} the {{perceived}} costs, benefits and opportunities of deeper European integration will vary across <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> organisations <b>due</b> to sectoral orientation. In addition, a positive assessment of ‘Europe’ and further integration does not necessarily result in Europeanisation of any kind. A particular trade union’s response to the EU is also subject to internal ideological and organisational constraints [Marks & McAdam 1996]. By analysing responses of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> organisations to instances of EU integration this study hopes to highlight: How union organisations assess deepening European integration and the developing European political economy; The role of industrial location or sectoral orientation {{in the assessment of}} perceived economic and political interests; The role of internal organisational dynamics/constraints in determining the direction and extent of responses...|$|R
40|$|Codes {{of conduct}} {{are the main}} tools to privately {{regulate}} worker rights in global value chains. Scholars have shown that while codes may improve outcome standards (such as occupational health and safety), they have had limited impact on process rights (such as freedom of association and collective bargaining). Scholars have, though, only provided vague or general explanations for this empirical finding. We address this shortcoming by providing a holistic and detailed explanation, and argue that codes, in their current form, have limited impact on <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> rights <b>due</b> to (i) buyers paying lip service to <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> rights, (ii) workers being treated as passive objects of regulation in codes of conduct, (iii) auditing being unable to detect and remediate violations of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> rights, (iv) codes emphasizing parallel means of organizing, (v) suppliers having limited incentives for compliance, and (vi) codes being unable to open up space for union organizing when leveraged in grassroots struggles. Our arguments {{suggest that there is}} no quick fix for codes’ limited impact on <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> rights, and that codes, in their current form, have limited potential to improve <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> rights. We conclude by discussing ways in which codes of conduct, and private regulation of worker rights more generally, could be transformed to more effectively address <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> rights...|$|R
30|$|Migrants {{have also}} become a much more {{complicated}} entity for <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> particularly <b>due</b> to greater variation in their legal, labour market, and social statuses, resulting {{in a process of}} ‘civic stratification’ (Lockwood, 1996). Furthermore, anti-immigrant and populist political discourse and the inadequacy of administrative facilities often leave migrants in vulnerable positions. <b>Trade</b> <b>unions</b> may thus be called upon to face a complex of problems, well beyond labour claims and labour equality to also, increasingly, involve social and legal status. This is especially true for the significant share of migrants who are irregular and undocumented. Most activities related to vulnerable and undocumented workers, in fact, necessarily involve aspects not strictly labour-associated. Examples are assistance in regularization of residence and labour and gaining access to housing and public services. Beyond exerting political pressure on government, <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in Spain and Italy have provided direct support, setting up structures and front offices for migrant worker assistance (see Martínez-Lucio et al., 2013; Marino, 2012). In France, <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> have called attention to the legal and social conditions of immigrants, using strikes to influence government decisions on legalization of residence and work status.|$|R
40|$|The laws {{regulating}} the conduct and organisation of ballots for industrial action, developed by consecutive Conservative {{regimes in the}} <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> Act 1984, the Employment Act 1988 and the <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 – provisions now contained in the <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (TULR(C) A 1992) – have long been an issue of concern for <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> <b>due</b> to their detailed and complex nature. Although some limited amendments to the law {{were made in the}} Employment Relations Acts of 1999 and 2004 it is still the case that unions need to take considerable care in preparing the content of the ballot paper, the literature that accompanies it and in adhering to the correct procedure during the process of balloting and after the ballot has been completed. A failure to follow the detail of the provisions has often resulted in an injunction being granted to stop strike action, although on occasion courts have accepted that the interpretation of the legislation must be tempered with a dose of reality. A series of recent cases, discussed below, arguably indicate a movement towards a more restrictive application and interpretation of the statutory rules and demonstrates that the Labour Government amendments in the Employment Relations Act 1999 and Employment Relations Act 2004 2 have not sufficiently clarified or simplified the law on the procedure a union has to follow, prior to calling industrial action, in order to attract legal immunity from tort action. It is still the case that the detailed technical nature of strike ballot rules provide opportunities for employers to challenge the legality of industrial action, with the judiciary adjudicating on whether the union has complied with all the intricacies of the strike ballot regulations. A feature of this more recent case law has also been judicial consideration of whether the restrictive nature of the balloting provisions limit legitimate industrial action {{to such an extent that}} they contravene international labour law codes on the right to take strike action, and particularly, whether they constitute a breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights...|$|R
