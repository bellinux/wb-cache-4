Each game features a different array of characters and songs, and also includes an original video animation episode produced by A-1 Pictures and directed by Atsushi Nishigori. The games' story centers on the 765 Production's participation in a music festival, and is told via the anime episodes and occasional dialogue included in the games.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

25|$|The {{most celebrated}} of these dances is the karakattam. In its {{religious}} form, the dance is performed {{in front of}} an image of the goddess Mariamman. The dancer bears on his or her head a brass pot filled with uncooked rice, decorated with flowers and surrounded by a bamboo frame, and tumbles and leaps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> a song without spilling a grain. Karakattam is usually performed to a special type of song known as temmanguppāṭṭu a folk song in the mode of a lover speaking to his beloved, to the accompaniment of a nadaswaram and melam.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, Chachachá {{music had}} a close {{relationship}} with the dancer's steps. The well-known name Chachachá came into being {{with the help of the}} dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. It was like an onomatopoeia that sounded as: Chachachá. From this peculiar sound, a music genre was born which motivated people from around the world to dance at its catchy rhythm.|$|E

25|$|In time, a {{significant}} number of Ursari joined circuses, while many others began manufacturing and trading bone objects and leather (as, respectively, Pieptănari and Ciurari), or associating with the Lăutari. The bears were taught to make dancing moves to a tambourine, or trained to walk upright and perform tricks such as leaning on canes and rolling over. The use of iron rods and nose rings in the taming process, as well as other such practices, rose attention from animal welfare advocates, and {{have been the subject of}} criticism from as early as the 1920s, when Germany forbade the Ursari's trade. It has been reported that bear training involved burning the paws of cubs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> music.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat of}} the green heron is small {{wetlands}} in low-lying areas. The species is most conspicuous during dusk and dawn, and if anything these birds are nocturnal rather than diurnal, preferring to retreat to sheltered areas in daytime. They feed actively during the day, however, if hungry or provisioning young. Shore-living individuals adapt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the tides. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic arthropods, but may take any invertebrate or vertebrate prey they can catch, including such animals like leeches and mice. Green herons are intolerant of other birds – including conspecifics – when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. Sometimes they drop food, insects, or other small objects on the water's surface to attract fish, making them {{one of the few}} known tool-using species. This feeding method has led some to title the green and closely related striated heron as among the world's most intelligent birds. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey.|$|E
500|$|Musical styles {{from abroad}} have been merged with {{pre-existing}} Malagasy musical traditions to create distinctly Malagasy sounds with foreign roots. [...] An {{example of this}} is the Afindrafindrao, a tune based on the French quadrille that was popularized in the Malagasy court in the 19th century. [...] A specific form of partner dance accompanies this piece, in which dancers will form a long chain of male-female pairs with the woman at the front of each pair, both facing forward holding each other's hands while advancing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the music. [...] From its origins as a courtly dance, the afindrafindrao today is a quintessentially Malagasy tradition performed {{at the beginning of a}} social event or concert to kick off the festivities.|$|E

500|$|No Doubt {{experiments}} with several new styles on the album. [...] "Ex-Girlfriend", which originally featured a Prince-style funk sound, was rewritten and includes rapped vocals over piano and flamenco guitar parts. After opening with Gabrial McNair's jazz funeral horn part over Young's beatboxing, [...] "Bathwater" [...] proceeds into a song written in swing time. It {{was described as}} a combination of the band's 2 Tone roots with the operatic slapstick of Gilbert and Sullivan. [...] "Marry Me" [...] features use of the tabla, a pair of tuned hand drums prominent in India. Young and bassist Tony Kanal's contributions were compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> nu metal music, and the fragmented progression of [...] "Comforting Lie" [...] was likened to the work of Korn.|$|E
500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, {{the widow}} {{who runs the}} carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. [...] But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> Billy's spiel. [...] And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with {{the excitement of the}} crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well. [...] They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.|$|E
50|$|The scandal which erupted over Baker's dancing {{gave way}} to enthusiasm and quickly {{generated}} excitement among Parisians for jazz and black music.

500|$|During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to {{deal with}} their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a {{different}} project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles [...] "Counting Bodies Like Sheep <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the War Drums"—a song inspired by [...] "Pet" [...] that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and [...] "Passive". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he [...] "tested the waters" [...] and was subsequently [...] "crucified" [...] for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} Hard Candy, Chris Williams from Entertainment Weekly complemented the song, {{saying that}} with [...] "tunes like 'Give It 2 Me' [...] unabashedly reviving the celebrative spirit of early singles like 'Lucky Star' and 'Holiday' filtering it through hip-hop's sonic boom." [...] He also {{called it the}} most exciting club banger. Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe said that the song [...] "thumps relentlessly, euphorically, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> a clanking virtual cowbell and freaky bass." [...] Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle complimented the [...] "furious house grooves and thundering beats" [...] of the song. [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was compared by Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice, to the earlier Madonna song [...] "Material Girl", and the music of producer Nile Rodgers. Pete Paphides of The Times noted how different Madonna sounded in songs like [...] "Give It 2 Me", [...] "Dance 2Night" [...] and [...] "She's Not Me" [...] from the Hard Candy album. The song received negative feedback from Thomas Hauner of PopMatters, who said that [...] " [...] West-African inspired percussion bridge — airdropped onto the album and randomly landing at this point — completely disrupts the song’s full potential." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band and}} Andrés Calamaro {{recorded}} two tracks: [...] "La Mesa del Rincón" [...] and [...] "Quiero Volar Contigo", the former <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> tango (with three violins and a cello), {{and for the}} latter, Calamaro played marimba and changed the original rhythm of the song to cha-cha-cha. This performance had to be re-taped since there was a technical failure. Zack de la Rocha performed [...] "Somos Más Americanos", while Juanes played guitar on [...] "La Jaula de Oro", a song he had to [...] "rehearse many times". De la Rocha recorded his part twice, incorporating more Spanish lyrics on the second take. Juanes and De la Rocha were the only featured performers selected for their work for immigration rights in the United States, a social cause important to the band. The final song recorded was [...] "América"; the band shared the stage with Calle 13 who, by request of their lead member René Pérez, changed the instrumentation, quickened the tempo and added trumpets and violins. The costumes the band wore on the show were donated to the Hard Rock Cafe in Los Angeles after the show.|$|E

500|$|The Mari Lwyd {{party would}} {{approach}} {{a house and}} sing a song in which they requested admittance. The inhabitants of the house would then offer excuses for why the team could not enter. The party would sing a second verse, and the debate {{between the two sides}} [...] known as the pwnco [...] would continue until the house's inhabitants ran out of ideas, at which time they were obliged to allow the party entry and to provide them with ale and food. An account from Nantgarw described such a performance, in which the Punch and Judy characters would cause a noise, with Punch tapping the ground <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the music and rapping on the door with a poker, while Judy brushed the ground, house walls, and windows with a broom. The householders had to make Punch promise that he would not touch their fireplace before he entered the building, otherwise it was the local custom that before he left he would rake out the fire with his poker. In the case from Llangynwyd, however, there was no interplay between the householders and troupe, but rather the latter were typically granted entry automatically after singing the first verse of their song.|$|E
500|$|Duckles's {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} transition from the lute song, representing an older style of composition appropriate to the waning of Renaissance music, to the continuo song, reflecting newer Baroque music practice. It's not always an easy form of composition to assess: lutes were not always used for songs, and sometimes were used even after ascendancy of the continuo song. General characteristics of the lute song are smooth, flowing, and restrained lines, while the continuo song is more vigorous, abrupt and discontinuous. The harmonies in lute songs are an outgrowth of their melodic lines, while in continuo songs they define the structure. Lute songs tend to be loose and melismatic with frequent repetitions of verse fragments, while continuo songs are more closely tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> the text. Dissonance and chromaticism are used sparingly in lute songs while continuo songs show increasing use of chromaticism for more dramatic rather than pictorial underscoring. Generally, English composers were more concerned with capturing verbal rhythms than producing dramatic effects.(Hughes noted that Restoration lyrics typified Baroque figures of speech in their use of florid lyrics.) [...] Use of these techniques in England indicate their adoption from Italy, where they were first used. Previously, it had been thought that English composers either didn't know about them, or weren't interested. [...] But a comparison of Drexel 4257 with another of Gamble's books in the British Library, Additional 11608, where some of the songs appear in an embellished form, indicate that British composers and singers did occasionally [...] adopt a more florid style.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{handing out}} candy bars during his lectures is a {{reference}} to the third season episode, [...] "Business School", where Michael passed out chocolate bars during his speech to a business school classroom. Michael expresses regret for insulting Tony Gardner, the heavyset man who briefly transferred from the Stamford branch of Dunder Mifflin to the Scranton branch, who Michael drives to quit by trying to lift onto a table for an orientation demonstration in the third season episode, [...] "The Merger". Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua, New Hampshire, where Holly works, and Utica, New York, where Karen works. Michael said he can only prepare for his lectures by listening to [...] "silence or Sam Kinison", an American stand-up comedian known for his extreme and vulgar sense of humor. Michael said he learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the lyrical oath of loyalty to the United States flag, by setting the lyrics <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhythm</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Old McDonald Had a Farm", a children's song about the various animals on a farm. During one lecture, Michael and Pam both do impressions of the protagonist from Forrest Gump, the 1994 film starring Tom Hanks as a mentally handicapped man. Michael also uses the title from the films Good Morning, Vietnam (at his Nashua lecture by saying [...] "Good morning, Vietna...shua!") The Princess Bride, Gone with the Wind and Jerry Maguire in his lectures. Holly's computer has a screensaver with images of Ed Grimley, the nerdy character with a cowlick played by comedian Martin Short in the comedy shows SCTV and Saturday Night Live.|$|E
