5|$|DuMont {{survived the}} early 1950s {{only because of}} WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone {{commercial}} VHF station {{in what was then}} the sixth-largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Wheeling, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other <b>three</b> <b>networks,</b> DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} Big Three television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All <b>three</b> <b>networks</b> erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have a}} camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and by staying on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E

There are different characteristics of social capital among <b>three</b> <b>network</b> types: MNCs, strategic alliances and industrial clusters. Based on comparing dimension of social capital among <b>three</b> <b>network</b> types, we links structural, cognitive, and relational dimensions for the <b>three</b> <b>network</b> types with knowledge transfer between network members. At last, using a social capital framework, this paper compares the conditions that promoting knowledge transfer for the different network types.

In this paper, we analyze {{the performance of}} an alternative implementation approach—receiver-initiated message passing—that eliminates one of the <b>three</b> <b>network</b> latencies. Performance measurements taken on the Cell Broadband Engine indicate that receiver-initiated message passing exhibits substantially lower latency than standard, sender-initiated message passing...|$|R
25|$|In Spain, {{the final}} {{attracted}} 15.6million total Spanish viewers across <b>three</b> <b>networks,</b> which represents 86% {{share of the}} audience, becoming the highest rated TV broadcast in Spanish history.

25|$|In , the New York Yankees, {{which in}} the year prior played 21 Games of the Week for CBS (which had {{actually}} just purchased the Yankees), joined NBC's television package.

25|$|This multi-network {{capability}} {{was first}} demonstrated live on August 1, 1966, following the UT Tower sniper incident. After Charles Whitman's sniper rampage had been stopped, the primary newsman on the scene, Neal Spelce, presented a wrap-up {{of the event}} that was carried on all <b>three</b> <b>networks</b> live later that evening. Although the connections were later replaced by satellite uplink technology, the lines were maintained for contingency usage for several years.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1982 {{television}} contract signed by the NFL with the <b>three</b> <b>networks,</b> this game was the first Super Bowl to be televised in the United States by ABC, as they earned their first turn at the Super Bowl, with a new alternation process started for the 1983 game. Previously, the Super Bowl telecast alternated between CBS and NBC, while the networks simulcast the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game.|$|E
25|$|From 1950 to 1966, {{the game}} show was {{broadcast}} in black-and-white, as {{was typical of}} most game shows at the time. But by 1966, all <b>three</b> <b>networks</b> were broadcasting their prime-time schedules entirely in color, including What's My Line? After the show ended in 1967, CBS replaced the color videotapes with the kinescope versions instead for syndication. As {{a result of this}} change, the 1966–1967 episodes of What's My Line? were only shown in black-and-white after the show ended.|$|E

The event also reached record highs in several demographic categories.

25|$|The ciliary nerves run {{under the}} {{endothelium}} and exit the eye through {{holes in the}} sclera apart from the optic nerve (which transmits only optic signals). The nerves enter the cornea via three levels; scleral, episcleral and conjunctival. Most of the bundles give rise by subdivision to a network in the stroma, from which fibres supply the different regions. The <b>three</b> <b>networks</b> are, midstromal, subepithelial/sub-basal, and epithelial. The receptive fields of each nerve ending are very large, and may overlap.|$|E
25|$|After an ineffectual {{attempt to}} have Trotsky murdered, in March 1939, Stalin {{assigned}} the overall organisation of implementing the task to the NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov {{who in turn}} co-opted Nahum Eitingon. According to Sudoplatov's Special Tasks, the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks {{to carry out the}} murder, one of which relied on Ramón Mercader. According to Sudoplatov, all of the <b>three</b> <b>networks</b> were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD's hitherto established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to its}} antenna location, its signal {{could be}} {{received}} fairly well in the nearby areas of Monterey and Salinas. Taking advantage of this, KNTV sought and was granted the ABC affiliation for the Monterey Bay area in 1960, {{on the condition that}} the station reduced its transmitter power so as not to overlap with network-owned KGO-TV's signal. Previously, all <b>three</b> <b>networks</b> had been shoehorned onto Salinas-based KSBW-TV (channel 8). KNTV, therefore, became one of the few stations located outside the market it served.|$|E

In the Philippines, Kantar ratings estimated that the fight was watched across the three-network consortium by 46.9% of Filipino households; of the <b>three</b> <b>networks</b> simulcasting the fight, ABS-CBN had {{the largest number of}} viewers, with a rating share of 24%.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, ABC {{completed}} its transition to color; the decade {{as a whole}} would mark {{a turning point for}} ABC, as it began to pass CBS and NBC in the ratings to become the first place network. It also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine what types of sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences. ABC's gains in audience share were greatly helped by the fact that several smaller markets had grown large enough to allow full-time affiliations from all <b>three</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|E
