The team played Liverpool at Anfield in {{the final game of}} the season and needed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> two clear goals to be crowned champions. Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1–0, and Michael Thomas's goal with seconds left of the match ensured the team won the league title. Liverpool, days before the league encounter with Arsenal, defeated Everton to win the 1989 FA Cup Final which meant they obtained the other Charity Shield place.|$|E

Chu claimed that he {{made the decision to}} wager for a tie not out of kindness but because of the advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> a dollar. Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma State's 0–4start to conference play, {{they led}} Texas the entire first half, {{including}} a lead {{of as much}} as nineteenpoints. It was the thirdstraight year that Texas trailed Oklahoma State at halftime and came from behind <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> a sizable margin (47–28). Vince Young set a school record for total yards in one game with 506yards (239passing, 267rushing). Young also became one of only sevenplayers in NCAA history to have accumulated over 200yards rushing and 200yards passing in a singlegame.

5|$|Due to his weak {{performances}} in the opening matches, Harvey was omitted for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team and went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> an innings. The omission signified that Harvey was on the outer with regards to Test selection.|$|E
5|$|England faced {{a target}} of 596, which would have {{required}} a world record Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Light {{began his}} three-year-old season {{with his first}} Group race win in the Sandown Classic Trial. Ridden by Daryll Holland, he took the lead a furlong out and was eased in the closing stages <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> a short head. Speculation that he might develop into a Derby {{contender}} ended in his next race, when he was stepped up to {{one and a half}} miles {{for the first time and}} finished fourth of the five runners in the Lingfield Derby Trial.|$|E

The Undertaker quickly {{took control of}} the match, attacking Gonzalez with a flying clothesline <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> pinfall. After the match, Gonzalez turned on Wippleman and attacked him with a chokeslam.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} {{in the next}} fixture against Hampshire and made one as Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195. It {{was the first time}} the tourists had conceded a first innings lead on the tour. However, Harvey did not get another chance with the bat as Australia recovered <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat {{would be allowed to}} set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.|$|E
50|$|Three {{months later}} in his sole 2001 outing, González dropped a {{stunning}} 10-round split decision to lightly regarded Manuel Gomez in Las Vegas.

5|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the race, Secretariat was seen as the {{favorite}} <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby. In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby, aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, against Leicestershire, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, {{promoting}} Keith Miller ahead of himself to No. 3. As Miller {{came out to}} bat, the large crowd mobbed the players' entrance only to see that Bradman was not batting in his customary position. Bradman came to the crease at 2/157, and after initially being troubled by the left-arm unorthodox spin of Australian expatriate Jack Walsh, added 159 with Miller before falling for 81. Australia compiled 448 and bowled out the home side for 130 and 147 <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> an innings, with Bradman taking one catch.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{played in}} Australia's only match before the Fourth Test, which was against Middlesex.

In the second innings, he took two early wicketincluding Comptonto reduce the hosts to 3/27 before ending with 2/28 as Australia bowled Middlesex out for 135. Bradman’s men went on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> ten wickets.|$|E

5|$|Operation Banner {{ended at}} midnight on 31 July 2007 after about 38 years of {{continuous}} deployment, the longest in British Army history. According {{to an internal}} document released in 2007, the British Army had failed to defeat the IRA but {{made it impossible for}} them <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> violence. Operation Helvetic replaced Operation Banner in 2007, maintaining fewer service personnel in a more-benign environment. From 1971 to 1997, a total of 763 British military personnel were killed during the Troubles. About 300 deaths during the conflict were attributed to the British Army, including paramilitary troops and civilians.|$|E
5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>by</b> a head from Watercress.|$|E
