40|$|A passive twist {{control is}} {{proposed}} as an adaptive way {{to maximize the}} overall efficiency of the small-scale rotor blade for multifunctional aircrafts. Incorporated into a database of airfoil characteristics, Blade Element Momentum Theory is implemented to obtain the blade optimum twist rates for hover and forward flight. In order to realize the required <b>torsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> between hover and forward flight, glass/epoxy laminate blade is proposed based on Centrifugal Force Induced Twist concept. Tip mass is used to improve the nose-down torsion and the stabilization of rotating flexible blade. The laminate blades are tested in hover and forward flight modes, with deformations measured by Laser Displacement Sensor. Two Laser Displacement Sensors are driven by the tracking systems to scan the rotating blade from root to tip. The distance from blade surface to a reference plane can be recorded section by section. Then, a polynomial surface fitting is applied to reconstruct the shape of rotating blade, including the analysis of measurement precision based on the Kline–McClintock method. The results from deformation testings show that nose-down torsion is generated in each flight mode. The data from a Fluid Structure Interaction model agrees well with experimental results at an acceptable level {{in terms of the}} trend predictions...|$|E

40|$|A passive twist {{control is}} {{considered}} as an adaptive way {{to maximize the}} overall efficiency of a proprotor developed for convertible Micro Air Vehicles (MAV). Incorporated into a database <b>of</b> airfoil characteristics, <b>Blade</b> Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) is implemented to predict the performance of proprotors at low Reynolds numbers. Using this model, {{it is found that}} low twist allows for efficient hovering while high twist helps to forward flight. The Centrifugal Force Induced Twist (CFIT) concept is proposed to realize the required <b>torsion</b> <b>of</b> proprotor between hover and forward flight. Tip mass is used to provide the nose-down twisting moment by centrifugal force and stabilize the flexible blade. Classical Lamination Theory (CLT) is employed to estimate the <b>torsion</b> behavior <b>of</b> glass/epoxy laminate <b>blade</b> and to study the feasibility of CFIT concept. The results indicate that the predicted <b>torsion</b> <b>of</b> CFIT <b>blade</b> is <b>of</b> the same level with required deformation. The laminate blades were tested in hover and forward flight modes, with deformations measured by Laser Displacement Sensor (LDS). In rotor mode, the laminate blade can generate approximately - 9 ◦ torsion at blade tip rotating at 1, 300 RPM. By contrast, at 800 RPM and inflow velocity 8 m/s, it is capable of providing around - 5 ◦ torsion at blade tip in propeller mode...|$|R

The key feature of a VGOT machine is that each <b>blade,</b> instead <b>of</b> rotating around a central vertical axis, slides over rails mounted on a wagon formed by a tubular reticulated structure supported by standard train bogies. The structure should be designed to absorb the efforts in the vertical and traverse directions of the railroad due to the aerodynamic loads, the weight of the components and the centrifugal acceleration along the curved tracks.

40|$|The flutter {{stability}} of flap bending, lead-lag bending, and <b>torsion</b> <b>of</b> helicopter rotor <b>blades</b> in hover is investigated using a finite element formulation based on Hamilton's principle. The blade {{is divided into}} a number of finite elements. Quasi-steady strip theory is used to evaluate the aerodynamic loads. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved for steady-state blade deflections through an iterative procedure. The equations of motion are linearized assuming blade motion to be a small perturbation about the steady deflected shape. The normal mode method based on the coupled rotating natural modes is used {{to reduce the number of}} equations in the flutter analysis. First the formulation is applied to single-load-path blades (articulated and hingeless blades). Numerical results show very good agreement with existing results obtained using the modal approach. The second part of the application concerns multiple-load-path blades, i. e. bearingless blades. Numerical results are presented for several analytical models <b>of</b> the bearingless <b>blade.</b> Results are also obtained using an equivalent beam approach wherein a bearingless blade is modelled as a single beam with equivalent properties.

40|$|Active rotor control concepts, such {{as active}} twist actuation, have the {{potential}} to effectively reduce the noise and vibrations of helicopter rotors. Within the STAR (Smart Twisting Active Rotor) hover test, an active twist rotor was tested in the rotor preparation hall at DLR Braunschweig. The rotor blades were actuated with frequencies of 1 /rev – 5 /rev and peak <b>torsion</b> amplitudes <b>of</b> up to 2 °. This paper describes aerodynamic results from the hover test based on time-resolved stereoscopic PIV measurements at the forward blade tip position. Continuous time series of flow fields behind the blade tips were evaluated to investigate the young blade tip vortices between 3. 56 ° and 45. 74 ° of vortex age. For the unactuated baseline case, the vortex trajectory, blade tip scattering, and temporal development of the peak axial and swirl velocity are discussed. The effects of the active twist actuation on the blade tip vortices are examined for the 1 /rev and 3 /rev actuation frequencies. The variation of the vortex trajectories is dominated by the blade tip deflection for the 1 /rev actuation, and by the <b>torsion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> tip for the 3 /rev actuation. The 3 /rev actuation reduces the initial peak swirl velocity by up to 35 % compared to the baseline case. The actuation with the control phase angles 225 ° – 315 ° achieves a strong variation of the vortex trajectories with a vertical deviation of up to 2. 6 %R below the rotor tip path plane. The present aerodynamic investigation reveals a high control authority of the actuators – especially for the 3 /rev actuation frequency – on the vortex trajectories and the vortex strength, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the active twist concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a model {{helicopter}} rotor blade incorporating a swept tip is described. The swept tip is chosen to provide a coupling between the lift at the tip and the blade twist thus achieving a variation <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> tvist both with azimuth and with forward speed. The design is the first stop in an investigation of aeroelastic tailoring {{as a means of}} reducing helicopter vibration and increasing rotor performance. The first prototype blade encountered stability problems and further designs were evaluated using a new modes/stability computer program developed within RAE. Comparisons are made between the stresses measured on a second stable swept tip blade and a dynamically similar rectangular blade. The results show that a beneficial twisting of the swept tip blade is achieved which enhances rotor perforawtnee and reduces the flatvise bending and torsional moments. Comparisons are made between the experimental results and those predicted by the RAE/VOL coupled modes analysis. The predictions are. reasonably accurate for the flatwise moments but a more representative model of the hub is needed to produce acceptable predictions of the torsional moments. The {{design of a}} further set <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> is discussed, the aim being to investigate the effects of introducing a strong coupling between the flap and <b>torsion</b> notions <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> by sweeping back the shear centre. An analysis of-the results shows that there are large gains in blade stability with no severe adverse effects on blade loads. A theoretical investigation has been undertaken to observe the effects of tip sweep on the performance of a full size rotor. The results show that aft tip sweep can reduce control loads and rotor power for a rotor with a cambered aerofoil, section...|$|R

The impact <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> dynamics on blade section lift-coefficient time histories is studied by comparing predictions from both a rigid blade analysis and an elastic blade analysis with helicopter flight test data. The elastic blade analysis better predicts high-frequency behavior of section lift.
