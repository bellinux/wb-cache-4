This article aims to contribute to the literature on Beijing’s approach to this issue by providing a detailed empirical account of its involvement in a few core regime organisations. It argues that Beijing’s reform approach is guided by its domestically derived preferences for strong state authority and expanding China’s global power, but that its reform efforts are unlikely to succeed based on countervailing structural hard- and soft-power factors...|$|R

Different transient absorption dynamics of three different tautomeric forms of SA chromophore groups have been distinguished. Cis-keto and enol-closed tautomeric forms experience opening of pseudo-aromatic ring and fast relaxation to the conformationally distorted ground state of trans-keto tautomeric form. No tautomeric changes take place under direct excitation of the trans-keto tautomers. M.
