Referring to [...] "the late, great Freddie Mercury" [...] in their 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, Guns N' Roses quoted Mercury's lyrics from his song [...] "We Are the Champions"; [...] "I've <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> bows, my curtain calls, you've brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it, and I thank you all." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{rejects the}} notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling The Times in 1998: [...] "the {{tortured}} artist myth is rampant. People paint me {{as some kind of}} black witchcraft-practising devil from hell, that I have to be twisted and dark to do what I am doing. It's a load of rubbish". What is more, she later told Spin: [...] "some critics have <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> writing so literally to the point that they'll listen to 'Down by the Water' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her." ...|$|E

500|$|With the album, Badu {{sought to}} augment her music's production, expose {{the work of}} {{underground}} hip hop producers, and exceed listeners' expectations of contemporary music. She explained to Billboard that [...] "in taking on a project like this, I'm taking the responsibility to talk for my race and my planet." [...] In an interview for the New York Post, she explained the album to be about [...] "the war against self ... against your inner being", and said of her hiatus, [...] "I've always <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> time between albums. I'm a performing artist - recording is secondary to me. My performances are what drive me. It's like my therapy. I like to write a lot while I'm on the road before I even think about recording." [...] Badu also said that she now had a relevant message to express for listeners and was no longer struggling with a creative block.|$|E
500|$|Nitin Ganatra {{who plays}} Masood Ahmed {{explains}} to Digital Spy Masood's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away. [...] "Masood goes crazy over this!" [...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

In 1978, acting on a tip, Modesto Bee reporter Emmett Corrigan located Thompson at her mobile home in Space 24 of the Modesto Mobile Village and recognized her from the 40-year-old photograph. A letter Thompson wrote was published in The Modesto Bee and the Associated Press distributed a story headlined [...] "Woman Fighting Mad Over Famous Depression Photo." [...] Florence {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I wish she [...] hadn't <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> picture. I can't get a penny out of it. She didn't ask my name. She said she wouldn't sell the pictures. She said she'd send me a copy. She never did." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 14, finalist Jermaine Jones was disqualified for concealing {{arrests and}} {{outstanding}} warrants. Jones, however, {{denied that he}} had concealed his previous arrests, as he admitted his arrests when he signed up for Idol. A police official in a New Jersey town {{where he was the}} target of two arrest warrants said that [...] "the case wasn't big enough to merit going after him in California", and a New Jersey legislator commented that for the show [...] "to expose, embarrass and interrogate a young man without an attorney in front of 40 million viewers was an outrage". Critics suggested that the show may have staged the disqualification to boost ratings. When asked about speculations that producers had prior knowledge of his criminal past and that the producers were simply out to exploit him on-air, Jones replied that [...] "I haven’t even <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> mind into that and why they did what they did, because then I’ll drive myself crazy".|$|E
2500|$|Two special trains {{had been}} {{dispatched}} from Melbourne carrying police reinforcements, native police and reporters following {{the killing of}} Sherritt. Despite Ned's warning, Curnow, at about 3 am, grabbed his sister's red llama scarf, a candle and matches, and rushed to the railway line, and managed to stop the pilot train. He told the guard of the torn tracks and that the Kelly gang was laying in wait at the hotel. The guard then signalled the second train, carrying the police, to stop. The trains then quietly {{made their way to}} the station and at the station house the police met with Mrs. Stanistreet, the wife of the stationmaster, who said that, [...] "They have <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> husband away with a lot more into the bush." [...] Shortly after Bracken came rushing up and said, [...] "The Kellys are all at Jones's. Be quick, and surround the house, or they will be off." ...|$|E

2500|$|Armageddon was {{originally}} slated for release mid-2012, {{but it was}} delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, [...] "It's the longest I have spent with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready". He explained he had approached Armageddon {{in a different way}} than his previous albums, [...] "I haven't sat down to write an album, I've just been writing whatever I feel. I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch but it needs to be there and I think it lifts the album. [...] I've done most of it myself and I've really <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> time." [...] While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained it gave him a broader perspective, and while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song before. Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, [...] "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, do you love me too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that my little boy (Hudson) is going to inherit." [...] When asked to give five words that could describe the album Sebastian used the words [...] "dark", [...] "reflective", [...] "happy", [...] "appreciative" [...] and [...] "anxious".|$|E
