For optimizing the solar <b>tracking</b> mechanism electromechanical <b>systems</b> were evolved through implementation of different evolutional algorithms and methodologies. To present the tracker, a hybrid dual-axis solar <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> is designed, built, and tested based on both the solar map and light sensor based continuous tracking mechanism. These light sensors also compare the darkness and cloudy and sunny conditions assisting daily tracking. The designed tracker can track sun’s apparent position at different months and seasons; thereby the electrical controlling device requires a real time clock device for guiding the <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> in seeking solar position for the seasonal motion. So the combination of both of these tracking mechanisms made the designed tracker a hybrid one. The power gain and system power consumption are compared with a static and continuous dual axis solar <b>tracking</b> <b>system.</b> It is found that power gain of hybrid dual axis solar <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> is almost equal to continuous dual axis solar <b>tracking</b> <b>system,</b> whereas the power saved in system operation by the hybrid tracker is 44. 44 % compared to the continuous <b>tracking</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
