5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in the}} aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Court heard six {{original}} habeas {{cases of}} a criminal nature.

5|$|Apart {{from these}} exercises, the RLI Commandos garrisoned {{separate}} {{areas of the}} country; 1 Commando and the Battalion Headquarters were at Kariba, opposite the positions {{taken up by the}} Zambian Defence Force on the border. 2 Commando was at Chirundu, another town on the border with Zambia, and 3 Commando was split between Rhodesia's two Air Force bases: Salisbury's New Sarum base and Thornhill air base in Gwelo. The Battalion received its Queen's and regimental colours, approved two years earlier, from the colonial Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, on 19 June 1965. Meanwhile, negotiations between Smith and Harold Wilson's British Labour government broke down repeatedly throughout the year, leading the Rhodesian government <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965. Most RLI men supported Smith, the RF and UDI, and so saw this step as cause for celebration.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} beautify the coinage, five {{denominations}} of US coins had received new designs between 1907 and 1909. In 1911, Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head design for the nickel, and commissioned Fraser to do the work. They were impressed by Fraser's designs showing a Native American and an American bison. The designs were approved in 1912, but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, which made mechanisms to detect slugs in nickel-operated machines. The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser, and in February 1913, Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> coins despite the objections.|$|E

In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> approved $350,000 for its preservation.

5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's Lure of the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, {{the second}} stage in the legal process began when both Carrouges and Le Gris, with their followers, {{presented}} themselves before the Parlement of Paris at the Palais de Justice <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> formal challenge. This involved reciting their accusations and throwing down a gauntlet signifying their intention to fight. The declarations were pronounced {{in front of the}} King, his brother Louis of Valois and the entire Parlement, who decided to initially hear the case as an ordinary criminal one and defer their decision on whether to permit the judicial duel until both sides had given testimony. Attempts had been made to persuade Le Gris to insist on a church trial, but these proved unsuccessful as Le Gris wished to counter the accusation with a lawsuit against his opponent claiming 40,000 livres for defamation. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris.|$|E

Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss. In 1958, Braathens SAFE had 77,591 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months into}} his term, Dow {{inadvertently}} ran afoul {{of his own}} prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge {{had no choice but}} <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E
5|$|With {{the union}} {{threatening}} strike action, particularly at international matches, in April 1909 the Football Association insisted that all players agree {{to leave the}} union and pledge loyalty to the FA. Manchester United refused <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> revised contracts to its players, and FA suspended the entire squad. The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension, and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club's office before Mangnall persuaded them to return the items. The players continued to train, and captain Charlie Roberts {{came up with the}} name of Outcasts F.C. The FA organised a meeting of 200 players, excluding the Outcasts, but a rambling speech from chairman Charles Clegg failed to win them over, and an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA.|$|E

5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main {{schools of thought}} have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the World Zionist Organization, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|On July10, a {{tropical}} wave exited the African coast and moved westward over the open Atlantic for several days. Initially, the associated weather activity {{was limited to}} weak showers, and environmental conditions were not forecast to become conducive for significant organization. Although upper-level wind shear remained somewhat adverse, a process of slow development became evident by July19 as surface pressures began to fall. The wave proceeded along the extreme northeastern Caribbean, where convective activity waxed and waned due to periods of variable wind shear and brief land interaction with Hispaniola. By July22, thundershower activity reestablished over the Bahamas, with a distinct {{area of low pressure}} centered between the islands of Acklins and Great Inagua. Satellite observations confirmed a closed circulation, leading the National Hurricane Center (NHC) <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>the</b> formation of Tropical Depression Three around 1500UTC. However, post-storm analysis indicated that a depression had developed nine hours earlier than operationally confirmed. Upon its formation, the depression was forecast to be steered to the west-northwest along a well-established subtropical ridge. Later that day, minimum pressure dropped to 1006mbar (29.74inHg), and satellite imagery showed an establishment of favorable outflow in nearly all quadrants. Although its cloud pattern remained disorganizedwith the circulation center disassociated from the deepest convectiona reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone found that the winds had increased. It was therefore upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, about five hours after NHC initiated advisories on the system.|$|E
