Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception.

500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} advice {{he would give}} to his character, Barber said [...] "Unfortunately, I don't think he would listen {{to me in the}} first place, but if he could give me the time of day, I would say lighten up on the control because you’re never going to have it." [...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E

This tour began on July 31, 2012, in Springfield, Illinois, and ran through September 2, 2012, ending in Buffalo, New York. The Evanescence Tour resumed in October 2012 with stops in South America, Costa Rica and Panama. The tour wrapped with a series of shows in England, ending on November 9, 2012, in London's Wembley Arena. Lee stated the band plans to take an extended break after the tour, saying, [...] "At the end of any really long tour you need to get your head in order.

2500|$|Soon afterward, Terry Glenn was {{released}} to waivers. Owner Jerry Jones explained that, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the day, {{it had more}} to do with where we are right now, the managing of how he got to the field, the aspect of concentrating on the what ifs and how it might've impacted how we give our young players a chance, and how we evaluate that position." [...] The main story lines in camp have revolved around the new addition of Adam [...] "Pacman" [...] Jones, and the injury to Terence Newman. Jones was proving daily in camp that he is still worthy of being named one of the top cornerbacks in the league, but was not fully reinstated to the NFL until August 28. Newman injured his groin on July 28, and is expected to be out for three weeks.|$|E

Then {{he thought of his}} mother. Suddenly the dear soul had prior claim to Mrs. Doan. Above bitterness the son recalled the date; it was his thirty-second birthday. He told himself that nothing should keep him from the one who could best understand his predicament. This dear, sincere mother had counseled him before; why not now? The foolishness of troubling Mrs. Doan was clear. As he hastened on his way, he began to wonder what his mother would really think of the bishop's action. Would she accept her son's humiliation with serene, unqualified spirit? Would her faith in a superior's judgment hold? The suspended priest felt the terms for the true Catholic. He dreaded palliation of the bishop's course. But no--his mother could never do that. In the case in question her boy must stand injured, unjustly dealt with.|$|E

5000|$|While being {{transported to}} prison, Black Hand {{experiences}} a sudden power surge that kills his captors. Xander roams the desert, hearing a voice instructing him {{to reclaim the}} souls of characters who were reanimated. Hand murders his family and commits suicide. The Guardian Scar arrives, and creates the first black power ring, which reanimates Black Hand. She reveals that Hand is the physical embodiment of death, and serves as the avatar of the Black Lantern Corps {{in the same manner}} that Ion, Parallax, and the Predator are for willpower, fear, and love respectively. Hand later digs up Bruce Wayne's corpse, removes his skull, and recites the Black Lantern oath for the first time. Soon after, black power rings descend upon the universe and begin reviving the deceased as Black Lanterns that attack the heroes of the DC Universe. It is claimed the Power Battery is in Space Sector 666. Black Hand is seen holding Wayne's skull in all future appearances, embracing it in a necrophiliac manner in Blackest Night #1 as the black power rings appear from the Black Power Battery, exclaiming that Wayne's death [...] "plays a far greater role in the Blackest Night" [...] than anyone <b>thinks.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> issue, it's shown that Black Hand uses the skull to produce new power rings at will, creating two rings for the newly deceased Carter Hall and Kendra Saunders.|$|R

6000|$|My dear George--This Monday morning, the 27th, I have {{received}} your last, dated 12th July. You {{say you have}} not heard from England for three months. Then my letter from Shanklin, written, I <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> June, has not reach'd you. You shall not have cause to think I neglect you. I have kept this back a little time in expectation of hearing from Mr. Abbey. You will say I might have remained in town to be Abbey's messenger in these affairs. That I offered him, but he in his answer convinced {{me that he was}} anxious to bring the business to an issue. He observed, that by being himself the agent in the whole, people might be more expeditious. You say you have not heard for three months, and yet your letters have the tone of knowing how our affairs are situated, by which I conjecture I acquainted you with them in a letter previous to the Shanklin one. That I may not have done. To be certain, I will here state that it is in consequence of Mrs. Jennings threatening a chancery suit that you have been kept from the receipt of monies, and myself deprived of any help from Abbey. I am glad you say you keep up your spirits. I hope you make a true statement on that score. Still keep them up, for we are all young. I can only repeat here that you shall hear from me again immediately. Notwithstanding this bad intelligence, I have experienced some pleasure in receiving so correctly two letters from you, as it gives me, if I may so say, a distant idea of proximity. This last improves upon my little niece--kiss her for me. Do not fret yourself about the delay of money on account of my immediate opportunity being lost, for in a new country whoever has money must have an opportunity of employing it in many ways. The report runs now more in favour of Kean stopping in England. If he should, I have confident hopes of our tragedy. If he invokes the hot-blooded character of Ludolph,--and he is the only actor that can do it,--he will add to his own fame and improve my fortune. I will give you a half-dozen lines of it before I part as a specimen-- ...|$|E

60|$|WAUGANUI, December 3. A {{pleasant}} trip, yesterday, per Ballarat Fly. Four hours. I do {{not know}} the distance, but it must have been well along toward fifty miles. The Fly could have spun it out to eight hours and not discommoded me; for where there is comfort, and no need for hurry, speed is of no value--at least to me; and nothing that goes on wheels can be more comfortable, more satisfactory, than the New Zealand trains. Outside of America there are no cars that are so rationally devised. When you add the constant presence of charming scenery and the nearly constant absence of dust--well, if one is not content then, he ought to get out and walk. That would change his spirit, perhaps?
