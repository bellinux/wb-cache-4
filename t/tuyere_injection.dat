40|$|To {{accompany}} the introduction and subsequent optimisation of pulverised coal injection on BlueScope Steel’s Port Kembla blast furnaces, the combustion performance of an extensive range of contender coals {{was measured in}} a pilot scale combustion test rig providing a scaled physico-chemical simulation of the combustion of pulverised coal in blast furnace <b>tuyere</b> <b>injection.</b> In tests with air-cooled coaxial lance injection, combustion performance increased with increasing coal volatile matter and further, for each coal, showed a weak increase with increasing test O/C ratio (decreasing coal injection rate). In tests with medium to high inertinite content coals drawn from the Permian geological system of Eastern Australia, combustion performance was generally higher for the coals of the higher inertinite content. For these coals, significant fusibility of the inertinite component was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that {{the erosion of the}} hearth refractories is by part a major limitation of the longevity of the blast furnace. Addition of titania via burdening or <b>tuyere</b> <b>injection</b> increases the titanium content in the molten pig iron and is believed to promote the so-called titanium-rich scaffold on the hearth surface, to protect the hearth from subsequent erosion. However, control of the titanium-rich scaffold is challenging as furnace operating condition makes it impossible to visualise and make direct measurements of the complex process. Aimed to improve operational control, this thesis presents a series of numerical models. Firstly, an improved 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is developed to simulate the flow and heat transfer phenomena in the hearth. The model is validated by comparing the calculated temperatures with the thermocouple data available, where agreements are established within +- 3 %. Through extensive parametric studies, an accurate prediction of the flow and temperature distribution in the hearth is been made possible. Secondly, a 2 D two-phase multi-component CFD model is used to study the complex transport phenomena associated with the formation and dissolution of solid particles in the hearth. It is found that the isotherm of the equilibrium temperature of the incoming hot metal solution can be used as an excellent indicator to locate the extent of titanium compound particles. This shows that the particles in the hearth can be managed by adjusting this isotherm location by (a) altering the titanium dosage and/or (b) altering the hot metal pool temperature. Finally, a 3 D multi-component CFD model is developed to simulate the transport of titanium carbide particles in the blast furnace hearth during titania addition via burdening or <b>tuyere</b> <b>injection.</b> The effects of key operational parameters are investigated. Based on the results of 105 cases, a program that instantly presents graphical images of the TiC particle distribution along the bottom surface of the hearth of PK 5 BF of any operational condition set by the user is developed. The work carried out in this thesis provides useful information for blast furnace operators during the practice of titania addition...|$|E

40|$|Steelmaking {{today is}} carried out in batch processes. However, in many {{industries}} {{it has been found}} that continuous processes are more efficient than batch processes. In the 19602 ̆ 7 s it was shown in the WORCRA, IRSID and other trials {{that it is possible to}} produce a high quality refined steel continuously. The WORCRA process utilised counter-current flow of the slag phase with respect to the metal phase. One of the failings of this process that has been cited by others is low productivity. This was due, in part, to low mixing intensity in the melting region of the furnace. The current study is focussed on understanding the relationship between the melting zone mixing intensity and axial dispersion in an attached refining channel for a geometry similar to that of the WORCRA process. An important finding of this work was that changes in the mixing intensity had little effect on the dispersion in the refining channel. Other findings include, (1) there was a decrease in axial dispersion in the launder as the fluid flow rate was increased, (2) <b>tuyère</b> gas <b>injection</b> in the channel had no apparent influence on waves travelling along the channel, and (3) that the discontinuous nature of the ejection of water from the exit of the model was caused by slopping in the melting zone...|$|R
40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractory}} {{is a major}} limitation to the campaign life of a blast furnace. Titanium from titania addition in the burden or <b>tuyere</b> <b>injection</b> can react with carbon and nitrogen in molten pig iron to form titanium carbonitride, giving the so-called titanium-rich scaffold or buildup on the hearth surface, to protect the hearth from subsequent erosion. In the current article, a mathematical model based on computational fluid dynamics is proposed to simulate the behavior of solid particles in the liquid iron. The model considers the fluid/solid particle flow through a packed bed, conjugated heat transfer, species transport, and thermodynamic of key chemical reactions. A region of high solid concentration is predicted at the hearth bottom surface. Regions of solid formation and dissolution can be identified, which depend on the local temperature and chemical equilibrium. The sensitivity to the key model parameters for the solid phase is analyzed. The model provides an insight into the fundamental mechanism of solid particle formation, and it may form a basic model for subsequent development to study the formation of titanium scaffold in the blast furnace hearth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The Nkana smelter was {{initially}} commissioned in 1931, with two reverberatory furnaces, two Peirce-Smith converters, and blister copper casting facilities. Reverberatory furnaces were {{the mainstay of}} production up until 1994, when an El Teniente Converter (CT) was installed to upgrade reverberatory furnace matte to white metal, prior to converting in conventional Peirce-Smith (PS) converters. In 2000, a decision was taken to increase the proportion of concentrate smelted in the CT by introduction of bone-dry concentrate injection through the tuyeres. A flash dryer with a nominal capacity of 1 200 metric tons per day of dry product, and associated <b>tuyere</b> <b>injection</b> system was commissioned in March 2004. Based on the projected concentrate arisings from the KCM mines into the future, as seen in 2004, {{it was decided to}} develop the CT to be the primary smelting vessel at Nkana, to handle a minimum of 1 250 tons per day of concentrate, and to operate only one reverberatory furnace in slag-cleaning mode pending a full evaluation of alternative slag-cleaning technologies. The anticipated cathode production from Nkana was to be in the range 140 to 150 000 tons per annum. This paper details the outcomes from trials that were carried out in August and September 2004, using two reverberatory furnaces for slag cleaning. The results of these trials, plus further work in October and November, provided confidence to move to one reverberatory furnace for slag cleaning in December 2004. With the advent of Vedanta as the majority shareholder in KCM at the end of 2004, the approach has been to maximize the available smelting capacity. Currently, two reverberatory furnaces and the CT are on-line, with the higher silica concentrates going to the reverberatory furnaces with an appropriate amount of pyrite, and the cleaner concentrates going to the CT. Expansion of the smelter is currently under investigation...|$|E
40|$|Based on 100 % pellets {{operation}} at BF No. 3 at SSAB Tunnplåt in Luleå a new pellet with CaO/SiO 2 = 1 was developed during early nineties. The pellet showed good results in metallurgical laboratory test but caused slag formation {{problems in the}} bosh. A high basicity slag was formed during interaction with basic fluxes and its melting point was increased when the slag was finally reduced. By injection of basic fluxes, the slag formation problems in the bosh can be avoided. Without a sinter plant, dusts have to be recycled in a cold bonded briquette. Injection of some of BF flue dust would improve {{the properties of the}} briquette and may be beneficial for the BF process. Based on top charging or tuyere-injection of basic fluxes and the injection of BF flue dust studies have been done. The studies carried out will clarify some phenomena of slag formation and the effect of co- injection on coal combustion in the blast furnace, including the effect of: 1) basic fluxes on slag formation in the blast furnace, if they are top- charged; 2) basic fluxes on slag formation in the blast furnace, if they are tuyere injected; 3) chemical composition and metallurgical properties of pellet and fluxes on slag formation; 4) reduction conditions on (reduction temperature, reducing gas composition) on bosh slag formation; 5 co- injection of BOF slag or BF flue dust on coal combustion efficiency and BF performance. From the results, it can be concluded that the interaction between pellets and fluxes starts when softening and melting starts in the cohesive layer. By choosing fluxes of a high melting point the dissolution of them in the bosh slag can be delayed and the excessive basicity of the bosh slag can be limited. A basic flux with a low melting point will easily dissolve into the bosh slag causing its basicity to increase, which is beneficial to S refining when acid pellets are used. The formation of a bosh slag of excessive basicity (which causes BF operation disturbances, because its high melting point, increases further during reduction) can be avoided by <b>tuyere</b> <b>injection</b> of basic fluxes with the coal. The positive effect is greatest when a fluxed pellet of basicity B 2  1 and with a high Fe content is used as ferrous burden. In this case, the slag amount can be significantly decreased. BOF slag has suitable high-temperature properties for use as a basic flux in combination with e. g., olivine pellets. It has a low softening and melting temperature, does not shrink, is slowly reduced in the BF shaft and its properties are almost unaffected by the partial reduction occurring in the shaft of the BF. BOF slag absorbs a low content of alkalies, which causes volume increase at elevated temperatures, when the basicity is still high. The results indicate that co-injection of BOF slag or BF flue dust with PC has positive effects on the BF operation. The injection of BOF slag decreases the Si content in HM by an increased basicity of the slag formed during combustion leading to a decreased activity of SiO 2 in the slag and by an increased FeO content in the tuyere slag that will be reduced by SiFe in the metal at the tuyere level, if the SiFe is initially high. The consumption of reducing agents can be reduced because of a decreased Si content in HM and a decreased slag amount. The permeability is improved by prohibiting the formation of a shell at the raceway end because of improved melting properties of tuyere slag caused by an increased basicity and FeO content, consumption of coal and coke fines by FeO and improved radial transport of tuyere slag. The injection of BOF slag improves the bosh slag because an excessive basicity caused by top-charged fluxes added for neutralisation of coal and coke ashes and non-uniform slag formation caused by uneven distribution of top-charged fluxes are avoided. The productivity increases because of the possibility to decrease the slag amount. The injection of BOF slag can be done without negative effects on combustion efficiency by using very finely ground BOF slag and because of improved total consumption of coal and coke fines by direct reduction in the coke bed. The injection of BF flue dust decreases the Si content in HM by an increased FeO content of the tuyere slag that will be reduced by SiFe in the metal at the tuyere level, if the SiFe is initially high. The consumption of coal and coke is decreased because of a high of C content in BF flue dust and the decreased Si content in HM. The permeability is improved by prohibiting the formation of a shell at the raceway end because of consumption of coal and coke fines by FeO and improved melting properties of tuyere slag promoting the radial transport of the tuyere slag. The injection of BF flue dust can be done without negative effects on the total consumption of coal and coke fines by direct reduction in the coke bed. Injected BF flue dust supplies oxygen for combustion, but because of endothermic reactions as reduction of hematite and calcination of limestone occurring in the BF flue dust at the same temperatures as release and disintegration of VM, it will {{have a negative effect on}} the combustion of HV coal. SSAB Luleå and SSAB Oxelösund have started up projects aiming to make tuyere- injection of BF flue dust part of the standard BF operation. Godkänd; 2004; 20070416 (ysko...|$|E
