5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E
5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface {{area to volume ratio}} of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new image segmenta-tion scheme {{that is based on}} bidirectional labeling and registra-tion and prove that its segmentation performance is equivalent to that of the conventional watershed segmentation algorithm. The proposed bidirectional labeling and registration scheme, which we refer to as bidirectional labeling and registration scheme (BIDS), involves only linear scans of image pixels. It uses one-dimensional operations rather than the queues that are used in traditional seg-mentation algorithms, which are two-dimensional problems. BIDS also provides unique labels for individual homogeneous regions. In addition <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> segmentation results, BIDS is four times less computationally complex than the conventional water-shed by immersion technique.

Performance comparisons are made between filters using the inertial navigation equations and the dynamic model for the fault-free conditions.

Following its tepid commercial performance, Columbia aimed for Music Box to be a vehicle for very commercial singles that could garner strong radio airplay. The album was formed as a pop record, and more mainstream than anything on Emotions. Music Box went on to sell over 32 million copies worldwide, and earned its place among the best-selling albums of all time. Due to the album's success, Columbia allowed Carey more control over the music she recorded for Daydream (1995).|$|E

5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Recently, Peng and Chi et al. {{proposed}} a block-by-block blind post-FFT multistage beamforming algorithm (MSBFA) based on subcarrier averaging for a multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which works well under multipath block fading channels {{even in the}} presence of correlated paths. However, the MSBFA is a sequential path-by-path detection algorithm, thereby resulting in long detection latency as the total number of paths of all the active users is large. In this paper, a blind multistage user-by-user beamforming algorithm (UUBFA) is proposed, which, in contrast to the MSBFA, detects all the path signals for one individual user and meanwhile <b>achieves</b> <b>the</b> maximum diversity gain through a blind maximum ratio combining processing at each stage. In addition <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> performance as <b>the</b> MSBFA, the parallel signal processing structure of the proposed UUBFA is well suited to software and hardware implementations.

40|$|Today, {{computer}} data {{networks are}} being used everywhere around us. To increase reliability most of such networks use redundant links, {{which may not be}} fully utilized at all times. The reason lies with the routing protocols, which are used to detect network faults, and at all times direct all traffic only across the best path. By doing this only the optimal path is taken advantage of, while others are idle. High end routers have the capability to redirect part of the traffic across arbitrary path, at administrator’s discretion, while maintaining fault tolerance. These mechanisms are referred to as traffic engineering. They allow to define virtual pathways which are bounded by capacity constraints of the network and demand of the traffic. This thesis compares different simple approaches <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> functionality or at least allowing partial traffic redirection with fault tolerance. It describes approaches with metric modification, traffic load sharing, and use of traffic tunnels and compares these to traffic engineering regarding scalability and configuration complexity. ...|$|R

In implementing Mandatory Access Control (MAC), SELinux is a MAC mechanism that provides domain type enforcement and role-based access control, while grsecurity employs Access Control Lists (ACLs). We describe and quantify the differences between the two, in terms of ease of use, installation, MAC implementation, and performance. We determine that SELinux has a stronger MAC implementation, while grsecurity is simpler to use and offers other exclusive features, such as address space protection and resource limiting. We show that although SELinux and grsecurity use two different approaches <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> goal, relative overall performance remains consistent. ...|$|R
