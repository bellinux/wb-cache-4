5|$|At this time, the {{dreadnought}} design had {{not been}} fully validated, despite {{the success of the}} British namesake; for example, there were still concerns that the Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement—which {{had not been}} utilized on the original Dreadnought, but was also being installed on the American —would cause blast <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> crew in the lower turret. Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during São Paulos gun trials in June 1910.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2002, Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's book, Smallville: Dragon, {{which had}} Clark being hypnotized {{into believing that}} he was a normal, human teenager, with no abilities. Little's Flight featured Clark trying to lend emotional support to a young girl who has full-sized wings. The next Aspect novel, Hauntings, followed Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in one of Smallville's haunted houses. Animal Rage followed Clark as he tries to stop an animal rights activist when she tries <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> people harming animals in Smallville. Aspect brought in Dean Wesley Smith for their next novel, Whodunit, which involved Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigating the murder of a boy and his sister.|$|E

Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-native species, predominantly giant reed, castor bean and tobacco tree, native plant species in the watershed began to die out. As giant reed is not suitable habitat for many species, areas infested by giant reed are biologically dead in comparison with unaffected areas. It can grow extremely fast, removing too much water from the creek, and during flood events, {{many parts of the}} giant reed can wash downstream and re-establish themselves as a new colony, increasing the problem. Along with increasing concentrations of nutrients from fertilizer and other substances contained in runoff, algal blooms began <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> water quality of the creek, especially above Sulphur Creek Reservoir. The historically seasonal creek was replaced with a constant flow of polluted water from several large storm drains and many smaller ones.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the violent}} {{confrontation}} at Amona between the Israeli police and teenage activists in early 2006, HaKohen and fellow activist Elie Yossef {{went on a}} three-week hunger strike vigil protesting the violence. The activists displayed banners and handed out flyers calling on both the Israeli government and settler leadership to seek ways to avoid future bloodshed. As this took place just before national elections, the hunger strike drew criticism from some settlers who had felt victimized {{by the government and}} sought to use the tragedy as a means <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> ruling Kadima party in the polls. The government had no official response to the vigil.|$|E

25|$|O. bauri {{is able to}} {{recognize}} other workers from different nests by antennation. This process happens when two ants are front to front of one another, and either one is touching the other’s antennae with their antennae or head. There are four different behavioral patterns that may result after recognition of the other ant. These are basic alertness, alarm, attack with mandibles or attack with sting. Basic alertness occurs when both ants open their mandibles to about 180°. Alarm is composed of both basic alertness with fast random body movements and release of alarm pheromone. Attack with mandibles is a pattern in which the trap jaw ant will use its mandibles in order to strike {{a blow to the}} opponent. Attack with sting is when the trap jaw ant will bend its abdomen forward and try to use its sting <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> opponent.|$|E

25|$|At {{the fall}} of Napoleon in 1814, Lays {{was one of the}} Emperor's most {{prominent}} favourites, so when the allied armies entered Paris under the leadership of Tsar Alexander I, he was understandably worried about his own future. On 2 April, Talleyrand ordered the Opéra to mount a performance in honour of the tsar. The opera chosen, Le triomphe de Trajan by Persuis and Lesueur, had originally been given in 1807 to celebrate Napoleon's return to the capital. Not wanting <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> French public's feelings, Alexander requested a staging of Spontini's La vestale instead, an opera in which Lays always assumed the role of Cinna. At the end of the performance, the angry audience forced Lays – still dressed in his Roman toga – to return to the stage and recite some popular verses thanking the tsar for restoring the Bourbons. According to the brothers Michaud, Alexander was moved to compassion by the sight of the terrified singer and sent one of his aides-de-camp on stage to reassure him.|$|E
25|$|Pilot whale hunt is an {{integral}} part of Faroese social culture. As the attenders of a grindadráp usually are men, women do usually not actively take part in it, but are bystanders or onlookers. This is part of the traditional division of labor concerning pilot whaling which is centuries old, and has only changed little over time, though the method has changed quite a lot, considering that the boats nowadays have engines and most of the original weapons used to slaughter the whales are now forbidden. It is not allowed <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> whales in any way, and the killing must be done as fast as possible and can according to the new grind law only be done by using a new kind of weapon which in Faroese is called mønustingari. Another tool which is allowed and must be used is a round hook, which is put into the blow hole of the whale in order to drag the whale ashore. The whale must be ashore or at least be stuck on the seabed before it can be put down.|$|E
25|$|In the mines, Emma {{interrupts}} the dwarves' work {{by taking}} Happy's pickaxe. This infuriated the dwarves, {{causing them to}} take their complaints to David and Mary Margaret. They interrupt David, Mary Margaret and Regina from researching what they were searching for in Camelot: The Crimson Crown. Following the dwarves' complaints, David blames himself for not saving Emma. However, David is interrupted by Arthur, who tells David that key items from his camp, including a magic bean that would take the displaced Camelot residents home, is missing. David and Arthur stop by the pawnshop first to acquire an item, then begin their search at the Arthurians' camp, where David asks the campers to drink from the Chalice of Vengeance. This points him {{in the direction of}} the thief, revealed to be Arthur's squire, Grif, who immediately takes off on horseback, which leads to David and Arthur chasing Grif in David's pickup. David gives Arthur a crash course lesson in driving as he takes a piece of wood, using it as a makeshift joust, and knocks Grif off his horse. Grif later wakes up in the Sheriff's jail and admits that he was tired of how he was being treated, causing him to want <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> King. However, there was no magic bean found among the stolen items, but at the camp, David recognized the Crimson Crown on the ground and took it to Regina, who had also seen the question mark that she had handwritten on its illustration back in Camelot.|$|E

500|$|Thompson filed {{a lawsuit}} {{on behalf of the}} parents of three {{children}} killed in the Heath High School shooting in 1997. Investigations showed that the perpetrator, 14-year-old Michael Carneal, had regularly played various computer games (including Doom, Quake, Castle Wolfenstein, Redneck Rampage, Nightmare Creatures, MechWarrior, and Resident Evil) and accessed some pornographic websites. Carneal had also owned a videotape of The Basketball Diaries, which includes a high school student dreaming about shooting his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the Internet sites were negligent in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence. Additional claims included product liability for making [...] "defective" [...] products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, for distributing this material to minors. Said Thompson, [...] "We intend to hurt Hollywood. We intend <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> video game industry. We intend <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>the</b> sex porn sites." ...|$|E
