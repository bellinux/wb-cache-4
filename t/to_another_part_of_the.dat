5|$|The Crusaders' main home {{ground was}} the 36,000-capacity AMI Stadium in Christchurch.

Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it. The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.|$|E
5|$|Once {{secretory}} proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that {{will remain in the}} cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{carried a}} total of nearly 300people, {{including}} soldiers, artisans and craftsmen, sixCatholic missionaries, eightmerchants, and over a dozen women and children. Shortly after their departure, France and Spain ceased hostilities, and Louis was no longer interested in sending La Salle further assistance. Details of the voyage were kept secret so that Spain would not learn about it. La Salle's naval commander, the Sieur de Beaujeu, resented La Salle's keeping their destination until the party was well underway. The discord between the two intensified {{when they reached the}} island of Santo Domingo and quarreled over where to anchor. Beaujeu sailed <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, allowing Spanish privateers to capture the St. François, which had been fully loaded with supplies, provisions, and tools for the colony.|$|E

5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
25|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1986, {{investigators}} in Rostov theorized that the unknown killer may have moved <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and continued killing there. As the three victims killed in the Rostov Oblast in 1985 and 1986 had died in August, some investigators gave credence to the possibility the perpetrator may have relocated <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, and may only be returning to the Rostov Oblast in summer. The Rostov police compiled bulletins {{to be sent to}} all forces throughout the Soviet Union, describing the pattern of wounds their unknown killer inflicted upon his victims and requesting feedback from any police force who had discovered murder victims with wounds matching those upon the victims found in the Rostov Oblast. The response was negative.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{breast cancer}} cells {{look the same}} whether they {{are found in the}} breast or have spread <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. So, if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung {{contains}} cells that look like breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.|$|E

25|$|McLean was at corps {{headquarters}} with Devens {{when the}} attack happened (Howard {{had left the}} area, inexplicably escorting reinforcements <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battlefield). As Confederates were approaching the Ohio Brigade's position, McLean implored Devens for orders to turn their front. Devens refused, possibly {{because he had been}} using brandy to dull the pain of a leg injury that occurred the previous day, when his horse ran him into a tree. As a result, the Ohio Brigade managed an impromptu defense, and even attempted a counterattack, before being driven back towards Chancellorsville. Devens was shot in the foot during the retreat, giving McLean command of the division again. They reformed on Mineral Springs Road, northeast of Chancellorsville and away from any fighting, {{with the rest of the}} XI Corps.|$|E
25|$|Cecil—named after Cecil Rhodes—and another lion {{believed}} to be Cecil's brother were noticed in Hwange National Park in 2008. During 2009, the two lions encountered an established pride, {{which resulted in a}} fight in which Cecil's brother was killed and both Cecil and the leader of the pride were seriously wounded; the leader was subsequently killed by park rangers because of the wounds he had received in the fight with Cecil. Cecil retreated <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park where he eventually established his own pride which had as many as 22 members. During 2013, Cecil was forced out from the area by two young male lions into the eastern border of the park. There, he created a coalition with another male lion named Jericho to establish two prides which consisted of Cecil, Jericho, half a dozen females and up to a dozen cubs sired by Cecil or Jericho.|$|E

500|$|The {{security}} forces attempted {{to prevent the}} rural blacks from cooperating with ZANLA by instituting collective punishment on villages where cadres were known to have received assistance: for example, curfews would be imposed, and schools and stores closed.

500|$|From 1996, {{the website}} of the Colchester tourist board {{attributed}} {{the origin of}} the rhyme to a cannon recorded as used from the church of St Mary-at-the-Wall by the Royalist defenders in the siege of 1648. In 1648, Colchester was a walled town with a castle and several churches and was protected by the city wall. The story given was that a large cannon, which the website claimed was colloquially called Humpty Dumpty, was strategically placed on the wall. A shot from a Parliamentary cannon succeeded in damaging the wall beneath Humpty Dumpty which caused the cannon to tumble to the ground. The Royalists (or Cavaliers, [...] "all the King's men") attempted to raise Humpty Dumpty on <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, but the cannon was so heavy that [...] "All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again". Author Albert Jack claimed in his 2008 book Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes that there were two other verses supporting this claim. Elsewhere, he claimed to have found them in an [...] "old dusty library, [...] an even older book", but did not state what the book was or where it was found. It has been pointed out that the two additional verses are not {{in the style of the}} seventeenth century or of the existing rhyme, and that they do not fit with the earliest printed versions of the rhyme, which do not mention horses and men.|$|E
