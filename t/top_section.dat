5|$|The chase {{involving}} the double-decker bus was filmed with a second-hand London bus adapted {{by having a}} <b>top</b> <b>section</b> removed, and then placed back in situ running on ball bearings {{to allow it to}} slide off on impact. The stunts {{involving the}} bus were performed by Maurice Patchett, a London Transport bus driving instructor.|$|E
5|$|In 1724 the 14th century spire of the Church of the Holy Ghost in Crowcombe {{was damaged}} by a {{lightning}} strike. The <b>top</b> <b>section</b> of the spire was removed {{and is now}} planted in the churchyard, and stone from the spire {{was used in the}} flooring of the church. Inside the church, carved bench-ends dating from 1534 depict such pagan subjects as the Green Man and the legend of the men of Crowcombe fighting a two-headed dragon.|$|E
5|$|The software's {{database}} uses tournament summaries {{such as the}} 'Sample Tournament Summary' {{example and}} hand histories to provide a three section summary (see infobox screenshot). The <b>top</b> <b>section</b> of the general information tab provides tournament summaries of profit/loss as well as ordinal placement summary. The other sections summarize situational statistics based {{on the level of}} the blinds and the starting hand. Additional tabs in the software produce detailed information for various statistical interests.|$|E

25|$|Failure is {{not simply}} defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the {{perforated}} <b>top</b> <b>sections</b> of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.|$|R
5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists {{at the point where the}} Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller <b>top</b> <b>section</b> and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E
5|$|The spire can {{be divided}} into three sections. The lower section, which is the base, is formed of seven {{superimposed}} layers, each layer representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is {{in the shape of a}} bell; however the roundness has been flattened to create a four sided shape. This represents the stupa in which the Buddha's ashes have been interred. The <b>top</b> <b>section</b> is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or the crystal dew drop signifying the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on its four sides; as well as being the symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical creatures of the Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.|$|E
5|$|The <b>top</b> <b>section</b> of Princes Street, {{from the}} Octagon to the Exchange, {{has long been}} the hub of Dunedin's public {{transport}} system. Buses from the north of the city largely pass along George Street and into the Octagon, those from the south pass into the southern end of Princes Street, and those from the hill suburbs arrive at the Octagon via Stuart Street or at the Exchange via High and Rattray Streets. Almost all of these use upper Princes Street between the Exchange and the Octagon as part of their route.|$|E

The laboratory lay like a tin can, torn apart by mighty explosions, its first floors visible from the air. Men and cars were pouring down into it, fighting with the guards swarming to the surface.|$|R
5|$|Although predators of phoronids are {{not well}} known, they include fish, {{gastropods}} (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). Phoronopsis viridis, which reaches densities of 26,500 per square meter on tidal flats in California (USA), is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators, including fish and crabs. The unpalatability is strongest in the <b>top</b> <b>section,</b> including the lophophore, which is exposed to predators when phoronids feed. When the lophophores were removed in an experiment, the phoronids were more palatable, but this effect reduced over 12 days as the lophophores regenerated. These broadly effective defenses, which appear unusual among invertebrates inhabiting soft sediment, may be important in allowing Phoronopsis viridis to reach high densities. Some parasites infest phoronids: progenetic metacercariae and cysts of trematodes in phoronids' coelomic cavities; unidentified gregarines in phoronids' digestive tract; and an ancistrocomid ciliate parasite, Heterocineta, in the tentacles.|$|E

25|$|A {{segmented}} liṅga is a linga post {{divided into}} three sections to represent the three aspects of the Hindu godhead or trimurti: the lowest section, square in shape, represents Brahma; the middle section, octagonal in shape, represents Vishnu, and the <b>top</b> <b>section,</b> circular in shape, represents Shiva.|$|E
25|$|The Cuche Formation {{contains}} unique Placoderm fish fossils, first {{noted by}} Mojica and Villarroel in 1984. Across the section, also plant fossils and bivalves are found. In {{this part of}} the sequence the first fish fossils were discovered. The <b>top</b> <b>section</b> provided brachiopods (genus Lingula) and other at that moment undetermined fossil fragments.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of brassicasterol in a core sample from Loch Striven, Scotland. Highest values {{may be seen}} in the <b>top</b> <b>sections</b> of the sediment, which decrease with depth. However, the cholesterol behaves in a similar manner, and the ratio brassicasterol/cholesterol is fairly uniform at all depths, indicating either a comparable degradation rate with no change in source or different degradation rates and a change in source.|$|R

Castroneves improved to second ahead of Kanaan, who would subsequently lose his bets lap and {{drop out of}} the top six, Franchitti and Briscoe. Power having led much of the session stopped early and had a nervous wait as his time was rapidly bettered, but made it through with Hunter-Reay joining the Firestone Fast Six.|$|R

The team finished level on points with Annadale, winning a test match by two goals to one to gain their place in Senior League One.|$|E
25|$|The {{interchangeability}} of {{the equation}} may be represented by a triangle, where V (voltage) {{is placed on the}} <b>top</b> <b>section,</b> the I (current) is placed to the left section, and the R (resistance) is placed to the right. The line that divides the left and right sections indicate multiplication, and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).|$|E
50|$|Up to latitudes 41°44′11.8″N/S, the map is {{projected}} {{according to the}} Sinusoidal projection’s transformation. The higher latitudes are the <b>top</b> <b>sections</b> of a Mollweide projection, grafted to the Sinusoidal midsection where {{the scale of the}} two projections matches. This grafting results in a kink in the meridians along the parallel of the graft. The projection’s equal-area property follows from the fact that its source projections are themselves both equal-area.|$|R
50|$|Two {{pairs of}} french doors with glass panels to the <b>top</b> <b>sections</b> {{are located in}} the rear {{elevation}} and two similarly detailed single doors are located {{at the rear of the}} southern elevation. Evenly spaced double hung windows are located along the remainder of this side and along the opposite side. Gable end vents are centrally located in each gable end, the front one comprising three louvred arched forms.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the shaft}} {{is to be}} used for {{hoisting}} it is frequently split into multiple compartments by Shaft Sets, these may be made of either timber or steel. Vertical members in a shaft set are called Guides, horizontal members are called Buntons. For steel shaft guides, the main two options are hollow structural <b>sections</b> and <b>top</b> hat <b>sections.</b> <b>Top</b> hat <b>sections</b> offer a number of advantages over hollow structural sections including simpler installation, improved corrosion resistance and increased stiffness. Mine conveyances run on the guides in a similar way to how a steel roller coaster runs on its rails, both having wheels which keep them securely in place.|$|R
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} mainly {{an era of}} {{consolidation}} of the techniques developed in the previous century. Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialized for different roles. Jointed rods became common {{from the middle of}} the century and bamboo came to be used for the <b>top</b> <b>section</b> of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Another emperor to {{adorn the}} Hippodrome was Theodosius the Great, who in 390 brought an obelisk from Egypt and erected {{it inside the}} racing track. Carved from pink granite, it was {{originally}} erected at the Temple of Karnak in Luxor {{during the reign of}} Thutmose III in about 1490 BC. Theodosius had the obelisk cut into three pieces and brought to Constantinople. The <b>top</b> <b>section</b> survives, and it stands today where Theodosius placed it, on a marble pedestal. The obelisk has survived nearly 3,500 years in astonishingly good condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} a BEA requirement for a 100-seat aircraft to replace their Viscounts. The original Type 870 design was then modified when TCA expressed their interest in the design as well, and Vickers returned the updated Type 950 that filled both requirements. The main difference between the Viscount and Vanguard was {{the construction of the}} fuselage. The Vanguard started with the original Viscount fuselage, but cut it off about halfway up from the bottom, replacing the <b>top</b> <b>section</b> with a larger-diameter fuselage to give it a double bubble cross-section (similar to the Boeing Stratocruiser). The result of the larger upper portion was a roomier interior, with increased cargo capacity below the floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{reason is that}} most {{armoured}} vehicles have thinner armour {{on the roof of}} the turret and on the engine deck, so an anti-tank guided missile (from an attack helicopter or ground-attack jet) hitting them from the top can be deadly even if it has a small warhead. Even a small automatic cannon is powerful enough to penetrate the rear and <b>top</b> <b>sections</b> of the engine compartment of a tank.|$|R
