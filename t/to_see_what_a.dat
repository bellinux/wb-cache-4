5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up {{the details of the}} various scenes.|$|E
25|$|Only {{young men}} of the order were chosen to commit murder; above them were older heads holding high office and, {{in a variety of}} ways, {{displaying}} executive ability. They were quick <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> weapon to their hand was universal suffrage, and, with the aptitude for politics which the Irish have shown in our country, they developed their order into a political power to be reckoned with. Numbering in Schuylkill county only 500 or 600 out of 5,000 Irishmen in a total population of 116,000, the Molly Maguires controlled the common schools and the local government of the townships in the mining sections of the county. They elected at different times three county commissioners and came near electing one of their number, who had acquired twenty thousand dollars worth of property, Associate Judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. In one borough a Molly was Chief of Police; another in Mahanoy township, Jack Kehoe, was High Constable.|$|E

2500|$|According to author H. Reid in his 1961 book The Virginian Railway, investors {{recalled}} {{the rapid growth}} of Roanoke between 1882 and 1884, which had been nicknamed the [...] "Magic City" [...] when the Norfolk and Western [...] (N) had established major facilities at the former bucolic location which had been earlier known as Big Lick. Comparisons were made when speculating about Victoria's future potential. They could also look to nearby Crewe on the N (about 20 miles away from Victoria) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> substantial volume of activity and employment a division point on a steam railroad could bring. Predictably, land sales at Victoria were brisk, and buildings (and jobs) soon followed.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{laboratory}} on 2 October 1925, Baird successfully transmitted the first television picture with a greyscale image: {{the head of}} a ventriloquist's dummy nicknamed [...] "Stooky Bill" [...] in a 30-line vertically scanned image, at five pictures per second. Baird went downstairs and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> human face would look like, and Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range. Looking for publicity, Baird visited the Daily Express newspaper to promote his invention. The news editor was terrified and he was quoted by one of his staff as saying: [...] "For God's sake, go down to reception and get rid of a lunatic who's down there. He says he's got a machine for seeing by wireless! Watch him — he may have a razor on him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eggleston {{taught at}} Harvard in 1973 and 1974, {{and it was}} during these years that he {{discovered}} dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: [...] "It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{first three}} terms, {{excepting}} the factor of γ(v), is the velocity {{as seen by}} the observer in their own reference frame. The γ(v) {{is determined by the}} velocity v between the observer's reference frame and the object's frame, which is the frame in which its proper time is measured. This quantity is invariant under Lorentz transformation, so <b>to</b> check <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> observer in a different reference frame sees, one simply multiplies the velocity four-vector by the Lorentz transformation matrix between the two reference frames.|$|R
2500|$|Sykes's {{first job}} as Camouflage Staff Officer was to {{camouflage}} the [...] "enormous" [...] 70-mile-long (110km) railway {{line from the}} sea to the railhead at Misheifa, essential to bring up military materiel for Operation Crusader. On timidly entering his first staff meeting, the commander, Brigadier Robertson, memorably asked him, [...] "Who the hell are you?". Sykes replied [...] "Camouflage, sir". Robertson showed Sykes the plan for the railhead with depot, marshalling yard, sidings, sheds and facilities. [...] "How {{are you going to}} hide this lot then?", he asked. Sykes suggested a dummy railhead, and was astonished when the brigadier agreed. Later that same day, Sykes proposed a plan to build a 9-mile (14km) dummy railway ending in a real-looking terminus complete with sidings and buildings. The dummy had two purposes: to divert aerial attacks from the real railhead, and to deceive the enemy into believing that the British attack would not begin until the dummy was completed. Sykes was determined not to make the mistake of the new units with easily spotted camouflage nets. He asked the Royal Air Force to fly him over the real railhead <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> mock-up would have to resemble. His plan was to make it good enough to deceive an observer flying at [...] or higher, relying on the desert heat haze to make precise observation impossible. Materials were in short supply, so the available wood, just [...] of timber, was doubled by laboriously splitting it in half lengthways, by hand. Since Sykes's calculations showed there would still not be enough material, he decided to scale the whole railway down to 2/3 of life size.|$|E

To liquidate the dilemma between development and preservation, it is necessary to proceed with the design and construction of fishways, on one hand, and to seek, on the other hand, to secure fishery resources preserve the species by determining how far and how fast river development should go. This is only possible by developing optimum fishway systems according to field demonstrative studies. This paper describes the modelling of maintainable optimum fishway systems, mainly from the technical approach, and shows their predictability...|$|R

5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans <b>a</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> opposition can or cannot do.
