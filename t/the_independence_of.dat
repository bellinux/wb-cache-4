5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> Pakistan and the {{partition}} of Bengal in 1947, {{there have been more}} attempts to compile and publish an encyclopedia. The first was a project to produce a Bengali adaptation of Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia by Franklin Book Programs Inc., undertaken in 1959 and aborted ten years later. The unfinished papers were compiled into four unequal volumes as Bangla Visvacos (1972) with Khan Bahadur Abdul Hakim as the chief editor. After <b>the</b> <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> Bangladesh in 1971, three specialized encyclopedias were published - the multi-volume Islami Bishwakosh (Encyclopedia of Islam, 1986) by Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, 5-volume Shishu-Biswakosh (Encyclopedia for Children, 1995) by Bangladesh Shishu Academy, and 4-volume Vijnan Biswakosh (Encyclopedia of Science, 1998) by Bangla Academy.|$|E

5|$|As {{hostilities}} renewed, San Martín organized several guerrilla {{groups in}} the countryside, and laid siege to Lima, but did not force his entry, as {{he did not want}} to appear as a conqueror to the local population.

40|$|AbstractAn {{independent}} set Ic is {{a critical}} independent set if |Ic|−|N(Ic) |≥|J|−|N(J) |, for any independent set J. <b>The</b> critical <b>independence</b> number <b>of</b> a graph is the cardinality of a maximum critical independent set.
