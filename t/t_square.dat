40|$|Selection of {{efficient}} indices is {{very important}} for detecting and measuring random, uniform and clumped distribution patterns of plants in different plant communities. To compare and evaluate indices of dispersion patterns of plants, three stands were selected in Nodushan, Yazd. A (50 m* 100 m) area was selected within each stand for sampling. Sampling was randomly systematicly conducted. Measurements and counts were made at 50 points and (1 and 2 m 2 ) quadrats which were randomly selected along four 100 m transects within each sampling area. Indices of dispersion using quadrate studied in this survey include: Standardized index of Morisita, Morisita's index, Green's index, Dispersion (variance/mean ratio) index, Lloyd's index of patchiness and distance indices of dispersion including Pielou, Hopkines, <b>T</b> <b>square,</b> Eberhardt, Hines, Johnson and Zimer and Holgate indices. Results showed that <b>T</b> <b>square</b> and Holgate indices were more powerful than the other indices for detecting intensity of small-scale and tightly clumped pattern of shrubs because the two indices could distinguish between single individuals and the individuals on the edges of dense and small clumps. Johnson and Zimer index and Standardized index of Morisita (in shrublands with plant cover greater than 5 %) were more efficient than the other indices for determining spatial pattern of these small clumps and single individuals. Among studied indices of dispersion, Green's index had the highest precision and with the exception of this index, distance indices were more precise than the quadrate indices...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} nonlinear oscillatory convection in a horizontal mushy layer rotating about a vertical axis. We analyze the standing and traveling modes of oscillatory convection {{in the form of}} two-dimensional oblique rolls and three-dimensional distorted patterns. Under a near-eutectic approximation and the limit of large far-field temperature, we determine the two- and three-dimensional oscillatory solutions to the weakly nonlinear problem by using a perturbation technique, and the stability of these oscillatory solutions are investigated with respect to arbitrary three-dimensional disturbances. The results of the analyses indicate, in particular, that depending on the range of the values of the parameters, convection in the form of supercritical traveling hexagons can be stable and preferred, provided the value of the rotation parameter <b>T</b> (<b>square</b> root of a Taylor number) is not too small and is below some value, which can depend on the other parameter values.

40|$|Surface {{strain rate}} is best {{observed}} by fitting a strain-rate ellipsoid to the measured movement of a stake network or other collection of surface features, using a least squares procedure.

A demonstration using Ross Ice Shelf data shows that reasonably accurate measurements are obtained from 12 stakes after only 4 days of deformation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} a set of predictor variables which identify perspective orthognathic surgical patients who may be poor surgical risks. The predictive qualities of four MMPI scales, two Bloom Sentence Completion scales, and seven Dental Inventory scales were used to identify presurgical, orthognathic patients who were likely to express postsurgical dissatisfaction. All variables were considered jointly to assess their significance in predicting surgical satisfaction versus dissatisfaction. Subsequently, a minimal set of predictors, which accounted for a significant proportion of the criterion variance, were derived by using factor analysis. A nonrandomized, pretest-posttest design with a one-way, multivariate analysis of variance yielding a Hotelling <b>T</b> <b>square</b> statistic was used. A discriminate analysis of variance was used as a follow-up to the Hotelling <b>T</b> <b>square</b> to note those variables which caused the differences between the means. This study was conducted at a large military teaching and research hospital in Southwest Texas. Patients used in this study were identified during routine dental examinations or were referred by their dentists. Eighty-nine subjects participated in the research project. All subjects were between the ages of 15 and 50 with a mean age of 23. 7. They were all volunteers and received their surgery in the same hospital by the current staff of oral surgeons. All subjects were informed that the psychological evaluation was an integral part of the oral surgery evaluation. Upon admission to the hospital the patient received the scheduled surgery and underwent 8 weeks of routine postoperative care. Prior to being discharged from the hospital the patient was readministered the MMPI, Bloom Sentence Completion, and the Dental Inventory. The 8 -week period was chosen for postoperative testing because patients were medically cleared to resume normal functioning at that time. A statistically significant difference between the four MMPI scores on the results of the orthognathic surgery variable was evident when comparing satisfied versus dissatisfied patients (F = 3. 020, P 0. 028). Additionally, there was a multilinear relationship among the presurgical test and the level of postsurgical satisfaction. Factor analysis rendered a minimal set of predictor variables which proved practical in identifying satisfied from dissatisfied patients. Considering the limitations of the study and the above-mentioned results, it can be concluded that a minimal set of predictor variables could be effective in helping surgeons screen out those patients who have the potential of being poor surgery risks.

40|$|We want to {{establish}} the basic properties of a scale invariant cosmology, that also accounts for the hypothesis of scale invariance of the empty space at large scales. We write the basic analytical properties of the scale invariant cosmological models. The hypothesis of scale invariance of the empty space at large scale brings interesting simplifications in the scale invariant equations for cosmology. There is one new term, depending on the scale factor of the scale invariant cosmology, that opposes to gravity and favours an accelerated expansion. We first consider a zero-density model and find an accelerated expansion, going like <b>t</b> <b>square.</b> In models with matter present, the displacements due to the new term make a significant contribution Omega_l to the energy-density of the Universe, satisfying an equation of the form Omega_m + Omega_k + Omega_l = 1. Unlike the Friedman's models, {{there is a whole}} family of flat models (k= 0) with different density parameters Omega_m smaller than 1. We examine the basic relations between the density and geometrical properties, as well as the conservation laws. The models containing matter have an inflexion point, with first a braking phase followed by an accelerated expansion phase. The scale invariant models have interesting properties and deserve further investigations. Comment: 8 pages, no figure...|$|E

30|$|Next, we {{manually}} select <b>t</b> <b>square</b> or rectangular {{windows in}} the denoised image that are centered on repeating patterns, such as atoms or atomic columns. Separate motifs are selected to represent each of the families of atoms or atomic columns. The coordinates of these windows are used to extract a corresponding set of t motifs from the spatial map of cluster labels obtained from k-means. The spatial abundance of each motif is calculated by scanning the motif across the spatial map of cluster labels, image column by image column and then image row by image row. For a given motif at a given location on the cluster label map, the ‘matching score’ is calculated {{as the number of}} pixels in the motif that match with the current window in the cluster label map. This matching score is divided by the number of pixels in the motif such that the score always ranges from 0 to 1. In the event that two motifs identify the same set of atoms, one of the motifs is removed. Additional motifs may be required to identify those atoms that are not captured by the original set of motifs. One example is the case where drift in the microscope results in distortions in the shapes of atoms in certain sections of the image.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundMany {{different}} surgical {{techniques have}} been described for hepatic parenchymal transection. A retrospective analysis of perioperative mortality, length of hospitalization and blood transfused during operation in two patient groups undergoing liver resection was carried out. In group A, we developed a new technique to resect hepatic parenchyma, using an ultrasonic surgical aspirator with monopolar floating ball cautery, while in group B the crushing clamp technique was used. MethodsIn all, 42 patients with liver resection were enrolled in group A and 107 resections in group B. All patients had hepatic neoplasms except for seven living transplant donors. In group A 43 % of resections involved ≥ 3 segments and 57 % involved ≤ 2 segments; in group B 36. 4 % involved ≥ 3 segments and 63. 6 % consisted of ≤ 2 segments. Statistical analysis utilised independent <b>T</b> <b>square</b> (Pearson Q square) and Mann–Whitney U test. ResultsIn group A 2. 4 % of patients died perioperatively, while 3. 7 % died in group B; mean length of stay (LOS) was 10. 9 days in group B and 8. 0 days in group A. The length of procedure was 7. 5 h in group B and 6. 7 h in group A. In group A, 79 % did not undergo blood transfusion intraoperatively as opposed to 61 % in group B.
