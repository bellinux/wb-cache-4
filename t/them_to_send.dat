5|$|The boom in wool {{prices at}} the time of the Korean War {{inflated}} his family's income, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> O'Halloran to Guildford Grammar School in Perth, the state's capital city. At the age of 14, he won five events in the school championships and led the school to its first state championship in 29 years. He also competed for his school in Australian rules football and rowing.|$|E
5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E

5|$|The union, {{the city}} Labour {{establishment}} and the Bishop of Bristol, Oliver Stratford Tomkins, ignored Stephenson {{and tried to}} work with Bill Smith of the TGWU to resolve the dispute. Learie Constantine continued with {{his support for the}} campaign, meeting with the Lord Mayor of Bristol and Frank Cousins, leader of the Transport and General Workers Union. In addition, he went to the Bristol Omnibus Company's parent, the Transport Holding Company, and persuaded <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> officials to talk with the union. The company chairman told Constantine that racial discrimination was not company policy.|$|E
5|$|Upon Duke Frederick II of Austria's invitation, Béla went to Hainburg an der Donau. However, {{instead of}} helping Béla, the Duke {{forced him to}} cede three {{counties}} (most probably Locsmánd, Pozsony, and Sopron). From Hainburg, Béla fled to Zagreb and sent letters to Pope Gregory IX, Emperor Frederick II, King Louis IX of France and other Western European monarchs, urging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> reinforcements to Hungary. In the hope of military assistance, he even accepted Emperor Frederick II's suzerainty in June. The Pope declared a Crusade against the Mongols, but no reinforcements arrived.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return to haunt him.|$|E

5|$|Later, Danny {{begins to}} date Ana Solis (Maiara Walsh), the fun-loving niece of Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira). Gabrielle and Carlos overhear Angie and Nick {{fighting}} about their secret, which prompts <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> Ana to a modeling academy in New York for her safety. Danny follows Ana without his parents' knowledge. Angie and Gabrielle travel to New York to bring Danny home and Angie confesses her past to Gabrielle in confidence. Patrick tracks Angie back to Fairview, where he hits Nick with his car. While Nick {{is in the}} hospital, Patrick moves into the Bolen home and takes Angie and Danny hostage and forces Angie to build him a second bomb. He plants the bomb inside the house and activates it with a detonator from down the street. However, the bomb {{in the house was}} a decoy; Angie had planted the actual bomb in the detonator. Patrick dies in the explosion and Angie and Nick, still on the run from the FBI, relocate to Atlanta, Georgia while Danny moves to New York to be closer to his grandmother and Ana.|$|E
5|$|On July 22 the North Koreans attacked. The ROK troops {{resisted}} briefly, but {{withdrew from}} {{their positions on}} either side of F Company without communicating their intentions. The withdrawal had {{been a part of the}} plan for reorganizing the line to incorporate the US troops, but F Company expected <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a message before doing so, and did not adjust their defenses to compensate. North Korean troops quickly flanked F Company and began attacking it from the rear. This precipitated an unorganized withdrawal. The swollen stream prevented F Company from crossing to the south side and the 2nd Battalion positions. Walking wounded crowded along the stream where an effort to get them across failed. Two officers and two noncommissioned officers tied a pair of twisted telephone wires about their bodies and tried to swim to the other bank and fasten a line, but each in turn was swept downstream where they floundered ashore on the same bank where they had started. Some men drowned trying to cross the swollen river. The covering fire of a platoon of tanks on the south side held off the North Koreans and allowed most of the survivors to eventually escape. F Company lost 37 men: 6 killed, 10 wounded, and 21 missing.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|Not much {{given to}} {{tenderness}} towards {{the feelings of}} patients of his degree, Mr. Blunt's advice was soon given. 'Yes, he is in for rheumatic fever--won't be about again {{for a long time}} to come. I say, Mistress, all you've got to do is <b>to</b> <b>send</b> in your boy to the Union at Elbury, tell <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> out a cart for him, and take him in as a casual pauper.

5|$|The {{following}} day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in {{the centre of}} the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> messages to the Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain, although Alvarado did not name them in his letters; they confirmed Kaqchikel reports that further out on the Pacific plain was the kingdom called Izcuintepeque in Nahuatl, or Panatacat in Kaqchikel, whose inhabitants were warlike and hostile towards their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|What {{would later}} become the Army of the North started with troops drafted by Juan José Castelli by order of the Primera Junta on 14 June 1810, to fight viceroy Santiago de Liniers, who headed a counter-revolutionary {{movement}} at Córdoba Province. The Junta's order followed its creation documents from 25 May of the same year, which required <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> an expeditionary force to the provinces. It was also {{in response to the}} Junta decree that created the Argentine Army on 29 May, five days after its formation.|$|E
25|$|Mir Jafar himself {{subsequently}} {{clashed with}} the British for much the same reasons as Siraj ud-Daulah had. He conspired with the Dutch East India Company to try to oust the British from Bengal and in 1759 invited <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> troops to aid him. The defeat of the Dutch at the Battle of Chinsurah resulted in Britain moving to have Jafar replaced with his son-in-law, who was considered more favourable to the EIC. One {{of the most important}} long-term effects of the battle was that the British received the diwan – the right to collect taxes in Bengal which was granted in 1765.|$|E
25|$|The {{raids on}} Lae and Salamaua, {{conducted}} by 104 planes from Yorktown and Lexington on 10 March 1942 proved devastating to the Japanese, causing heavy damage to their already depleted amphibious forces by sinking three transports and a minesweeper, {{as well as}} damaging a light cruiser, a large minelayer, three destroyers and a seaplane carrier. More importantly, the attack delayed the Japanese timetable for conquest in the Solomons and prompted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> aircraft carriers to cover the operation. The delay, which also allowed the United States Navy time to marshal its forces, coupled with the dispatch of Japanese carriers led to the confrontation in the Coral Sea.|$|E

25|$|Blacket's {{design for}} the cathedral was {{restricted}} by the foundations that were already in place {{and the existence of}} Perpendicular tracery built to Hume's design in two of the aisle windows. The challenge to Blacket was to create a building which worked within the limitations of scale but still had the imposing quality of a cathedral. Once again, Bishop Broughton's aim was to have a replica of the Magdalen College tower, but Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand had laid the foundation stone in 1842, and his recommendation had been for two towers. Blacket initially designed towers that accommodated the wishes of both Bishops, but he also wrote to a relative in Yorkshire asking <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> drawings of the façade of York Minster.|$|E

Instead of having the query result stored in a temporary table, where the data cannot be updated directly by the user, the dynaset allows the user to view and update the data contained in the dynaset.

25|$|The Country Programme (CP) has two parts: {{food and}} {{nutritional}} assistance {{to people with}} HIV/AIDS, and a school feeding program for all primary schools in the Sahel region. The HIV/AIDS nutrition program aims to better the nutritional recovery {{of those who are}} living with HIV/AIDS and to protect at-risk children and orphans from malnutrition and food security. As part of the school feeding component, the Country Programme's goals are to increase enrollment and attendance in schools in the Sahel region, where enrollment rates are below the national average. Furthermore, the program aims at improving gender parity rates in these schools, by providing girls with high attendance {{in the last two years}} of primary school with take-home rations of cereals as an incentive to households, encouraging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> their girls to school.|$|E
