5|$|Oates {{signed a}} four-year, $3 million {{contract}} extension with the Blues {{prior to the}} 1991–92 NHL season, but after the team signed Brendan Shanahan, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter to significant deals, felt he was underpaid. After playing in his second career All-Star Game, he threatened <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> the team following the all-star break if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a negative reaction from St. Louis fans who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team dealt him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} {{were so bad}} that when Liverpool coach Bob Paisley came onto the pitch to attend to an injured player, Shankly entered as well. He managed to give instructions to his players before he was spotted by the officials and ordered off the field. Ajax player Wim Suurbier was carried off with a damaged ankle midway through the first half. He returned to the pitch, but suffered from a limp. Ajax extended their lead in the 39th minute. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith fouled Cruyff outside the Liverpool penalty area. The subsequent free-kick taken by Frits Soetekouw was not cleared by the Liverpool defence and the ball rebounded to Nuninga, who scored to give Ajax a 3–0 lead. The conditions did not only affect the Liverpool players. Towards {{the end of the}} first half, the referee blew his whistle. Swart, assuming that he had signalled half-time began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> the pitch, was stopped by a steward who pointed out that the match was still ongoing. He re-entered the pitch, received the ball and crossed the ball for Nuninga, who scored to make it 4–0.|$|E
5|$|This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon {{the fall of}} Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson {{when he was on}} eight. Compton appeared ready <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off,</b> but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow off spin to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to bisect the gaps between the fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.|$|E

The judge criticised both sides for allowing the case to reach court, pointing out that total costs were £22million, including £1million for photocopying.

25|$|He was {{involved}} in a bizarre run-out with Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the third Test against New Zealand in 2006. Morton drove the ball to mid-on where Daniel Vettori was fielding and ran to the non striker end. Chanderpaul, at the other end, initially took a few steps down the wicket but then turned {{and went back to the}} non-striker's end. Morton believed he was out, and, furious at his captain, began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off.</b> However, following a call to the third umpire, it was decided that Morton had grounded his bat at the non-striker's end just before Chanderpaul, and hence was safe and that Chanderpaul was out. Video evidence suggests that the umpire's decision was wrong: although Morton made his ground first, he then left it before the run-out was made, so he should have been the one dismissed.|$|E

25|$|On {{the fourth}} day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua during India's tour of West Indies, 2006, Dhoni's flick off Dave Mohammed to the midwicket region was caught by Daren Ganga. As the batsman started to walk back, captain Dravid {{declared}} the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, {{the captain of the}} West Indies side, Brian Lara, wanted Dhoni <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and Lara's temper was on display with finger wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire Asad Rauf. Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara's action was criticised by the commentators and former players. Lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions but he was not fined.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, {{third baseman}} Anthony Rendon hit his first career grand slam off Braves pitcher Williams Pérez, putting the Nationals on top {{in a game}} {{they went on to}} win 9–7. On September 9, rookie center fielder Trea Turner posted his first multi-homer game, hitting a two-run shot {{followed}} by a solo home run <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> the division rival Philadelphia Phillies 5–4. Latos, making his first start for the Nationals in a September 12 game against the Mets, became the first Nationals pitcher since 2014 to hit a home run, contributing in an 8–1 victory over New York with his solo home run off Mets starter Rafael Montero. In the Nationals' final game of the season against their New York rivals on September 14, a 1–0 win, second baseman Daniel Murphy went 1-for-2 with a walk, thereby recording at least one hit in every game he played against the team he was with during the previous season. He became the first National League player in 12 years to hit in every game of a season series of at least 19 games and set a record for the longest single-season hitting streak against a previous-year team dating back to the creation of divisions in the major leagues in 1969.|$|E

Later on, Piro {{encounters}} Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered {{the next time they}} meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy {{to get rid of all}} cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed, {{from the first}} ball he received, by Charlie Macartney for a duck. However, the match was a low-scoring one on a pitch which made batting difficult, and Australia left England needing 105 to win. The task was not easy in the conditions, but Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out. He scored quickly off all the bowlers and England passed the target without losing a wicket. This innings meant that he had scored 919 runs {{before the end of}} May, but he failed to emulate W. G. Grace's {{achievement}} of scoring 1,000 runs in May when Nottinghamshire batted throughout the day when Surrey played them on 31 May. England lost the second Test by nine wickets, their team much changed to the bafflement of critics and spectators, and Hobbs scored just 19 and 9. The home side also lost the third Test. Hobbs scored 12 and 30, the latter the highest score of the innings, but was involved in controversy in the first innings when he appeared to change his mind when about <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>off</b> after apparently hitting his own wicket. The umpire ruled him not out, to the fury of the Australians who loudly protested for some time. Hobbs was out to a very straightforward delivery almost immediately after; some critics, including the Australian captain, believed he allowed himself to be dismissed because he thought the umpire was wrong, but Hobbs later wrote that the incident unsettled him and he lost concentration.|$|E
