5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal. It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E
25|$|The gestural theory states <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> was a {{relatively}} late development, evolving by degrees from a system that was originally gestural.|$|E
25|$|J. L. Austin is {{associated}} with the view <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality to which it is applied through speech acts.|$|E
5000|$|Spasmodic dysphonia: A {{dystonia}} of {{the vocal}} cords. The complications surrounding {{this form of}} dystonia are speech related and can cause symptoms such as <b>speech</b> <b>that</b> wavers, <b>speech</b> <b>that</b> sounds like a whisper, or <b>speech</b> <b>that</b> is hesitant.|$|R

5000|$|The court drew a sharp {{distinction}} between <b>speech</b> <b>that</b> meets the legal definition of [...] "obscene" [...] and <b>speech</b> <b>that</b> is [...] "indecent" [...] (sexually charged but not {{rising to the}} level of [...] "obscene"). The court held <b>that</b> obscene <b>speech</b> could be restricted, but <b>that</b> merely indecent <b>speech</b> was protected by the First Amendment. The court also recognized a real need for governmental interest in shielding children from <b>speech</b> <b>that</b> could be obscene to minors, but not for adults. However, the court stressed that these limitations must be limited so they can distinguish what is and what is not restricted, carefully protecting the rights of adults to receive protected <b>speech,</b> even if <b>that</b> protected <b>speech</b> is indecent.|$|R
25|$|He {{concluded}} in <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> {{that as a}} cumulative effect of all these atrocities, the peaceful voice of the Tamils is now drowned in the echo of the gun; referring to the rebel LTTE's terrorism.|$|E
25|$|The sensory {{part of a}} neurocomputational {{model of}} speech {{processing}} starts with an acoustic signal of a speech item (acoustic speech signal), generates an auditory representation for that signal and activates a phonemic representations for <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> item.|$|E
25|$|Verbal Comprehension is {{a fairly}} complex process, {{and it is not}} fully understood. From various studies and experiments, it has been found that the {{superior}} temporal sulcus activates when hearing human speech, and <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> processing seems to occur within Wernicke's area.|$|E

On September 30, 2008 he issued a statement and resigned {{as a result of the}} incident.|$|E
25|$|During {{imitation}} the DIVA {{model is}} also capable of tuning the synaptic projections from speech sound map to somatosensory target region map, since each new imitation attempt produces a new {{articulation of the}} speech item and thus produces a somatosensory state pattern which {{is associated with the}} phonemic representation of <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> item.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007 {{landmark}} {{free speech}} case Morse v. Frederick, Alito joined Roberts' majority decision <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also {{warned that the}} ruling must be circumscribed {{that it does not}} interfere with political speech, such as the discussion of the medical marijuana debate.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram, a {{predefined}} threshold τ {{can be used to}} distinguish between intentional and unintentional attacks. If the extracted watermark has a BER that is higher than τ, it can be inferred <b>that</b> the <b>speech</b> signal has been modified maliciously. Otherwise, it can be inferred <b>that</b> the <b>speech</b> signal has been modified accidentally.|$|R
60|$|Yes, I know it; and by old {{experience}} I know <b>that</b> <b>speeches</b> {{and documents}} and public meetings are a pretty poor and lame way of accomplishing it. Last year I proposed a sane way--one which I had practiced with success {{for a quarter}} of a century--but I wasn't expecting it to get any attention, and it didn't.|$|R
25|$|The {{interim report}} {{highlighted}} {{a number of}} core issues: <b>that</b> <b>speech,</b> language and communication are not only essential life skills but fundamental human rights; that early identification of problems and intervention is important to avoid social problems later on; and that {{the current system of}} treatment is patchy, i.e. {{there is a need for}} services to be continually provided for children and families from an early age.|$|E
25|$|After Phaedrus {{concedes that}} this speech was {{certainly}} {{better than any}} Lysias could compose, they begin {{a discussion of the}} nature and uses of rhetoric itself. After showing <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> making itself isn't something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks what distinguishes good from bad writing, and they take this up.|$|E
25|$|Initially, most profanity was bleeped, {{but later}} episodes were bleeped for {{explicit}} language, sometimes {{to such an}} extent <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> became incomprehensible. In addition, nudity, the partial exposure of breasts or buttocks as well as the middle finger is pixelated. After longtime producer Richard Dominick left, the show reverted to the traditional style of bleeping, which remains in place today. A The New York Times report from April 1998 found that each episode had about 85 to 130 bleeps.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{attack was}} carried out {{when he was about}} to address a public meeting in Liaquat Bagh Rawalpindi, a stray bullet killed a youth {{standing}} close to Wali Khan on the stage. Convinced that Bhutto had orchestrated the attacks with the collusion of Khan's old rival Abdul Qayyum Khan, and after one particularly narrow escape, he warned Bhutto {{on the floor of the}} National Assembly that he would trade bullet for bullet with Bhutto, after <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> Bhutto's trips to the North-West Frontier Province were heavily guarded.|$|E
25|$|For speech perception, {{the model}} starts with an {{external}} acoustic signal (e.g. produced by an external speaker). This signal is preprocessed, passes the auditory map, {{and leads to}} an activation pattern for each syllable or word {{on the level of}} the auditory-phonetic processing module (ES: external signal, see Fig. 5). The ventral path of speech perception (see Hickok and Poeppel 2007) would directly activate a lexical item, but is not implemented in ACT. Rather, in ACT the activation of a phonemic state occurs via the phonemic map and thus may lead to a coactivation of motor representations for <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> item (i.e. dorsal pathway of speech perception; ibid.).|$|E
25|$|Souter also rebuked the {{majority}} for accepting the incorrect view that any statement {{made by a}} public employee constitutes, or should be treated as, the government’s own speech, because such a view is valid only when a public employee is hired to promote a particular policy by communicating a particular message. He further disagreed with {{the majority}}’s argument for limiting the Pickering doctrine, which held that the First Amendment protections were unnecessary {{in light of the}} existence of a comprehensive set of state and federal statutes that protected government whistle-blowers. Souter noted <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> that addressed official wrongdoing may well be unprotected under existing statutory protections (e.g., the teacher in Givhan would not qualify as a whistle-blower).|$|E

25|$|In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson {{began his}} {{re-election}} campaign. Eugene McCarthy ran against {{him for the}} nomination on an anti-war platform. McCarthy did not win the first primary election in New Hampshire, but he did surprisingly well against an incumbent. The resulting blow to the Johnson campaign, taken together with other factors, led the President to make a surprise announcement in a March 31 televised speech that he was {{pulling out of the}} race. He also announced the initiation of the Paris Peace Negotiations with Vietnam in <b>that</b> <b>speech.</b> Then, on August 4, 1969, U.S. representative Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese representative Xuan Thuy began secret peace negotiations at the apartment of French intermediary Jean Sainteny in Paris.|$|E
25|$|He was {{nominated}} as Prime Minister by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) on 25 August 2004, after Péter Medgyessy resigned {{due to a}} conflict with the Socialist Party's coalition partner. Gyurcsány was elected Prime Minister on 29 September 2004 in a parliamentary vote (197 yes votes, 12 no votes, {{with most of the}} opposition in Parliament not voting). He led his coalition to victory in the 2006 parliamentary election, securing another term as Prime Minister. His first rise to power {{was the result of a}} coalition conflict. His legitimacy was permanently questioned by opposition parties based on his withholding of information about the actual budget deficit in his 2006 re-election campaign. He was also criticised for using derogatory terms for his own country in his speech in Balatonőszöd. After <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> became public, demonstrations started on the streets of Budapest where many people were injured, both demonstrators and policemen.|$|E
25|$|The Nuremberg Trials {{employed}} four official languages: English, German, French, and Russian. In {{order to}} address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals {{and history of the}} interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate <b>that</b> <b>speech</b> into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard {{over the course of the}} proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.|$|E
