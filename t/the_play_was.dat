50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by a mixing of genres: Greek characters, a shipwreck leaning towards tragedy, and social commentary. However, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> essentially a comedy with its confusion of sentiments, exchange of power between masters and valets, and finally the appearance of Arlequin.|$|R
5|$|Savage {{incorporated}} gender reversal for {{the actors}} cast {{to portray the}} male and female roles. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> successful and its run was extended for an additional month post its intended wrap date.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> {{involves}} a significant reworking {{of the source}} material. Rather than present {{the story in the}} first-person narrative as the original novel did, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> presented as a reading of Boone's own writing, read aloud in segments by his teacher.

Doris Nolan, in her Broadway debut, received positive criticism for her portrayal of the lead role. Several regional productions followed.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{made with}} {{electronic}} video cameras, although recorded onto film rather than tape.

Although extensive searches have been made by the BBC, only partial audio recordings of four songs sung by Dylan survive.|$|E
