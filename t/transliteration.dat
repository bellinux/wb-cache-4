5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel's second son Qedar. Though the tribal name is Arabic, it was first transcribed in Assyrian (8th century BCE) and Aramaic (6th century BCE), as the Arabic alphabet had not yet been developed. In the Mareshah onomasticon, the Qedarites are listed as an ethnic group whose name in Aramaic <b>transliteration</b> is QDRYN.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that in the {{original}} Akkadian, Ú-a-a-te is used to refer to the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda). The latter is also sometimes referred to as Ia-u-ta- and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written Ú-a-a-te. The <b>transliteration</b> of the original Akkadian into English is highly unstable and only some of the alternate spellings appear in this article.|$|E
50|$|Although {{official}} <b>transliterations,</b> {{done by the}} YIVO Institute, of Yiddish {{words into}} English exist, many <b>transliterations</b> are commonly performed on a nonstandard basis. Alternate <b>transliterations</b> of the Yiddish term for matzah ball, in the singular, include: knaidl, knaidel, kneidl, and kneidel. <b>Transliterations</b> in the plural include: knaidels, knaidlach, knaidelach, kneidels, kneidlach, kneidelach, kneydls, kneydels, and kneydlach.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{learning}} to find English to Chinese <b>transliterations</b> on the Web. In our approach, proper nouns are expanded into new queries aimed at maximizing the probability of retrieving <b>transliterations</b> from existing search engines. The method involves learning the sublexical relationships between names and their <b>transliterations.</b> At run-time, a given name is automatically extended into queries with relevant morphemes, and <b>transliterations</b> in the returned search snippets are extracted and ranked. We present a new system, TermMine, that applies the method to find <b>transliterations</b> of a given name. Evaluation {{on a list of}} 500 proper names shows that the method achieves high precision and recall, and outperforms commercial machine translation systems. ...|$|R
30|$|In an {{interesting}} {{study of the}} areal competition of various neologisms {{in a number of}} different Chinese varieties and of the factors determining their long-term survival, T’sou and You 邹嘉彦,游汝杰 (2003) found that it was not possible to make a general statement as to whether <b>transliterations</b> or calques were more competitive. In fact, this finding in itself is very telling. All other things being equal, one would expect calques to have a better chance of survival than <b>transliterations</b> in Chinese as they exhibit the aforementioned correspondence between phonemic and morphemic boundaries. Thus, it is hardly surprising that many of the <b>transliterations</b> borrowed 100 [*]years ago in the midst of the political, social, and linguistic upheaval surrounding the May Fourth Movement were ousted relatively quickly by calques or new coinages, nor is it surprising that even some <b>transliterations</b> borrowed a mere 40 or 50 [*]years ago have suffered the same fate. Clearly, however, this is no longer the typical pattern. Jin 金其斌 (2005 : 9) mentions the recent rise in popularity of <b>transliterations</b> vis-à-vis calques, and Guo 郭鸿杰 (2002 b: 3), too, comments on this modern phenomenon, citing some examples of well-established calques and new coinages that have been replaced by more popular <b>transliterations.</b> It seems as though Chinese society may be far more ready to accept <b>transliterations</b> now than it was a century or even a few decades ago.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script, which {{was used in the}} Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied. ISO 15919 is an international standard for the <b>transliteration</b> of Tamil and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. Tamil can be transliterated into English by using ISO 15919, since English language uses the Latin script for writing.|$|E
5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic <b>transliteration</b> of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E
5|$|Study of {{the decree}} was {{already under way}} when the first full {{translation}} of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the <b>transliteration</b> of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three {{versions of the same}} text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic (Thomas Young, 1814); and that, in addition to being used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).|$|E

Kublai Khan eventually honored him with the title of Prince of Fu lin (Chinese: 拂菻王; Fú lǐn wáng). His biography in the History of Yuan lists his children by their Chinese names, which are similar to the Christian names Elias (Ye-li-ah), Luke (Lu-ko), and Antony (An-tun), with a daughter named A-na-si-sz.|$|E
5|$|The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the {{original}} Sanskrit, {{the name is}} written as Tulasīdāsa. Using the Hunterian <b>transliteration</b> system, it is written as Tulsidas or Tulsīdās reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are {{an aspect of the}} Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Tulasī, which is an Indian variety of the basil plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means slave or servant and by extension, devotee. Tulsidas, which means a servant of the plant Tulsi.|$|E
