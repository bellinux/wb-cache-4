50|$|Being {{a member}} of the Anthidiini tribe of megachilid bees, A. manicatum engages in highly {{elaborate}} nesting behavior. These bees construct their nests in preexisting cavities, using the trichomes of wooly plants. Female A. manicatum use their mandibles, which are sharply toothed, to remove trichomes from the stems and leaves of various plants. They then roll up the trichomes into a ball and bring them to a preexisting cavity. Inside the cavity, the bees fashion the trichome ball into cells, where they deposit an egg as well as a provisioning mass consisting of nectar and pollen. The female creates several cells in a cavity. Once finished, she seals the entrance to the cavity with a <b>terminal</b> <b>plug,</b> which consists of inorganic and organic materials that she brings to the nest.|$|E
5000|$|The nest of O. bicornis {{consists}} of an array of partitioned cylindrical cells in holes in wood or reed tubes. These bees accept a diverse range of pre-existing cavities as nest sites. The cells are arranged linearly within a narrow tube. If the internal diameter of the tube exceeds 12 mm, then this linear arrangement may be forced into two rows instead of one. The length of each cell can vary from 10 to 21 mm. The inner sides of the partitions are rough and convex, while the outer sides are smooth and concave. Between the cells and the <b>terminal</b> <b>plug</b> is a space known as the [...] The vestibule acts {{as a form of}} protection against volatile environmental conditions. The bees whose nests are exposed to the sun and heat build vestibules more frequently. The material used to build the nests is mud mixed with their mandibles, but the sides of the tunnel in which the nests are located are usually not lined with mud, with the exception of some irregularly arranged nests. Females construct around six cells per nest on average; however, larger females construct more cells than smaller ones. When it is time for females to lay their eggs, they add pollen to each brood cell and lay one egg in each cell next to the pollen. The sequence of nesting behavior is: cell construction, provisioning, egg-laying, and sealing the cell.Cells containing females are typically larger than those containing males, due to the sexual dimorphism of the species. Additionally, cells containing females are situated towards the back of the nest, while those with males are closer to the nest entrance. Because of this, male offspring leave the nest sooner than females. Due to the linear arrangement of cells in the nest, the youngest bee leaves earlier than older ones.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper reports an {{experimental}} study {{to understand the}} evaporation mechanism of a partially wetting isolated liquid plug (methanol) of length L moving inside a long, dry, horizontal circular glass capillary tube (ID = 1. 5 mm). The plug (with specified range of non-dimensional L/D ratios) is pushed from rest by controlled injection of air from one side, till a quasi-steady <b>terminal</b> <b>plug</b> velocity is achieved in the adiabatic section (non-heated length) of the capillary tube. Under such conditions, the drainage of thin-film occurring at the receding interface and its subsequent dewetting is well predicted by existing literature. The plug is then allowed {{to move through the}} heated section maintained at constant wall temperature (lesser than the saturation temperature of methanol). The drained film now starts evaporating rapidly, drastically affecting the bulk transport behavior. High resolution videography, coupled with laser confocal microscopy provides vital bulk as well as local information, including time-varying plug length, film thickness and local dewetting behavior near the contact line. Experimental results obtained for different wall temperatures and different initial L/D ratios of liquid plug suggests that the Taylor’s law for predicting drainage characteristics under adiabatic flow conditions is valid, even for cases where there is a continuous evaporation of thin-film. The study thus provides a framework for modeling evaporative flux based on simple hydrodynamic theory of film drainage...|$|E
40|$|Cells of Methanothrix concilii do {{not possess}} rigid, shape-forming cell walls; they obtain their {{cellular}} form from the portions of the sheath and spacer plugs which enclose them. Electron microscopy has shown that cell division proceeds by the ingrowth of spacer plugs, like the closing of a camera iris, from select regions of the sheath; this process forces the cells to split in two. Therefore, each spacer plug which traverses the filament of cells is a completed division annulus. Spacer plugs are two-layered structures; one layer is an assembly of fine concentric rings and {{is the first to}} be laid down during the division ingrowth. The second layer consists of larger, raised, concentric ribbons which progressively follow the advance of the first layer during division. Although cells within the filament are typically 2. 52 ̆ 0023 ̆bcm long, new daughter cells are ca. 1. 02 ̆ 0023 ̆bcm and can grow to ca. 4. 02 ̆ 0023 ̆bcm before division begins. Frequently, a developing spacer plug partitions a cell so that one daughter is a small, nonreplicating unit of protoplasm sandwiched between two completed plugs; eventually, this protoplasmic unit dies leaving a void in the chain of cells. The filament is susceptible to breakage at this juncture. In this instance, each of the two "void" plugs becomes a new <b>terminal</b> <b>plug</b> for the new ends of the split filament. This type of replication requires both cell division and filament splitting, and the series of structural events which are involved present a new form of prokaryotic division.

40|$|In the testes of West African dwarf goats, {{modified}} Sertoli cells {{comprise the}} {{major component of}} the terminal segment epithelium.

Cell attachment devices present include rudimentary desmosomes and occasional multiple contacts of opposing plasma membranes, interrupted by segments of slightly expanded intercellular space. A few generative cells {{are present in the}} proximal zone of the epithelium, but their development appears to terminate as early spermatids which hang loosely on the luminal surface. The middle zone epithelium comprises vacuolated cells lying among other cells containing abundant microtubules in their subapical cytoplasm.

40|$|By light microscopy, Methanospirillum hungatei GP 1 stains gram {{positive}} at {{the terminal}} ends of each multicellular filament and gram negative at all regions in between. This phenomenon was studied further by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of Gram-stained cells, using a platinum compound to replace Gram's iodine (J. A. Davies, G. K. Anderson, T. J. Beveridge, and H. C. Clark, J. Bacteriol. 156 : 837 - 845, 1983). Crystal violet-platinum precipitates {{could be found}} only in the terminal cells of each filament, which suggested that the multilamellar plugs at the filament ends were involved with stain penetration. When sheaths were isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-dithiothreitol treatment, the end plugs could be ejected and their layers could be separated from one another by 0. 1 M NaOH treatment. Each plug consisted {{of at least three}} individual layers; two were particulate and possessed 14. 0 -nm particles hexagonally arranged on their surfaces with a spacing of a = b = 18. 0 nm, whereas the other was a netting of 12. 5 -nm holes with spacings and symmetry identical to those of the particulate layers. Optical diffraction and computer image reconstruction were used to clarify the structures of each layer in an intact plug and to provide a high-resolution image of their interdigitated structures. The holes through this composite were three to six times larger than those through the sheath.

40|$|A four-helix bundle is a well-characterized motif {{often used}} as a target for {{designed}} pharmaceutical therapeutics and nutritional supplements. Recently, we discovered a new structural complexity within this motif created by a disulphide bridge in the long-chain helical bundle cytokine epileptic When oxidized, leptin contains a disulphide bridge creating a covalent-loop through which part of the polypeptide chain is threaded (as seen in knotted proteins). We explored whether other proteins contain a similar intriguing knot-like structure as in leptin and discovered 11 structurally homologous proteins in the PDB. We call this new helical family class the Pierced Lasso Bundle (PLB) and the knot-like threaded structural motif a Pierced Lasso (PL). In the current study, we use structure-based simulation to investigate the threading/folding mechanisms for all the PLBs along with three unthreaded homologs as the covalent loop (or lasso) in leptin is important in folding dynamics and activity. We find {{that the presence of}} a small covalent loop leads to a mechanism where structural elements slipknot to thread through the covalent loop. Larger loops use a piercing mechanism where the free <b>terminal</b> <b>plugs</b> through the covalent loop. Remarkably, the position of the loop as well as its size influences the native state dynamics, which can impact receptor binding and biological activity. This previously unrecognized complexity of knot-like proteins within the helical bundle family comprises a completely new class within the knot family, and the hidden complexity we unraveled in the PLBs is expected to be found in other protein structures outside the four-helix bundles. The insights gained here provide critical new elements for future investigation of this emerging class of proteins, where function and the energetic landscape can be controlled by hidden topology, and should be take into account in ab initio predictions of newly identified protein targets...|$|R

Electron microscopy of negatively stained whole mounts revealed a flagellar filament diameter of approximately 10 nm. Flagellar filaments were isolated from either culture fluid or concentrated cell suspensions that were subjected to shearing. Flagellar filaments were sensitive to treatment with both Triton X- 100 and Triton X- 114 at concentrations as low as 0. 1 % (vol/vol). The filaments of both strains were composed of two flagellins of Mr 24, 000 and 25, 000. However, variations in trace element composition of the medium resulted in the production of a third flagellin in strain JF 1. This additional flagellin appeared as a ladderlike smear on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacylamide gels with a center of intensity of Mr 35, 000 and cross-reacted with antisera produced from filaments containing only the Mr- 24, 000 and - 25, 000 flagellins. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, all flagellins stained by the thymol-sulfuric acid and Alcian blue methods, suggesting that they were glycosylated. This was further supported by chemical deglycosylation of the strain JF 1 flagellins, which resulted in a reduction in their apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacylamide gels.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the testes of 32 bovine embryos with {{different}} crown-rump length (2. 5 - 90 cm CRL) and of 15 sexually mature bulls (Deutsches Fleckvieh) were investigated using light- and electron microscope {{as well as}} glycohistochemical and immunohistochemical methods. The gestation period was divided into 3 stages; early, mid, and late gestation. Developmental changes in the testicular morphogenesis were therefore analyzed in details during these phases. Generally, embryonic development of bovine testis involves the same mechanism described in other mammals. At {{the first stage of}} this study (2. 5 cm CRL/ 43 dpc), the anlage of the testes protruded to the coelomic cavity as paired bean-shaped structures {{on either side of the}} dorsal mesentery medial to the mesonephros. It consists of primitive testicular cords, interstitium, and rete testis blastema. Proceeding with fetal age, these basic testicular structures are further differentiated. The tunica albuginea is separated into two layers: an outer fibrous layer (tunica fibrosa) with some mesenchymal cells, numerous fibroblast, and much fibrous content and an inner cellular layer with several blood vessels (tunica vasculosa). The testicular cords are surrounded by a marked basal lamina and peritubular cells and lined by two types of cells: a large number of dark polygonal cells with irregular nuclei, pre-Sertoli cells and small number of large light round cells with relatively round nuclei, the prespermatogonia. The average number of the germ cells per cross section of cord increases, particularly form 3. 5 to 14 cm CRL, resulting in a germ cell maximum at the end of this stage (14 cm CRL). Although most of the germ cells are located toward the periphery of the cord, some are also found in the center. Pre-Sertoli cells form a complete layer at the periphery of the cords. Generally, these cells are irregular in shape and numerous but considerably smaller than the germ cells. Unlike prespermatogonia, mitotic figures are seen in pre-Sertoli cells during the whole embryonic life. As a consequence of the expansion in the interstitium, the seminiferous cords are progressively separated from each other. The testicular interstitium is rapidly differentiated and is composed of several islets or clusters of polygonal Leydig cells, peritubular flattened cells surrounding the testicular cords, connective tissue cells, and numerous blood vessels. In the present study, fetal Leydig cells were first recognized at 3. 5 cm CRL. Thereafter, the average number of these cells is rapidly increased to attain their maximum with the end of the first gestation period (14 cm CRL). This generation of Leydig cells however dedifferentiates progressively with developmental age. A continuous system of basal lamina joins the testicular cords with rete strands from 10 cm CRL and onwards. This system establishes the first connection between these two testicular components via ill-developed uncanalized straight tubules (tubuli recti). Rete testis channels are lined by simple layer of cuboidal epithelium with round nuclei occupying most of the cytoplasm and enclosed by well-defined basal lamina. The adult bovine testis is enclosed by a connective tissue capsule, tunica albuginea, composed predominantly of collagen fibers and few elastic fibers. Most of the testicular parenchyma is made up of the convoluted seminiferous tubules (tubuli seminiferi contorti), two-ended convoluted loops, with both ends opening into the rete testis via specialized terminal segments. The seminiferous tubules of sexually mature bulls are enclosed by a distinct lamina propria and are lined by two cell populations, non-proliferating Sertoli cells and highly proliferating spermatogenic cells. The bovine lamina propria consists of basal lamina, collagen and elastic fibers, and 3 - 5 layers of partially overlapping myofibroblasts. Additionally, fibrocytes, collagen fibrils, and fibroblasts-like cells form the outermost border of the tubulus. Sertoli cells are easily identifiable elements of the seminiferous epithelium. Adult Sertoli cells are large irregularly shaped cells with their broad bases resting on the basal lamina while the remaining cytoplasmic processes extend upward to the tubular lumen. They are characterized by round or oval euchromatin-rich nuclei situating in the basal portion near the basal lamina of the seminiferous tubules. Adult bovine germ cells are present in four morphologically different groups, i. e., spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa. The seminiferous cycle stages are identified using changes in the germ cell nuclei as well as location and shape of spermatids. According to this method, eight stages are defined in the seminiferous epithelium of bovine. The interstitial or intertubular tissue of adult bovine testis consists of Leydig cells, macrophages, scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells, and contains numerous blood and lymph vessels. Not all Leydig cells have contact to blood or lymph capillaries. The excurrent duct system of the adult bovine testis consists of terminal segment of the convoluted seminiferous tubules, straight tubules, and rete testis. The terminal segment can be further subdivided into a proximal (transitional) region, middle portion, and distal part (<b>terminal</b> <b>plug).</b> The proximal region is lined by typical Sertoli cells while the last two parts are lined by modified Sertoli cells. The tubulus rectus of adult bovine testis is composed of three morphologically different regions: a proximal cup-shaped region, a middle narrow stalk, and a distal festooned portion. The rete testis is a complicated centrally positioned meshwork of intercommunicating channels that lies within the mediastinum testis parallel to the long axis of epididymis. The simple cuboidal epithelium of straight tubules and rete testis is shown to contain some lymphocytes and macrophages. The cellular distribution of glycoconjugates within the fetal and adult bovine testis was investigated using thirteen (ConA, PSA, LCA, PNA, GSA-I, ECA, DBA, SBA, HPA, VVA, WGA, UEA-I, LTA) different fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated lectins. In fetal testes, detection of sugar moieties by lectins was carried out on Bouin õ s-fixed paraffin-embedded sections while in adult it was performed on both Bouin õ s-fixed paraffin-embedded and acetone-fixed frozen sections. Only five lectins (PSA, PNA, GSA-I, DBA, WGA) showed a positive reaction in the embryonic testes. PNA, GSA-I, DBA, and WGA were detected in the germ cells whereas PSA, DBA and WGA labeled the fetal Leydig cells. None of the lectins used was observed in the pre-Sertoli cells. Further on, some lectins were seen in tunica albuginea (PSA, PNA, GSA-I, WGA), basal lamina of testicular cords (PSA, WGA), interstitial blood vessels (PSA, GSA-I, WGA), mediastinum testis (PSA, PNA, WGA) and rete testis epithelium (PNA). In adult animals, spermatogonia and spermatocytes were positively stained with PSA, LCA, DBA, SBA, and VVA. All the lectins investigated except that of the fucose-binding lectin (UEA-I and LTA) were definitely detected in the acrosome of round and elongated spermatids. These results indicate a role for carbohydrates in spermiogenesis. Apical Sertoli cells processes and Leydig cells were weakly stained with PSA and LCA as well. DBA binding sites were also seen in the Leydig cells. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using the Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase Complex (ABC) method for localization of fibroblast growth factor- 1 (FGF- 1), fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2), S- 100, laminin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (á -SMA), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), connexin 43 (Cx 43), CD 4, CD 8, CD 68, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and galactosyltransferase (GalTase) in the bovine testis. The expression of FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 was further investigated in the adult bovine testis using in situ hybridization and PCR. Immunohistochemically, FGF- 1 was seen in the Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, endothelium of the blood vessels, and epithelium of straight tubules and rete testis of fetal and adult testis. It was additionally detected in spermatogonia and spermatids of sexual mature animals. FGF- 2 exhibited a striking positive reaction in fetal (from 6 to 30 cm CRL) and adult Leydig cells. Moreover, it showed marked reaction in the endothelium of blood vessels and in the epithelium of tubulus rectus and rete testis. FGF- 2 was also localized in some spermatogonia, and myofibroblasts. By means of in situ hybridization, FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 mRNA were found in Leydig and Sertoli cells as well as in the modified Sertoli cells of the terminal segment. FGF- 1 transcripts were additionally recognized in the straight tubules and rete testis epithelium. Distinct S 100 immunostaining was observed in the Sertoli cells, endothelium of blood vessels and in the rete testis epithelium of fetal and adult testis. Laminin was localized to the basal lamina of seminiferous tubules, blood vessels, myofibroblasts, and rete testis. Although á -SMA was detected in smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels, no immunoreactivity was seen in the peritubular cells during the whole gestation period. The myofibroblasts surrounding the seminiferous tubules and rete testis showed intense positive reaction for á -SMA in the adult testis. VEGF was detected in the acrosomes of the elongating spermatids. Connexin 43 was localized to gap junctions between Leydig cells in the fetal and adult life as well as to the seminiferous epithelium apical to spermatogonia and basal to spermatocytes, a position correlating with Sertoli-Sertoli cell junctions. The detection of cells positive for CD 4, CD 8, CD 68 within the adult testis interstitium clearly indicate the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages within this testicular compartment. GalTase showed striking positive reaction in the Golgi complex of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and some spermatocytes as well as at the cell membrane of elongating spermatids and in the simple cuboidal epithelium of rete testis. ACE positive reaction was found in the prespermatogonia (only at 6 - 10 cm CRL) and in fetal and adult testicular blood vessels. The functional significance of these immunocytochemically-demonstrated proteins is discussed...|$|E

The empirical work consists of case studies I have accomplished in two different Norwegian companies. The first is a public transport information provider called Trafikanten. I have studied the services they provide, the service for wireless terminals in particular, and also cooperated with a student group that studied their wireless service. The second company, where I did some research, was a consultancy firm called Ementor. Here I both accomplished an interview and I worked there for nine weeks during the summer of 2000. The theoretical part is founded in my literature studies. The bibliography reflects what I have read during my work with the thesis. By reading a combination of articles, books and sites on the Internet I have established a foundation upon which I have based my discussions throughout the thesis. Through my research I wanted to find out if there were any differences between developing traditional systems and wireless services. In short, I found that the situation in which services for fixed <b>plug</b> <b>terminals</b> and wireless terminals are used, differs in such an extent that one have to think different when developing these services. So far the development of systems for wireless terminals is a very immature area and no standard method of how to develop such systems is established. I highlight the fact that context is a critical aspect when it comes to developing new services...|$|R
