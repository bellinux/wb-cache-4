50|$|During the 1872 presidential campaign, pro-Grant demonstrators {{took part}} in street fights in October against pro-Horace Greeley demonstrators. Weapons from the {{battalion}} armory were brought out, but Harlan and other leaders of the battalion were among those who quelled the violence. The Ohio Adjutant-General found that no officers or men from the battalion {{took part in}} breaking into the armory or using the guns unlawfully, and the battalion was not punished. Harlan served as colonel {{for four or five}} years, and he continued to be referred to with the <b>title</b> <b>Colonel</b> {{for the rest of his}} life. Later in life this caused some difficulty, as his military service was not during the Civil War or another war, and it was implied that he had purposely traveled to England to avoid the war and he did not deserve the title. The battalion was disbanded in December 1874 and Harlan was held responsible for guns missing from the armory since the 1872 violence.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few weeks}} before the start of World War I, the 2nd Battalion of the Argylls and the Band were {{stationed}} at Fort George in North-East Scotland, nine miles from Inverness. It was here that Ricketts composed his most famous march, [...] "Colonel Bogey". While there are several speculations of how the march was begun, the most accepted is probably from a note written by Ricketts’ widow to the publishers in 1958.“While playing golf on the Fort George course, one of the members whistled the first two notes (B flat and G) instead of calling ‘Fore!’, and with impish spontaneity was answered by my husband with the next few notes. There was little sauntering—Moray Firth’s stiff breezes encouraged a good crisp stride. These little scraps of whistling appeared to ‘catch on’ with the golfers, and from that beginning the Quick March was built up.” Was the original whistler the colonel? We’ll probably never know for certain, but the <b>title</b> <b>Colonel</b> Bogey gives us a clue.Shortly after hostilities began in August, the adult musicians of most line bands were pressed into service as stretcher bearers and medical orderlies. Ricketts and the Band Boys of the Argylls were posted to the 3rd Battalion (Reserve) in Edinburgh for the duration. During the war Ricketts wrote several marches dedicated to the fighting forces: [...] "The Great Little Army" [...] (1916), [...] "On The Quarter Deck," [...] "The Middy," [...] and [...] "The Voice of the Guns" [...] (1917), and [...] "The Vanished Army" [...] (1919) which was subtitled [...] "They Never Die". By {{the end of the war}} the Band Boys had matured into a group considered by many to be the finest regimental band in the British Army. Ricketts was given the unusual honour of being Mentioned in Despatches for Commendable Service.|$|E
