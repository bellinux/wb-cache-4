Louisa was surprisingly booked for the runway show despite being only 5 ft 7 in. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> were photographed by Heidi Klum on a bed in lingerie.

500|$|II.1 {{opens with}} a {{pantomime}} programme, which outlines, in relatively clear language, the identities and attributes of the book's main characters. The chapter then concerns a guessing game among the children, in which Shem is challenged three times to guess by [...] "gazework" [...] the colour which <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> chosen. Unable to answer due to his poor eyesight, Shem goes into exile in disgrace, and Shaun wins the affection of the girls. Finally HCE emerges from the pub and in a thunder-like voice calls the children inside.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} second plot of the story in this book shares the title, [...] "My Lucy Friend Who Smells Like Corn", with its {{corresponding}} section and is a short narrative about an unnamed narrator {{and her best friend}} Lucy Anguiano, the [...] "Texas girl who smells like corn". [...] This vignette offers a snapshot into life just north of the United States-Mexico border for two girls who are presumably of Mexican descent. Lucy's home is portrayed as a low-income, Mexican-American family. [...] Her mother is overworked and busy with many children while her father is rarely around. [...] However, the story focuses on the freedom that <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> when no one of authority is watching; for example, waving at strangers, jumping on mattresses, scratching mosquito bites, picking scabs, and somersaulting in dresses.|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolves}} around the adventures of three kindergarten aged girls with superpowers: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> {{to deal with the}} normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode [...] "Meet the Beat Alls," [...] which is an homage to the Beatles). The cartoon always tries to keep different ideas within each episode with some small tributes and parodies thrown in.|$|E

500|$|Ikumi {{had been}} one of ten girls her age that {{gathered}} at a seminar for people who wanted to join Fargo; she had been ordered to get on a truck which would take the small group to Fargo, and on the ride, Ikumi meets two other girls with similar goals in mind as her. One of the girls is named [...] who joined Fargo in order to save her older brother. She starts to work with Ikumi for the sake of their mutual goals. The second girl is named [...] who is searching for her older sister [...] who joined Fargo in order to obtain the 'invisible power', a kind of extrasensory perception. Yui has an optimistic personality which hides a gloomy past of which she has no memory of. Each of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> a strong will to complete their respective purposes, and they help each other along the way.|$|E
500|$|The Beauty Process {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Rolling Stone editor Alec Foege {{felt that the}} album is both more powerful and crisper than its predecessors, stating that the band had [...] "matured into punk's distaff Jagger and Richards." [...] Although he considered the song [...] "Lorenza, Giada, Alessandra" [...] to be a rip-off of Sonic Youth's [...] "Swimsuit Issue", he concluded that the band offers [...] "more fresh stylistic variations on classic punk into 40 minutes than most bands come up with during a career. Clever, cocky and ultimately ageless, The Beauty Process gives punk the face lift it deserves without smoothing the wrinkles." [...] Similarly, Heidi Macdonald of CMJ New Music Monthly praised the album's different moods and attitude-filled lyrics, commenting that The Beauty Process includes [...] "just enough self-examination to show that <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> grown up, bet they haven't gotten stale." ...|$|E
500|$|As they {{continue}} to grow and mature, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> many disappointing encounters which leave them fearful of the loneliness that must await them in this foreign country where they struggle hopelessly to fit in and be understood. Even as a grown woman, returning to her Dominican roots, Yolanda finds she can never truly escape the fear that has hovered over her {{for as long as}} she can remember. This is evident in the very first chapter, [...] "Antojos", as Alvarez reveals the panic evoked in the adult Yolanda at the sudden realization that she is stranded in a guava field in the Dominican Republic, where women do not go about unchaperoned at night. Alvarez evokes Yolanda's fear as she reports that [...] "the rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings of her old aunts: you will get lost, you will get kidnapped, you will get raped, you will get killed".|$|E

500|$|Present-day {{reviews from}} critics, however, are mostly positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that [...] "none of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> great voices, {{but they do}} exude {{personality}} and charisma, which is what drives bouncy dance-pop like 'Wannabe,' with its ridiculous 'zig-a-zig-ahhh' hook, into pure pop guilty pleasure." [...] Dan Cairns of The Sunday Times said that the song [...] "leaves a bad taste in the mouth: [...] the true legacy of Girl Power is, arguably, a preteen clothing industry selling crop tops and other minimal garments to young girls," [...] but added that it [...] "remains the same two minutes and 53 seconds of pop perfection that it ever was." [...] In a review of their Greatest Hits album, IGN said that after ten years it [...] "still sound reasonably fresh," [...] while Digital Spy's Nick Levine said that [...] "Wannabe" [...] still remained an [...] "exuberant calling card." [...] Billboard named the song #5 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.|$|E
500|$|... {{is one of}} the few Australian artists {{here who}} {{combines}} a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter landscapes in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to solve some of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to her taste, such as the rugged hills and beetling clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of [...] "Rough Country", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> a pensive dignity as though they are pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as caryatids. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.|$|E
500|$|In Tokyo Mew Mew, {{there are}} five Mew Mews: Ichigo Momomiya, Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara. Each Mew Mew has a [...] "mew mark" [...] left on her body, {{identifying}} her as a Mew Mew. Each mark is unique to the girl but all the marks are similar, representing an aspect of their power, such as Mew Ichigo's mark located on her inner thigh being shaped like her Strawberry Bell Bell weapon and Mew Mint's being a wing symbol on her back. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> powers related to their animal DNA when transformed while sporting {{the parts of the}} animals. They can also boost Mew Ichigo's power by combining their powers. The group were originally called the [...] "Mew Mews," [...] until they were accidentally caught on live television and Mew Ichigo introduced the group to the viewers as [...] "Tokyo Mew Mew". This became the name the public would call them thereafter. As part of being Mew Mews, the girls work as part-time waitresses at the Cafe Mew Mew, their headquarters from where they gather information on Chimera Anima activity.|$|E

500|$|Musically, {{the songs}} on Sucker Punch are {{highlighted}} with orchestrations and a rock edge. De Vries said that during the songs' production [...] "there was {{a substantial amount of}} reinvention, in several different directions", helped by Snyder giving the composers free reins. Bates added that there was an attempt to [...] "expand the scope of the songs in a way they were never heard before", with [...] "crazy electronic" [...] and [...] "alternative guitar work" [...] - [...] "it's a bit over the top, but so is everything on screen." [...] The versions of the songs tried to match the action on-screen: Bates detailed that [...] "White Rabbit" [...] "starts out very ethereal, getting [...] into the mindset of the dance, and once <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> their assignment, once they delve in with machineguns and other weapons, the song starts to bloom into this epic, rich, full orchestral choral fanfare." [...] This correspondence lead to the tracks getting longer and alternating between the songs themselves and [...] "a score that is reminiscent of songs sometimes", which Bates described as [...] "playing in the consciousness of the characters [...]" [...] For instance, [...] "White Rabbit" [...] features a choir of 150 voices playing the vocal melody of the first verse of the song, and tracks such as [...] "Search & Destroy" [...] have [...] "moments where Zach really wanted to blow it up into [...] huge orchestra".|$|E
500|$|Kaushik and {{his team}} taught the crew [...] "all [...] knew about hockey". In an interview, he later said that he [...] "taught him (Sahni) {{everything}} about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he [...] "trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But {{we were on a}} mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [...] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> worked very hard. I salute them". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned [...] "including the penalty stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen that it should be very realistic. I took the help of a lot of my former teammates. But more importantly, it was so easy working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted".|$|E
500|$|Jon Hornbuckle of So So Gay {{described}} [...] "DNA" [...] as [...] "an addictive {{slice of}} dark pop, with the chorus breakdown remaining {{not only a}} highlight on this track, but of the entire album." [...] The song was well received by Vicky Newman from Shields Gazette, who felt that it demonstrates the group's [...] "stunning" [...] harmonies and allows their voices to [...] "shine". Newman also wrote that the song's urban edge manifests Little Mix's growth and development. Gigwise's Andrew Trendell praised the track's production, writing, [...] "The skittering beats and little quirks of [...] 'DNA' make it instantly memorable." [...] Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail complimented the song's choral middle-eight, deeming it [...] "an inventive sonic flourish". [...] "DNA" [...] was described as [...] "pop perfection" [...] by Lewis Corner of Digital Spy, who highlighted the song's [...] "spooky synths, pumping heartbeats and gothic choir finale". John Earls from British newspaper, Daily Star, positively reviewed the single, calling it [...] "a winning formula," [...] in addition to awarding it a {{nine out of ten}} rating. Earls went on to mention that the song is [...] "A regal anthem that'll have all of Girls Aloud wondering how they didn't release it first, the Little Mixers are sounding huge at last.". [...] "DNA" [...] was deemed [...] "amazing" [...] by Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror. Eve Barlow for NME likened the song to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] and described it as [...] "a banger". According to Hackford Jones of music website, Pressparty, [...] "DNA" [...] is [...] "a storming slice of future-pop" [...] and [...] "a vibrant and commanding modern-day pop anthem that has the Little Mix personality stamped all the way through it." [...] Amy Gravelle of Entertainment Wise felt that the song represents the group's [...] "feisty charm". Gravelle also described the track as [...] "an infectiously catchy pop belter that proves <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> what it takes {{to keep up with the}} best of their rivals." [...] Ciara Moore from The College View said that [...] "DNA" [...] won Little Mix a legion of teenage fans. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman called the song [...] "bludgeoning, booming techno pop". 4Music's Trent Maynard said that [...] "DNA" [...] is a [...] "much darker turn for the cheery foursome, but just as catchy and polished as their previous single." [...] The song was described as [...] "an absolute gem" [...] by Lizzie Cox of Sugar. Rick Fulton of the Daily Record positively reviewed the song, awarding it three out of five stars. Fulton deemed the song as [...] "feisty electro fun" [...] and [...] "a bit harder than 'Wings'". He also added, [...] "it seems Little Mix have big aspirations to be around for a lot longer than most of 's winners." [...] Nicky Diaz of The Miami Hurricane said that [...] "DNA" [...] shows the group's edgier side. Diaz went on to praise the track's harmonies and lyrics, writing, [...] "The stand-out harmonies on this song are incredible and the lyrics are catchy". Matt Collar of AllMusic called the track [...] "a truly catchy, infectious cut".|$|E
