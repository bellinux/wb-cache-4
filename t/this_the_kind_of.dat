6000|$|As to our Florentine's Heaven, {{it is full}} of beauties also, though {{sometimes}} of a more questionable and pantomimical sort than {{is to be found in}} either of the other books. I shall speak of some of them presently; but the general impression of the place is, that it is no heaven at all. He says it is, and talks much of its smiles and its beatitude; but always excepting the poetry--especially the similes brought from the more heavenly earth--we realise little but a fantastical assemblage of doctors and doubtful characters, far more angry and theological than celestial; giddy raptures of monks and inquisitors dancing in circles, and saints denouncing popes and Florentines; in short, a heaven libelling itself with invectives against earth, and terminating in a great presumption. Many of the people put there, a Calvinistic Dante would have consigned to the [...] "other place;" [...] and some, if now living, would not be admitted into decent society. At the beginning of one of the cantos, the poet congratulates himself, with a complacent superiority, on his being in heaven and occupied with celestial matters, while his poor fellow-creatures are wandering and blundering on earth. But he had never got there! A divine--worthy of that name--of the Church of England (Dr. Whichcote), has beautifully said, that [...] "heaven is first a temper, and then a place." [...] According to this truly celestial topography, the implacable Florentine had not reached its outermost court. Again, his heavenly mistress, Beatrice, besides being far too didactic to sustain the womanly part of her character properly, alternates her smiles and her sarcasms in a way that jars horribly against the occasional enchantment of her aspect. She does not scruple to burst into taunts of the Florentines in the presence of Jesus himself; and the spirit of his ancestor, Cacciaguida, in the very bosom of Christian bliss, promises him revenge on his enemies! Is <b>this</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> zeal that is to be exempt from objection in a man who objected to all the world? or will it be thought a profaneness against such profanity, to remind the reader of the philosopher in Swift, who [...] "while gazing on the stars, was betrayed by his lower parts into a ditch!" ...|$|E

[...] Every single individual prays {{in his or her own}} particular way and there is no [...] "scientific method" [...] for praying. But what are we praying about? [...] One person contends in prayer for his share of the good things that fail to come, another for the honor that beckons, another for the happiness he wants to create for his beloved, another for the happiness that will flourish for him at his beloved’s side. One person contends in prayer against the horror of the past from which he is fleeing, another against the terror of the future into which he is staring, another with the secret horror that resides in solitude, another with the danger everyone sees. One person contends for the fulfillment of the wish, another against the fulfilled wish, since it was precipitous. One person strains every nerve even though he keeps on praying; another is expecting everything from the prayer even though he keeps on working; one ponders the relation of the fulfillment to the work; another ponders the misrelation. Alas, even though there is peace in the land, health and abundance, alas, even though the sun smiles bright and warm, there is still so much struggle. Alas, even when the overarching night sky is silent and starlit and the fields are at rest, there is still so much struggle!

40|$|Programme, which merit further discussion. It is a pity, therefore, that he mars {{his essay}} with snide {{comments}} about philosopher Paul Boghossian (‘had {{he not been}} doing his Ken Starr imitation’) and – ironically {{in the light of}} his focus on ‘misreading ’ – tendentious misrepresentations of our own views. Let us, therefore, deal quickly with the latter, before addressing more substantive questions. Referring to our views on the Strong Programme, Stolzenberg asserts (p. 79) baldly that we ‘wish to see it dead’. This is a pure invention on Stolzenberg’s part, without the slightest basis in what we have written. 1 Indeed, we are perplexed as to why Stolzenberg would choose to describe an intellectual debate in such emotion-laden (not to say militaristic) terms. 2 Quite simply, we think that some aspects of the Strong Programme are epistemologically and methodologically misguided; our essay in The One Culture was devoted to explaining our objections and the reasons behind them. Stolzenberg also accuses us of misreading a second-round comment of Jane Gregory’s. We think that Stolzenberg’s accusation is unjustified; but since the point at issue is relatively minor – a comment made in passing on the way to discussing the central question raised by Gregory – we leave the reader to judge for herself. 3 Stolzenberg cites (p. 80) approvingly Michael Lynch’s ‘thoughtful analyses of pop metaphysical one-liners by Sokal, Weinberg and Richard Dawkins’. But he does not ask why Lynch chose to analyse a one-liner taken from a three-page polemical article, rather than the 56 -page book chapter devoted to a detailed analysis of questions from the philosophy of science. 4 Finally, Stolzenberg takes us to task for prefacing a statement with the words ‘it seems obvious that’; he claims that we give ‘no argument ’ in favour of the assertion in question, and he concludes by asking sarcastic-ally: ‘Is <b>this</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> scholarship that they and their admirers favor? ’ Bu...|$|E
40|$|Through {{a little}} {{investigation}} by file types {{it is possible}} to easily find {{that one of the most}} popular search engines has in its indexes about 10 billion of images. Even considering that this data is probably an underestimate of the real number, however, immediately it gives us an idea of how the images are a key component in human communication. This so exorbitant number puts us in the face of the enormous difficulties encountered when one has to deal with them. Until now, the images have always been accompanied by textual data: description, tags, labels, [...] . which are used to retrieve them fromthe archives. However it is clear that their increase, occurred in recent years, does not allow this type cataloguing. Furthermore, for its own nature, a manual cataloguing is subjective, partial and without doubt subject to error. To overcome this situation in recent years it has gotten a footing a kind of search based on the intrinsic characteristics of images such as colors and shapes. This information is then converted into numerical vectors, and through their comparison {{it is possible to}} find images that have similar characteristics. It is clear that a search, on this level of representation of the images, is far from the user perception that of the images. To allow the interaction between users and retrieval systems and improve the performance, it has been decided to involve the user in the search allowing to him to give a feedback of relevance of the images retrieved so far. In <b>this</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> image that are interesting for user can be learnt by the system and an improvement in the next iteration can be obtained. These techniques, although studied for many years, still present open issues. High dimensional feature spaces, lack of relevant training images, and feature spaceswith lowdiscriminative capability are just some of the problems encountered. In this thesis these problems will be faced by proposing some innovative solutions both to improve performance obtained by methods proposed in the literature, and to provide to retrieval systems greater generalization capability. Techniques of data fusion, both at the feature space level and at the level of different retrieval techniques, will be presented, showing that the former allow greater discriminative capability while the latter provide more robustness to the system. To overcome the lack of images of training it will be proposed a method to generate synthetic patterns allowing in this way a more balanced learning. Finally, new methods to measure similarity between images and to explore more efficiently the feature space will be proposed. The presented results show that the proposed approaches are indeed helpful in resolving some of the main problems in content based image retrieval...|$|E
40|$|This Final Degree Project {{has been}} carried out in the frame of the project S 2013 /ICE- 3000 (SPADERadar-CM), SPACE DEBRIS RADAR, and {{describes}} the work performed in the design of an antenna that operates at 94 GHz (W band) which radiates simultaneously a sum channel an a difference channel {{to be part of a}} system able to detect space debris in board systems. This use is gaining in significance since the amount of space debris in the orbitals more used, such as the geostationary one, is growing (it is estimated that right now around 10 million pieces of debris are swarming in orbit) and collisions with functioning systems could cause very serious damage to the structures. That is why, a systems which offers a way to avoid these collisions will become a crucial system. To perform <b>this,</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> system we will need is a radar, and with the tracking function in mind, one of the most common ways to get this system is with the radiation of two channels, sum and difference channel. Sum diagram is useful to detect an object approaching, and with the null in the difference pattern we are able to track the object detected. Having this goal in mind, it will be necessary the transmission of a combination of electromagnetic modes to generate the radiation patterns we are interested in (both sum and difference channels). In the introduction, dedicated to the state of art, we explore the different kinds of horn antennas and explain in detail the considerations to decide the best antenna for this project and the best electromagnetic modes to generate the radiation patterns we are interested in. After the introduction we start explaining the process followed to design the matching and mode generating structure, in which we start by getting the initial values of the waveguides used and then its behavior is optimized to get the results we need, in addition to the optimization some changes in the structure are introduced to evaluate its contribution to the complete design, the whole process is analyzed successfully thanks to the use of the commercial software of electromagnetic analysis HFSS. The designing process of the horn antenna was started with initial values obtained from theoretical expressions (initial design of a conical horn antenna, length and size of the aperture). And based on those initial designs and values it has been performed an optimizing and improving process of the radiating parameters, once again using the same commercial software of electromagnetic analysis as in the design of the matching structure, HFSS. Finally, the complete design is analyzed to see the final behavior offered by the complete structure, (matching structure and horn antenna together). And in view of these results, we offer future lines that could be followed to improve the behavior of the system...|$|E
