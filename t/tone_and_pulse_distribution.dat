40|$|The {{industrial}} {{application of the}} dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) has a long tradition. However, the {{lack of understanding of}} some of its fundamental issues, such as the stochastic behaviors, is still a challenge for DBD researchers. In this project, considerable efforts to understand the fundamental aspects of DBD have been made. The aim of this work is to study the electrical characteristics of DBD to determine a suitable condition for utilization of the device for applications. Several diagnostic tools such as high-voltage probe, resistive current, charge measurement, and high-speed camera imaging were employed for the investigation. In order to study the electrical behaviors of DBD, the experimental work was carried out in two parts: current pulse amplitude statistical studies and the energy investigation. For the pulse amplitude statistical studies, the stochastic variation of the current pulse amplitude has been analyzed by the statistical method. The stochastic behavior of the discharge current amplitude has been compared with a proposed empirical equation of the <b>distribution</b> <b>pulse</b> height. This proposed statistical function is found to be in good agreement with the experimental discharge pulse amplitude variation for discharges with varying space gaps. This empirical equation successfully predicts the existence of two discharge regimes, which were observed from the experimental results. For the energy investigation, the DBD dissipation energy was studied experimentally and numerically. A dynamic circuit model constructed with Matlab Simulink accurately simulated the discharge energy of DBD. The surface resistance introduced in this electrical model represents the average effect that effectively accounts for the resistance encountered by the charges between the discharging and non-discharging regions on the dielectric. The expanded QV Lissajous can be reasonably {{explained by the fact that}} the total energy is summed by the energy of the DBD discharge and the energy consumed by the spreading II charges on the dielectric surface. By having the experimental results accurately fitted with the simulated results from the model, the efficiency of discharge can be obtained from the electrical modeling. The efficiency of the DBD has been found to be higher with a smooth surface compared to a rough surface. The efficiency is reduced when the applied voltage is increased.

40|$|The psychometric {{function}} {{relates the}} probability of a correct response to the variation of a physical stimulus parameter. In many perceptual tasks one point on this function is defined by a more or less arbitrary threshold criterion and threshold is used to study the effects of various treatments or age. Besides threshold, the shape of the psychometric function provides additional information. The variability of internal (neural) noise and the sensorineural transduction function will affect the shape of the psychometric function and may, therefore, reveal important features in the processing of stimulus characteristics. Here we analyze the effect of age on psychometric functions from gerbils: (A) for the detection of a tone or noise pulse in silence which is generally regarded as a measure of cochlear function and (B) for a gap detection task, investigating aspects of temporal processing that involve the ascending auditory pathway.
