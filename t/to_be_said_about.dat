According to Bill Stewart of PopMatters, [...] "Appeal to Reason is a Rise Against album.

Bruno Mars never moved {{more than three}} steps in any direction during his performance. His voice soared and his passion was palpable as he performed". He concluded, [...] "when his time came, Mars left his mark". Mathew Jacobs of The Huffington Post believes that [...] "the jazzy new song marked one of the night's tamer moments". He praised Mars performance by saying he [...] "offered a brand of artistry unmatched by {{the bulk of the}} telecast." [...] Grading the performances of the show, the staff from Entertainment Weekly gave Mars' performance an A-, describing it as [...] "The most elegantly designed and executed performance of the evening". MTV News' Brenna Ehrlich classified the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards performance as a [...] "show that rivaled anything you'd find in the city's famous — and infamous — Red Light District". The UK edition of The Huffington Post commented that despite Mars' voice being on top form, it was the pole-dancer performance who stole the show. Other performers, such as Ed Sheeran and Adam Lambert praised the interpretation by calling it an amazing performance and noticing Mars' vocals, respectively. Hilary Duff called [...] "Gorilla" [...] a [...] "straight baby making music".|$|E

500|$|For {{the roles}} of Jane, Ricky, and Angela, DreamWorks gave Mendes carte blanche. By November 1998, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari had been cast in the parts—in Birch's case, despite the fact she was underage for her nude scene. As Birch was 16 {{at the time she}} made the film, and thus {{classified}} as a minor in the United States, her parents had to approve her brief topless scene in the movie. Child labor representatives were on the set for the shooting of the scene. Bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast. The 2009 documentary My Big Break followed Bentley, and several other young actors, before and after he landed the part. To prepare, Mendes provided Bentley with a video camera, telling the actor to film what Ricky would. Peter Gallagher and Alison Janney were cast (as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts) after filming began in December 1998. Mendes gave Janney a book of paintings by Edvard Munch. He told her, [...] "Your character is in there somewhere." [...] Mendes cut much of Barbara's dialogue, including conversations between Colonel Fitts and her, as he felt that what needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the pair—their humanity and vulnerability—was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Fitts, Scott Bakula plays Jim Olmeyer, and Sam Robards plays Jim Berkley. Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal, happy—and boring—couple in the film. Ball's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a [...] "bland, boring, heterosexual couple" [...] who wore matching clothes: [...] "I can't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring." [...] Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename.|$|E

He has noted that the songs [...] "Pantomime Horse" [...] and B-side [...] "He's Dead" [...] were {{the product of an}} unhappy mind and that he could not have written such songs if he had been happy.

2500|$|Sackville-West {{loved to}} travel, {{frequently}} going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia, and these trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse with its theme of longing {{for someone who}} is not there was inspired partly by the frequent absences of Sackville-West. Woolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write one of her most famous novels, , featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West's son Nigel Nicolson as [...] "the longest and most charming love-letter in literature." [...] Unusually, Woolf documented the moment of the conception of Orlando: she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: [...] "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other" [...] (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband Leonard Woolf). Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write Orlando, asking in a letter: [...] "But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind...Do you mind, say Yes or No?" [...] Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. [...] Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves to too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. [...] Orlando, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world. After finishing Orlando, Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: [...] "For Promiscuous you are and that is all <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> it. Look in the Index of Orlando-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity passim". In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: [...] "Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting...I'm not so sure...I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks".|$|E
