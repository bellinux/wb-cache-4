Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|R

The full layout of the castle is uncertain, but a gatehouse, with twin towers and a portcullis, was positioned on the east side, and at least five other towers were positioned around the walls. The walls and towers were [...] thick and built from chert stone rubble with occasional pieces of iron slag left over from the roman and medieval metalworking around the village; they would originally have been rendered and whitewashed with lime.|$|R

500|$|Further {{momentum}} {{was lost}} when Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned to redesign the terrace {{in front of}} the Basilica in 1656. After discarding several sketches, Bernini settled on a colossal open space in the shape of an ellipse. With the potential expense of clearing Borgo, Bernini decided instead {{to make use of the}} warren of poorly maintained medieval buildings to obscure any view of the Vatican structures from any significant distance. In this way, pilgrims emerged from the relative darkness of the city into the vast open space and grandeur of the Square and its surrounding buildings [...] a sight calculated to inspire awe in first-time visitors to the Holy See's seat of power. Bernini had originally planned <b>to</b> demolish a <b>square</b> <b>roughly</b> 100m <b>to</b> a side directly {{in front of the}} square, filling the space with a third colonnade (or [...] "terzo braccio") to match the two still standing today. This would afford a longer vantage point to allow visitors a better viewing angle of the new Basilica. The death of his patron, Pope Alexander VII, put a halt to Bernini's work. The third set of columns was abandoned, and Bernini's piazza remained open-ended and incomplete.|$|R

2500|$|Hundreds of Antelope Creek {{settlements}} {{have been}} discovered. [...] Archaeologist Christopher Lintz identified eleven different variations of buildings in villages, hamlets and isolated farmsteads. [...] The most notable buildings were rectangular, single-storied, multi-room structures {{with up to}} 30 rooms. [...] The rooms ranged in size from small up <b>to</b> 60 <b>square</b> meters <b>square</b> (<b>roughly</b> 30 feet by 20 feet). [...] The multi-room dwellings {{appear to have been}} constructed between 1200 and 1350. Thereafter, individual dwellings were preferred, often about 6 meters by 6 meters (20×20 feet) in size and using the same stone-slab construction methods.|$|R

5000|$|Manganese {{occurs in}} {{different}} states, including Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+. Todorokite {{is made up}} of (Mn4+O6) octahedra that share edges to form triple chains. These chains share corners <b>to</b> form <b>roughly</b> <b>square</b> tunnels parallel <b>to</b> the b crystal axis. [...] The tunnels accommodate water molecules and large cations such as potassium K+, barium Ba2+, silver Ag+, lead Pb2+, calcium Ca2+ and sodium Na+. [...] The octahedra {{at the edges of the}} triple chains are larger than those in the middle and therefore are likely to accommodate the larger cations (magnesium Mg, manganese Mn3+, copper Cu2+, cobalt Co, nickel Ni etc.), whilst the middle octahedra are occupied by the smaller Mn4+ cations. This structure is similar to that of hollandite (BaMn2+Mn4+7O16) and romanèchite ((Ba,H2O)2(Mn4+,Mn3+)5O10), but with larger tunnels. [...] Although tunnels formed from triple chains of octahedra are most common in todorokite, occasional tunnels have been observed in crystals from both terrestrial and manganese nodule deposits that have one pair of sides formed by triple chains, but with the other pair of sides formed from chains 4, 5, 8 or more octahedra wide.|$|R
5000|$|Many ancient Chinese books contain {{thousands}} of words with no spaces between them; however, when necessary to explicitly denote a pause or break, Judou marks such as [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] were used. Similar {{to the development}} of punctuation in Europe, there were varying types of Judou marks. For instance, a Song Dynasty print of Chronicles of Huayang used full-width spaces to denote a stop, whereas a print of Jingdian Shiwen from the same dynasty simply used [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] marks. Also, Qu Yuan's Li Sao used the character [...] and grammatical particles to denote stops, similar to Judou marks.In Chinese writing, each character conforms <b>to</b> a <b>roughly</b> <b>square</b> frame so that the text as a whole can fit into a grid. Because of this, East Asian punctuation marks are larger than their European counterparts, as they should occupy a square area that is {{the same size as the}} characters around them. These punctuation marks are called fullwidth to contrast them from halfwidth European punctuation marks.|$|R
