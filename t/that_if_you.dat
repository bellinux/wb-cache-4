5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E

5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

25|$|Frederick's {{interest}} in horticulture {{caused him to}} develop several large gardens on the Vanderbilt estate. These lavish gardens incorporated the formal Italian style. This meant that the beds were arranged {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> drew a line across the middle, either horizontally or vertically, one side of the line would mirror the other side. These formal gardens also consisted of multiple tiers, which depended on the type of plants. Each level was different. Frederick himself added the rose garden which contained almost 2000 vintage rose bushes along with other kinds of roses.|$|E
25|$|A {{probability}} {{is a way}} of assigning {{every event}} a value between zero and one, with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results (in our example, the event {1,2,3,4,5,6}) is assigned a value of one. To qualify as a probability, the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look at a collection of mutually exclusive events (events with no common results, e.g., the events {1,6}, {3}, and {2,4} are all mutually exclusive), the probability {{that at least one of}} the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events.|$|E
25|$|TSA rules state <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{move your}} fire demon {{next to an}} {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasoning}} is increased activity leads to increased learning, {{which leads to}} lower costs, {{which can lead to}} lower prices, which can lead to increased market share, which can lead to increased profitability and market dominance. According to BCG, the most effective business strategy was one of striving for market dominance in this way. This was particularly true when a firm had an early leadership in market share. It was claimed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> cannot get enough market share to be competitive, you should get out of that business and concentrate your resources where you can take advantage of experience effects and gain dominant market share. The BCG strategists developed product portfolio techniques like the BCG Matrix (in part) to manage this strategy.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly.

I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were going to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E
