5|$|By {{the summer}} of 2009, THSRC's {{cumulative}} losses were equivalent to two-thirds of its equity capital. In response to global financial crisis and domestic economic recession, THSRC proposed to increase income and reduce expenditures in several aspects {{in the hope of}} raising operation performances. In February 2009, THSRC announced to adjust <b>train</b> <b>frequency,</b> cut down salary payment by 10~20% among management level, and measured to expand fare promotion to stimulate rider ship.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station. Originally operating as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the Hammersmith branch to increase <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains run in a spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the loop, back to Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains may start running express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the F trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly more crowded than current F trains, but the F locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E

25|$|Hamburg S-Bahn {{fulfills}} all {{criteria for}} heavy rail inside {{the state and}} city of Hamburg, but some lines go beyond the state border into the state of Niedersachsen and there the S-Bahn runs with lower <b>train</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> {{and lack of}} proper inspection led to numerous railway disasters. On July 7, 1909, for example, a train leaving Haifa crashed into a train travelling from Damascus due to an error on the telegraphist's part. The driver of the Haifa–Tiberias train was killed.|$|E
30|$|The {{existing}} data {{does not}} provide a strong correlation between increased weekly <b>training</b> <b>frequency</b> (HF) and maximal strength gain in upper and lower body resistance exercises for a mixed population group. When RT is volume-equated for combined multi-joint and isolation exercises, there is no significant effect of RT frequency on muscular strength gain.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of balance <b>training</b> <b>frequency</b> on functional improvement in elderly people over 75 years of age. The subjects comprised 14 institutionalized elderly people aged 84. 9 ± 5. 8 years (mean±SD). The training program consisted of balance training, five times a week, for 1 year. Muscle strength, balance, agility, mobility and flexibility were assessed at the beginning and the end of the 1 -year intervention period. The ratio of attended to scheduled sessions was used as an index of <b>training</b> <b>frequency.</b> The <b>training</b> <b>frequency</b> showed significant correlations to the improvement rate of knee extension strength (r= 0. 59) and modified SLR test (r= 0. 63). Discriminant analysis revealed correct prediction frequency of 43. 3, 54. 8 % and 57. 2 %, for the maintenance of muscle strength, balance and flexibility, respectively. In conclusion, balance <b>training</b> <b>frequency</b> significantly affects the improvement of physical performance in frail elderly people. Elderly people would need training at least two or three times a week to maintain muscle strength, balance and flexibility...|$|R
25|$|The {{light rail}} line {{operates}} all 7 {{days of the}} week. It begins operations at 3:30a.m. weekdays and 4:30a.m. weekends and ends service at 12:30a.m. Monday through Thursday nights, 2:45a.m. Friday and Saturday nights and, 12:30a.m. Sunday nights. Scheduled <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> varies from 6 minutes during the day to 20 minutes off-peak.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason was}} the {{improved}} {{capacity of the}} U2 tunnel that was needed to accommodate the U3 traffic. Current subway lines in Nuremberg are built for a <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> of 200 seconds or 3 minutes (sole exception: Ziegelstein-Flughafen: 400 seconds), which is already fully used on the U1 {{during the day and}} on the U2 during morning rush hour. With the new ATC system in place, additional (virtual) blocks will exist between stationary block signals, thus increasing line capacity to a <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> of 100 seconds. However, these new blocks can only be used by ATC-operated trains since they are virtual and have no stationary signal associated with them that can be observed by a driver-operated train without ATC equipment. Thus the increased line capacity can only be effectively used after the U2 has been converted to full ATC operation.|$|E
25|$|The BMRCL {{launched}} a Namma Metro app for Android devices in 2013. However, it had limited features. The app was officially re-launched on 4 November 2016 with additional features.

25|$|U21 trains ran {{only from}} Röthenbach to Ziegelstein on the U2. Since the {{single-track}} tunnel between Ziegelstein and Flughafen ("Airport") could only accommodate a <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> of 400 seconds {{at the time}} (or roughly one train every 6 minutes), only every second train during the day ran to the airport (Flughafen), while the other trains reversed at Ziegelstein. On the way back all trains were designated as U2 since they all run to Röthenbach, and therefore indicating whether trains originated from Ziegelstein or Flughafen was meaningless to passengers.|$|E
25|$|The highway has {{not been}} {{expanded}} since its initial construction. Today, commuting traffic {{into and out of}} the downtown core moves very slowly during the rush hours, which has led to growth in commuting by other modes. Introduced in the 1960s, the province's GO Transit has increased <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> and capacity along the Lakeshore route to the point where GO now carries 19% of inbound commuters to downtown, while the Gardiner carries 8%. The TTC carries 47% of commuters and other auto routes account for 26% of inbound commuters, according to 2006 figures.|$|E
25|$|Traffic on {{the lines}} reached its peak during this period. The {{introduction}} of automatic block signals allowed an increase in <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> to every 6 minutes. Construction of a third track on the Gdynia – Rumia segment also continued. Thanks to the change to 3000V, the electric multiple units were able to operate beyond the Gdańsk – Wejherowo line, and run on the same tracks as standard trains in case of emergency. As a result, regular trains could also run on SKM tracks. In 1975, the annual number of passengers travelling by SKM exceeded 100 million people. Ridership sometimes reached 300 thousand passengers daily.|$|E

25|$|As {{train service}} {{patterns}} settled down {{later in the}} nineteenth century, the Caledonian main line carried important express trains, {{as well as local}} stopping trains. In contrast to the frequent regular-interval services of the present day, the <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> was limited. In 1895 there were four daytime expresses northbound; the first left Euston at 5.15 a.m. Many trains divided at Carstairs with separate portions from there to Edinburgh and in some cases Perth and Aberdeen. There were two sleeping car trains to Glasgow and two to Aberdeen. All the daytime trains called at Beattock, and there were four all-stations stopping trains as well as some short workings. The fastest journey from Carlisle to Glasgow took 2 hours 10 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Be'er Sheva North University {{station is}} the {{terminus}} {{of the line}} to Dimona. All stations of Israel Railways can be accessed from Beersheba using transfer stations in Tel Aviv and Lod. Until 2012, the railway line to Beersheba used a slow single-track configuration with sharp curves and many level crossings which limited train speed. Between 2004 and 2012 the line was double tracked and rebuilt using an improved alignment and all its level crossings were grade separated. The rebuilding effort cost NIS 2.8billion and significantly reduced the travel time and greatly increased the <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> to and from Tel Aviv and Kiryat Motzkin to Beersheba. In addition, Beersheba will be linked to Tel Aviv and Eilat by a new passenger and freight high-speed railway system.|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background The effects of balance training (BT) in older adults on proxies of postural control and mobility are well {{documented in the}} literature.

Objectives The objectives of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis are to quantify BT intervention effects and to additionally characterize dose–response relationships of BT modalities (e. g., <b>training</b> period, <b>training</b> <b>frequency)</b> through the analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that could maximize improve-ments in balance performance in healthy community...|$|R
30|$|This {{meta-analysis}} {{has several}} strengths that separate it from other previous analyses of <b>training</b> <b>frequency.</b> This analysis attempted to apply more robust criteria {{to try to}} control potential confounding variables when comparing the effects of weekly <b>training</b> <b>frequency</b> on strength outcomes. Our intent to create an evidence-based dose-response curve of frequency to strength gain was subverted and resulted in a high- vs. low-frequency comparison for some strength measures. This meta-analysis also considered the possible effects of different sections {{of the body and}} the impact it has on strength outcomes on the impact of LF or HF weekly <b>training</b> <b>frequency.</b> The design of this study also differed from others, as it did not cluster outcomes. Instead, data were combined across strength measures to improve external validity. Within our design, we considered and included a multi-level model as a strategy for testing heterogeneity across included studies.|$|R
25|$|Under Mayor William O'Dwyer and General Charles P. Gross, another {{plan was}} put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross {{believed}} that {{construction of a}} Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. This plan would again connect the Second Avenue Line to Brooklyn. As with Pheifer's proposal, a <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> map was created; however, Bingham's proposal involved more branch lines and track connections. A connection to Brooklyn was to be made via the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridge, and would allow trains from these bridges to go onto the Sixth Avenue Line or the Second Avenue Line. Other connections to the Second Avenue Line were to be provided at 57th Street, via a line connecting to the Sixth Avenue Line; two express tracks would be built along that line north of West Fourth Street. The IRT Pelham Line would be switched to the combined IND/BMT division (this plan also includes other connections, which have been built), and connected to the Second Avenue Line. The Second Avenue Line would end just north of that connection, at 149th Street, with transfers to the IRT White Plains Road Line and the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line, the latter {{of which would be}} demolished south of 149th Street. There would also be a connection to the IND Concourse Line. The line was to be built in sections. The Manhattan section was top-priority, but the Brooklyn section was 19th on the priority list, and the Bronx section did not have a specific priority.|$|E
500|$|Several subway {{lines have}} reached their {{operational}} limits {{in terms of}} <b>train</b> <b>frequency</b> and passengers, according to data released by the Transit Authority. , all of the A Division services except the 42nd Street Shuttle, {{as well as the}} E and L trains, were beyond capacity, as well as portions of the [...] train. In April 2013, New York magazine reported that the system was more crowded {{than it had been in}} the previous 66 years. The subway reached a daily ridership of 6 million for 29 days in 2014, and was expected to record a similar ridership level for 55 days in 2015; by comparison, in 2013, daily ridership never reached 6 million. In particular, the express tracks of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line are noted for operating at full capacity during peak hours. The Long Island Rail Road East Side Access project is expected to bring many more commuters to the Lexington Avenue Line when it opens around the year 2022, further overwhelming its capacity.|$|E
