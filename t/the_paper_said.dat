The paper he worked for organized a contest in which any boys who gained 15 new customers could win a trip to New Orleans. Barry and a couple of the other black paperboys reached the quota of 15 new customers yet were not allowed to go on the trip to New Orleans, a segregated city. <b>The</b> <b>paper</b> <b>said</b> it could not afford to hire two buses to satisfy Mississippi's segregation rules. Barry decided to boycott his paper route until they agreed to send the black paperboys on a trip. After the paper offered the black paperboys a chance to go to St. Louis, Missouri on a trip, because it was not a segregated city, Barry resumed his paper route.|$|E

Desson Howe, writing for The Washington Posts Weekend section, said that [...] "the Klingons' spilled blood floats {{in the air}} in eerily beautiful purplish globules; it's space-age Sam Peckinpah." [...] Maslin considered some effects garish, but appreciated the filmmakers' tirelessness [...] "in trying to make their otherworldly characters look strange".|$|E

500|$|Contemporary press {{reaction}} to 2K and their Barbican performance was mixed but mostly negative.

[...] Another favorable word came from Kazakh novelist Sapabek Asip-uly, who suggested Baron Cohen be nominated for the annual award bestowed by the Kazakh Club of Art Patrons. In a letter published by the newspaper Vremya, Asip-uly wrote, [...] "(Borat) has managed to spark an immense interest of the whole world in Kazakhstan—something our authorities could not do during the years of independence.

500|$|On October 12, 1913, the New York Sun {{became the}} first major {{northern}} paper to give {{a detailed account of}} the Frank trial. In discussing the charges of antisemitism in the trial, it described Atlanta as more liberal on the subject than any other southern cities. It {{went on to say that}} antisemitism did arise during the trial as Atlantans reacted to statements attributed to Frank's Jewish supporters, who dismissed Phagan as [...] "nothing but a factory girl". <b>The</b> <b>paper</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The anti-Semitic feeling was the natural result of the belief that the Jews had banded to free Frank, innocent or guilty. The supposed solidarity of the Jews for Frank, even if he was guilty, caused a Gentile solidarity against him." [...] On November 8, 1913, the executive committee of the American Jewish Committee, headed by Louis Marshall, addressed the Frank case. They did so following Judge Roan's reconsideration motion and motivated by the issues raised in the Sun. They chose not to take a public stance as a committee, instead deciding to raise funds individually to influence public opinion in favor of Frank.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, a US National Institutes of Health {{study showed}} {{a link between}} paraquat use and Parkinson's disease in farm workers.

Paraquat-induced toxicity in rats has also been linked to Parkinson's-like neurological degenerative mechanisms. A study by the Buck Institute for Research on Aging showed a connection between exposure to paraquat and iron in infancy and mid-life Parkinson's in laboratory mice.

Paladino was supported at the time by the Tea Party movement, and {{in an interview with}} The New York Times, his campaign manager embraced the outsider nature of their bid in the 2010 New York gubernatorial election: [...] "This is a campaign of junkyard dogs, not pedigreed poodles. Carl knows the background of everyone who works for him. He knows that each of us comes to the campaign with warts. And he has his own warts. We don't hide anything." [...] Paladino explained his hiring choice of Caputo as campaign manager to The New York Times: [...] "I'm facing some major demons here, and I needed someone who could go right back on top of them in a matter of minutes.

[...] A 2007 review {{of the relationship between}} pelvic floor dysfunction and sexual problems in men and women found that they are commonly linked and suggested that physical therapy strengthening the pelvic floor could help address the sexual problems but that it was not well studied enough to recommend.

This was later criticized as 'science by press conference'. According to BBC News, it was this press conference, rather than the paper in The Lancet, that fuelled the MMR vaccination scare. [...] According to the BBC, [...] "He told journalists it was a 'moral issue' and he could no longer support the continued use of the three-in-one jab for measles, mumps and rubella.

[...] He suggested parents should opt for single vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella, separated by gaps of one year.
