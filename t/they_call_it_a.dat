I have been thinking upon what {{you tell me about}} these singular people, whose existence I hardly knew of before. Now, Lucian, {{in the course of my}} reading I have come upon denunciations of every race and pursuit under the sun. Very respectable and well-informed men have held that Jews, Irishmen, Christians, atheists, lawyers, doctors, politicians, actors, artists, flesh-eaters, and spirit-drinkers are all of necessity degraded beings. Such statements can be easily proved by taking a black sheep from each flock, and holding him up as the type. It is more reasonable to argue a man's character from the nature of his profession; and yet even that is very unsafe. War is a cruel business; but soldiers are not necessarily bloodthirsty and inhuman men. I am not quite satisfied that a prize-fighter is a violent and dangerous man because he follows a violent and dangerous profession--I suppose <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> profession." ...|$|E
60|$|In that case, {{my opinion}} is this: Whenever it happens that a man can claim nothing {{according}} to the rules of commerce and the principles of justice, he passes out of that department, and comes within the jurisdiction of mercy. In that province the magistrate has nothing at all to do; his interference is a violation of the property which it is his office to protect. Without all doubt, charity to the poor is a direct and obligatory duty upon all Christians, next in order after the payment of debts, full as strong, and by Nature made infinitely more delightful to us Pufendorf, and other casuists, do not, I think, denominate it quite properly, when <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> duty of imperfect obligation. But the manner, mode, time, choice of objects, and proportion are left to private discretion; and perhaps for that very reason it is performed with the greater satisfaction, because the discharge of it has more the appearance of freedom,--recommending us besides very specially to the Divine favor, as the exercise of a virtue most suitable to a being sensible of its own infirmity.|$|E

60|$|I {{accepted}} her offer, and {{was with her}} half a year, {{and should have been}} longer, but in that interval what she proposed to me happened to herself, and she married very much to her advantage. But whose fortune soever was upon the increase, mine seemed to be upon the wane, and I found nothing present, except two or three boatswains, or such fellows, but as for the commanders, they were generally of two sorts: 1. Such as, having good business, that is to say, a good ship, resolved not to marry but with advantage, that is, with a good fortune; 2. Such as, being out of employ, wanted a wife to help them to a ship; I mean (1) a wife who, having some money, could enable them to hold, as <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> good part of a ship themselves, so to encourage owners to come in; or (2) a wife who, if she had not money, had friends who were concerned in shipping, and so could help to put the young man into a good ship, which to them is as good as a portion; and neither of these was my case, so I looked like one that was to lie on hand.|$|E
6000|$|And now, {{once for}} all, {{let it be}} clearly {{understood}} that an [...] "impression on the mind" [...] does not mean a piece of manufacture. The way in which most artists proceed to [...] "invent," [...] as <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> picture, is this: they choose their subject, for the most part, well, with a sufficient quantity of towers, mountains, ruined cottages, and other materials, to be generally interesting; then they fix on some object for a principal light; behind this they put a dark cloud, or, in front of it, a dark piece of foreground; then they repeat this light somewhere else in a less degree, and connect the two lights together by some intermediate ones. If they find {{any part of the}} foreground uninteresting they put a group of figures into it; if any part of the distance, they put something there from some other sketch; and proceed to inferior detail in the same manner, taking care always to put white stones near black ones, and purple colors near yellow ones, and angular forms near round ones;--all being as simply a matter of recipe and practice as cookery; like that, not by any means a thing easily done well, but still having no reference whatever to [...] "impressions on the mind." ...|$|E

Mr. Tretherick has been dead just one month; but we presume the gallant colonel is not afraid of ghosts." [...] It is but just to Mrs. Tretherick to state that the colonel's victory was by no means an easy one. To a natural degree of coyness {{on the part of the}} lady was added the impediment of a rival,--a prosperous undertaker from Sacramento, who had first seen and loved Mrs. Tretherick at the theatre and church; his professional habits debarring him from ordinary social intercourse, and indeed any other than the most formal public contact with the sex. As this gentleman had made a snug fortune during the felicitous prevalence of a severe epidemic, the colonel regarded him as a dangerous rival. Fortunately, however, the undertaker was called in professionally to lay out a brother-senator, who had unhappily fallen by the colonel's pistol in an affair of honor; and either deterred by physical consideration from rivalry, or wisely concluding that the colonel was professionally valuable, he withdrew from the field.|$|E

60|$|It {{had never}} been so peopled by the Franks as to lose either the {{language}} or the cultivation left by the Romans.

'Ah, I {{dare say}} you were, Mr. Blenkinsopp,' the doctor {{answered}} blandly, {{with just the}} faintest tinge of unconscious satire, peering at his square unintelligent features as a fancier peers at {{the face of a}} bull-dog; 'I dare say you were now. After all, however clever a set of boys may be, one of them MUST be {{at the bottom of the}} form, in the nature of things, mustn't he? And your Charlie, I think, is only fifteen. Ah, yes; well, well; he'll do better, no doubt, if we keep him here a year or two longer. So then there's the second: Guy, you call him, if I remember right--Cyril Anastasius Guy--our Blenkinsopp minor. Guy's a good boy; an excellent boy: to tell you the plain truth, Mr. Blenkinsopp, I don't know much of him personally myself, which is a fact that tells greatly in his favour. Charlie I must admit I have to call up some times for reproof: Guy, never. Charlie's in the fifth form: Guy's seventh in the fourth. A capital place for a boy of his age! He's very industrious, you know--what we call a plodder. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> plodder, you see, at thirteen, Mr. Blenkinsopp, but a man of ability at forty.'

[...] "I observe, in the first place, that you no sooner shake off the authority of the birch but you affect to distinguish yourselves from your dirty school-fellows by a new drugget, a pair of prim ruffles, a new bob-wig, and a brazen-hilted sword." [...] As soon as they arrived in Oxford, these youths were hospitably received [...] "amongst a parcel of honest, merry fellows, who think themselves obliged, in honour and common civility, to make you DAMNABLE DRUNK, and carry you, as <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> CORPSE to bed." [...] When this period of jollity is ended, the freshman must declare his views. He must see that he is in the fashion; [...] "and let your declarations be, that you are CHURCHMEN, and that you believe as the CHURCH believes. For instance, you have subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles; but never venture to explain the sense in which you subscribed them, because there are various senses; so many, indeed, that scarce two men understand them in the same, and no TRUE CHURCHMAN in that which the words bear, and in that which they were written." ...|$|E
