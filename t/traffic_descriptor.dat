This paper presents an exhaustive study of Poisson traffic within the Géant network, when the traffic is sent as high or low priority traffic. These studies try to give guidelines of the range of profile deformation in large-scale core networks for QoS implementation. The characteristic of the traffic studied is the self-similarity of the traffic, since self-similarity in Poisson-in-origin traffic indicates burstiness for larger time scales, what may cause unexpected dropping of packets in the policer.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} video transport over ATM networks using knowledge of both video system de-sign and broadband networks. We find that the following trends hold for all sequences examined. First, increasing the delay in the video system decreases the necessary peak rate and significantly increases the number of calls that can be carried by the network. Second, as an operational <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptor</b> for video, the leaky-bucket algorithm appears to be superior to the sliding-window algorithm. And finally, with a delay in the video system, the statistical multiplex-ing gain from VBR over CBR video is upper bounded by roughly a factor of three, and to obtain a gain of 1. 5 to 2. 0 can require the operational <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptor</b> to have a window or bucket size {{on the order of}} a thousand cells. We briefly discuss how increasing the complexity of the video system may enable the size of the bucket or window to be reduced. ...|$|E

40|$|Model-based {{numerical}} analysis {{is an important}} branch of the model-based performance evaluation. Especially state-oriented formalisms and methods based on Markovian processes, like stochastic Petri nets and Markov chains, have been successfully adopted because they are mathematically well understood and allow the intuitive modeling of many processes of the real world. However, these methods {{are sensitive to the}} well-known phenomenon called state space explosion. One way to handle this problem is the decomposition approach. In this thesis, we present a decomposition framework for the analysis of a fairly general class of open and closed queueing networks. The decomposition is done at queueing station level, i. e., the queueing stations are independently analyzed. During the analysis, <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors</b> are exchanged between the stations, representing the streams of jobs flowing between them. Networks with feedback are analyzed using a fixed-point iteration. Based on the decomposition framework, we have developed an efficient analysis method called FiFiQueues. The method supports open queueing networks with infinite and finite capacity queues. We present the method and discuss its fixed-point behavior, as well as various extensions to the original algorithm. We also show how the method can be applied in the efficient analysis of closed queueing networks. The service processes in FiFiQueues can be arbitrary phase-type renewal processes. Over the last decade, traffic measurements have shown the presence of properties such as self-similarity and long-range dependency in network traffic. It has been shown that this {{can be explained by the}} heavy-tailedness of many of the involved distributions. We describe how hyper-exponential distributions, which are a special case of phase-type distributions, can be fitted to heavy-tail distributed measurement data. FiFiQueues' <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors</b> are based on the first and second moment of the inter-arrival time and, hence, cannot account for correlations in the traffic streams. To approach this problem, we also introduce MAPs as <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors.</b> Since a queueing network analysis based on MAP <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors</b> suffers under the state space explosion problem, we present five different MAP reduction methods in order to decrease the effect of the state space explosion...|$|R

It therefore allows an easy and efficient implementation of the CAC function., based only on the sources Mean Rates and Variances as <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors.</b> In order to make these <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors</b> policeable, we propose a Rate Control scheme to enforce the Mean Rate and Variance at the encoder output to comply with LeakyBucket -Like parameters at the network interface. 1.

40|$|Abstract- Estimating correct <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors</b> is an {{important}} issue when deploying IP telephony with quality of service guarantees. Usually, a token bucket is used to police a traffic flow. Such a policer checks (and ensures) that the traffic flow fits inside a traffic envelope. For variable bit rate (VBR) sources normally two traffic envelopes are specified: one dealing with the peak rate and one dealing with the sustainable rate with an associated burst size. These parameters have to be specified when making a reservation with either the resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) in case of IntServ or may be specified in a Service Level Specification (SLS) when using DiffServ. This paper shows how to choose the <b>traffic</b> <b>descriptors</b> for aggregate voice traffic for both constant bit rate sources and sources that use voice activity detection.
