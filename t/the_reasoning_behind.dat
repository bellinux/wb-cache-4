5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, <b>the</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Barbed Wire Massacre at Turning Point between Abyss and Sabu. TNA advertised the Barbed Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19 episode of Impact!. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> the match {{stipulation}} {{had to do}} with Abyss fearing barbed wire in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode of Impact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a barbed wire wrapped steal chair. Sabu defeated Abyss at the event to end their rivalry.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 CECAFA Cup was the 24th {{edition of}} the {{football}} tournament, which involves teams from Southern and Central Africa. The matches were played in Uganda, a decision which Tanzania protested, but to no avail. Tanzania were also banned from international football by FIFA, the world football governing body. The matches were played from 18 November to 2 December 2000. Prior to the tournament, Djibouti withdrew due to monetary difficulties, but re-entered. Sudan and Zanzibar also withdrew, but stayed out. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> their withdrawal was unknown.|$|E

5|$|Use of CS in war is {{prohibited}} {{under the terms}} of the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by most nations in 1993 with all but five other nations signing between 1994 and 1997. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> the prohibition is pragmatic: use of CS by one combatant could easily trigger retaliation with much more toxic chemical weapons such as nerve agents. Only four nations have not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and are therefore unhindered by restrictions on the use of CS gas: Angola, Egypt, North Korea and Somalia.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|George Smith's sister Anne {{married and}} had a son named James Christian McGill (1880–1972). McGill was {{orphaned}} {{at a young age}} when his parents died in the mid-1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised, along with his infant sister Eleanor, by Mrs. Smith and George Smith. Smith was a notoriously reticent and shy individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime, in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters. Consequently, much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil's early life, his rise to fame and <b>the</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> his methods on the track comes from interviews with his nephew, James McGill, who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith's death.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Barbed Wire Massacre at Turning Point between Abyss and Sabu. This match {{was the result}} of a long-standing rivalry between the two that began at Unbreakable. There, Abyss {{defeated}} Sabu in a No Disqualification match. Abyss and Sabu competed in a Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory alongside Jeff Hardy and Rhino, which Rhino won. At Genesis, Abyss defeated Sabu in another No Disqualification match. TNA advertised the Barbed Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> the match stipulation had to do with Abyss fearing barbed wire in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode ofImpact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a barbed wire wrapped steel chair.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E

5|$|In 1173, Saladin sent Turan-Shah {{to conquer}} Yemen and the Hejaz. Muslim writers Ibn al-Athir and later al-Maqrizi wrote that <b>the</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> {{the conquest of}} Yemen was an Ayyubid fear that should Egypt fall to Nur al-Din, they could seek refuge in a faraway territory. In May 1174, Turan-Shah conquered Zabid from a Kharijite dynasty and {{executed}} its leader Mahdi Abd al-Nabi, and later that year Aden {{was taken from the}} Shia Banu Karam tribe. Aden became the principal maritime port of the dynasty in the Indian Ocean and the principal city of Yemen, although the official capital of Ayyubid Yemen was Ta'iz. The advent of the Ayyubids marked the beginning of a period of renewed prosperity in the city which saw the improvement of its commercial infrastructure, the establishment of new institutions, and the minting of its own coins. Following this prosperity, the Ayyubids implemented a new tax which was collected by galleys.|$|E
5|$|Stephen then {{agreed to}} a truce {{proposed}} by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the truce are not known, but the results were that Stephen first released Matilda from the siege and then allowed her and her household of knights to be escorted to the south-west, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> Stephen's decision to release his rival remains unclear. Contemporary chroniclers suggested that Henry argued {{that it would be}} in Stephen's own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, and Stephen may have seen Robert, not the Empress, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Stephen also faced a military dilemma at Arundel—the castle was considered almost impregnable, and he may have been worried that he was tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen was certainly known for having a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E

25|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle {{had served}} as a {{volunteer}} doctor in the Langman Field Hospital at Bloemfontein between March and June 1900. In his widely distributed and translated pamphlet 'The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct' he justified both <b>the</b> <b>reasonings</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> war and handling of the conflict itself. He also pointed out that over 14,000 British soldiers had died of disease during the conflict (as opposed to 8000 killed in combat) and at the height of epidemics he was seeing 50–60 British soldiers dying each day in a single ill-equipped and overwhelmed military hospital.|$|R

25|$|The Lancet in 2006 {{suggested}} that it may take more than 50 years for vCJD to develop, from their studies of kuru, a similar disease in Papua New Guinea. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>behind</b> the claim is that kuru was possibly transmitted through cannibalism in Papua New Guinea when family members would eat {{the body of a}} dead relative as a sign of mourning.

At any rate, he once more packed up his belongings, including his extensive library of ten thousand books, and moved to Paris.|$|E
