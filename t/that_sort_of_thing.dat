500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> and make it compelling.

Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves.

500|$|Cecil {{has said}} that the game's fanbase {{believes}} Dan Brown to have been influenced by Broken Sword when writing his novel, The Da Vinci Code, because of the parallels between the two works. Cecil stated that he is flattered by this sentiment, but that he would never claim so himself due to the threat of Brown's [...] "very serious" [...] lawyers. Joao Diniz Sanches of Pocket Gamer said Broken Sword story is a [...] "tale, some would argue, that effortlessly outclasses Dan Brown's similarly themed and tricksy novel." [...] In an article about Broken Sword, Computer and Video Games described the Knights Templar legend as a [...] "great mythology to base a game on", and noted that Broken Sword [...] "came out years before the Da Vinci Code made <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> popular." ...|$|E
500|$|For 1986, Hill {{planned to}} move up to the British Formula Three Championship with title-winning team West Surrey Racing. The loss of {{sponsorship}} from Ricoh, and then {{the death of his}} proposed team-mate Bertrand Fabi in a testing accident, ended Hill's proposed drive. Hill says [...] "When Bert was killed, I took the conscious decision that I wasn't going to stop doing <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> It's not just competing, it's doing something more exciting. I'm at my fullest skiing, racing or whatever. And I'm more frightened of letting it all slip and reaching 60 and finding I've done nothing." [...] Hill borrowed £100,000 to finance his racing and had a steady first season for Murray Taylor Racing in 1986 before taking a brace of wins in each of the following years for Intersport. He finished third in the 1988 championship.|$|E

500|$|Fellow judge James L. Oakes {{described}} Medina as a {{fair and}} reasonable judge, and wrote that [...] "after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave {{them a little bit}} of their own medicine, too." [...] Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was [...] "unfriendly" [...] to the defense, and that [...] "there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: [...] "If we let them do <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> , they'll destroy the government". According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had {{died of a heart attack}} during the 1943 trial involving the Smith Act. Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.|$|E
500|$|The band is not musically polished. Paul has joked that, if {{they had}} known of the band’s popularity, they might have made [...] "an effort to sing in tune. But it’s hard to {{anticipate}} <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> when you’re just writing silly songs and recording them {{in your living room}} over a weekend.". While musicianship is not the strength of the band, Paul says that the fans [...] "know we're not the best singers and keyboard players, but we're okay. And they think, well, I could do that, too. I think that’s really encouraging to people..." [...] Paul sees the brothers as a [...] "bridge between this mainstream phenomena of Harry Potter and the indie rock underground. Plus, we’re also pretty strong adherents to the DIY ideal." [...] The two brothers promote this ideal of making music independently and have fused the legions of fans on to the DIY free-for-all of indie rock and punk music, albeit of the silly kind.|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing.

That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up.

500|$|In 1923 Fender {{enjoyed his}} best all-round season, scoring 1,427 runs and taking 178 wickets. The former {{was the second}} best {{aggregate}} of his career, the latter his highest total of wickets. Again, there were no Test matches, but Fender played in two Test trials. He was successful in the first match, taking six for 44 and scoring 49 runs, but his performance was overshadowed by continued controversy over the captaincy; Fender was not asked to captain a side in either match. The press questioned why the selectors ignored Fender's captaincy claims even though, {{in the view of}} journalists, he was the most deserving candidate. One writer suggested that Lord's [...] "resented" [...] Fender's success, and that politics prevented his appointment. At that time it was usual for amateurs and professionals to enter the field of play from different gates; Fender's habit was to use the same gate as his professionals. This brought a rebuke for Fender from Lord Harris, who said: [...] "We do not want <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> at Lord's, Fender". Surrey finished fourth in the Championship, hampered once again by their lack of bowlers; their batsmen frequently made large scores but the team could not bowl out the opposition and many games were drawn. Fender's [...] batting continued to be effective, but he demonstrated a more restrained approach and improved his defence. Again, he had a heavy bowling workload given the lack of support, and Wisden said that he bowled with [...] "pronounced spin and variety of device".|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal moved {{three points}} clear {{at the top}} of the Premier League with a 3–1 win at home to Southampton in early December. Against Derby County Vieira scored his first goal for the club to earn Arsenal a point. The team then faced Nottingham Forest, which marked Stuart Pearce debut as {{caretaker}} manager. Arsenal, without Seaman, Adams, Dixon and Vieira, succumbed to a 2–1 defeat, following the dismissal of Wright. The poor form over Christmas continued: Arsenal were held to a goalless draw away to Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day and twice let their lead against Aston Villa slip, in spite of playing [...] "...the best 45 minutes of football the Premiership has seen this season." [...] On New Year's Day, Wright scored his 200th English league goal in Arsenal's 2–0 win against Middlesbrough; he began a three-game suspension thereafter, because of his red card against Nottingham Forest. Disciplinary problems continued to beset the club: Bergkamp's dismissal, in the team's defeat to Sunderland on 11 January 1997, was Arsenal's fifth in ten matches. Wenger admitted the disciplinary record was in danger of damaging their title challenge, adding, [...] "The other strange fact is that three out of five dismissals have been strikers, when <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> normally happens to defenders. To me, that shows our strikers must be taking their fair share of kicks. When teams play Arsenal, the games are physical and we have to defend ourselves." [...] Arsenal kept up with Manchester United and Liverpool with a win over Everton on 19 January 1997; the result kept them three points behind top spot, with a game in hand. At Upton Park, the team recorded their sixth victory in seven visits to West Ham and moved second, behind [...] "the advancing Manchester United".|$|E

500|$|Mystery writer Andrew Klavan, {{writing in}} The Wall Street Journal, {{compared}} the extreme measures that Batman takes to fight crime with those U.S. President George W. Bush {{used in the}} War on Terror. Klavan claims that, [...] "at some level" [...] The Dark Knight is [...] "a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by George W. Bush {{in this time of}} terror and war." [...] Klavan supports this reading of the film by comparing Batman—like Bush, Klavan argues—"sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past." [...] Klavan's article has received criticism on the Internet and in mainstream media outlets, such as in The New Republics [...] "The Plank." [...] Reviewing the film in The Sunday Times, Cosmo Landesman reached the opposite conclusion to Klavan, arguing that The Dark Knight [...] "offers up a lot of moralistic waffle about how we must hug a terrorist– okay, I exaggerate. At its heart, however, is a long and tedious discussion about how individuals and society must never abandon the rule of law in struggling against the forces of lawlessness. In fighting monsters, we must be careful not to become monsters– <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> The film champions the anti-war coalition's claim that, in having a war on terror, you create the conditions for more terror. We are shown that innocent people died because of Batman– and he falls for it." [...] Benjamin Kerstein, writing in Azure, says that both Klavan and Landesman [...] "have a point," [...] because [...] "The Dark Knight is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, {{for the first time in}} decades, an American mainstream no longer exists." ...|$|E
