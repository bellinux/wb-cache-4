50|$|Use of 555- for {{anything}} other than 555-1212 style information numbers raises the problem that call cost is unclear to consumers; in theory, the numbers could be anything from toll-free to premium. This complicates the provision of <b>toll</b> <b>restriction</b> to local subscribers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Toll</b> <b>restriction</b> or toll denial is {{a feature}} offered by {{telephone}} companies which allows {{a line to}} be so programmed {{that it is impossible}} to originate long distance calls from that line, or to accept charges reversed to the number by other parties. Such lines usually allow calls to be made to no-charge numbers locally and toll-free (in North America, area codes 1-800, 1-888, 1-877, 1-866, 1-855 and 1-844), so customers can still make some long-distance calls.|$|E
5000|$|The 830 toll {{barriers}} in Germany cripple domestic traffic and bring {{more or less}} the same results: how if every limb of the human body were bound together, so that blood could not flow from one limb to the other? In order to trade from Hamburg to Austria, from Berlin to the Swiss Cantons, one must cut through the statutes of ten states, study ten tolls and toll barriers, ten times go through the toll barriers, and ten times pay the tolls. Who but the unfortunate has to negotiate such borders? To live with such borders? Where three or four states collide, there one must live his whole life under evil, senseless <b>tolls</b> and <b>toll</b> <b>restrictions.</b> That is no Fatherland! ...|$|R
5000|$|The Copenhagen Convention, {{which came}} into force on 14 March 1857, {{abolished}} the dues and all Danish straits were made international waterways free to all military and commercial shipping. It had been increasingly {{evident that the}} Sound Dues had {{a negative impact on}} the port and merchants of Copenhagen, although the dues delivered by then one eighth of the Danish state income; and the world's seafaring nations were becoming less and less tolerant of these <b>tolls</b> and <b>restrictions.</b> In compensation for the abolition, the Danish state received a one-time fee of 33.5 million Danish rigsdalers, paid to Denmark by the other European shipping nations who signed the Convention. Of the total fee, Great Britain paid approximately one third, and Russia another third. [...] A similar convention between Denmark and the United States, signed in Washington the same year, gave American ships free passage in perpetuity for a one-time fee of $393,000.|$|R
50|$|When {{the smart}} tag is {{installed}} in the vehicle, the car is quickly identified and owner's bank account is automatically deducted. This process is realized at any speed up to over 250 km per hour.If the car {{does not have the}} smart tag, the driver is required to go to a pay station to pay the tolls between 3rd and 5th day after with a surplus charge. If he fails to do so, the owner is sent a letter home with a heavy fine. If this is not paid, it increases five-fold and after that, the car is inserted into a police database for vehicle impounding.This system is also used in some limited access areas of main cities to allow only entry from pre-registered residents. It is planned to be implemented both in more roads and in city entrance <b>toll</b> collection/access <b>restriction.</b> The efficacy of the system is considered to be so high that it is almost impossible for the driver to complain.|$|R
50|$|Most {{commonly}} this restriction {{is applied}} {{at the request}} of the owner of the premises, who does not wish to be subject to unlimited liability for costly unauthorised calls made by others at the site. Restriction of calls to overseas or premium-rate telephone numbers are common options on some systems, such as voice over IP. Private branch exchange clients are often able to configure <b>toll</b> <b>restriction</b> on a per-extension basis through the local PBX, either blocking all trunk calls or requiring that a numeric password be dialled to complete the call.|$|E
40|$|Value pricing {{projects}} {{implemented in}} the U. S. {{during the past decade}} have demonstrated that pricing can be politically and publicly acceptable – so far, four priced lane projects and four variably priced toll facility projects are operating without any significant public or political controversy. On operating projects, pricing keeps congestion from occurring on priced lanes, reduces congestion on toll facilities, changes travel behavior, and improves utilization of existing highway capacity. Revenues from tolls have been used to provide funding for transportation improvements. Yet, issues remain with regard to public attitudes toward projects involving tolls; equity concerns; and political acceptance. Technical issues have also stalled several projects, including high construction costs that limit self-financing capability; access to and egress from priced lanes within freeways; and difficulties with regard to enforcement of <b>toll</b> exemption <b>restrictions</b> for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs) on priced lanes. Private sector involvement in investment and operation of priced lanes has also encountered problems. This paper summarizes the promises and challenges of value pricing, and how the challenges are being addressed in the various projects implemented or under development under the Value Pricing Pilot Program...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{of policies that}} could improve traffic and environmental conditions and reduce energy consumption {{in the city of}} Athens is presented. The analysis is carried out {{with the aid of a}} Decision Support System (DSS) integrated in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Six policies (area restriction for private cars, <b>toll</b> imposing, parking <b>restrictions,</b> bus-lanes, introduction of new fuel technologies for public transport vehicles and fuel taxation) are examined. The policies are evaluated according to their performance for a number of traffic, accessibility, energy and environmental indicators and to their benefits with respect to a Reference State. The results demonstrate that fuel taxation, area traffic restriction and parking restriction have substantial benefits, especially when applied in a large area. 2...|$|R
500|$|The Borough of Leeds {{was created}} in 1207, when Maurice Paynel, Lord of the Manor, granted a charter to the {{inhabitants}} of the town of Leeds. They were created [...] "burgesses", and were given the right to hold half an acre of land, trade as they liked, and transport their goods by land or water, subject to <b>tolls</b> and <b>restrictions</b> paid to the manor. The only officer of the borough was a praetor, appointed annually at the Feast of Pentecost by the Lord of the Borough. The praetor had the duty of administering justice and collecting fines and other revenues. The borough formed only a small area adjacent to a crossing of the River Aire, between the old settlement centred on Leeds Parish Church to the east and the manor house and mills to the west. The borough consisted of a single street with approximately thirty burgage plots. [...] By the seventeenth century the title of praetor had been abandoned in favour of the more customary [...] "bailiff", but otherwise the government of the town remained in the form introduced in the thirteenth century. An enquiry into the administration of local charities in 1620 disclosed that many of the funds were diverted by the bailiff for his private use. This, and other irregularities, led the inhabitants of Leeds to petition Charles I for a charter of incorporation.|$|R
40|$|We study {{interaction}} between the trips of two types of drivers on a two-lane road who differ by their desired speeds. The difference in desired speeds causes congestion, because slow drivers force fast drivers to reduce their speed. An interesting aspect {{of this type of}} congestion is that results with respect to tolling are very {{different from those of the}} classical Pigou-Knight model where the marginal external costs are an increasing function of the number of road users. In our model we find the opposite result: the marginal external costs of slow drivers are a decreasing function of the number of slow drivers. This leads to rather different policy recommendations. In many situations either laissez faire (no <b>tolling</b> or traffic <b>restrictions)</b> or prohibition of slow drivers to enter the road is in practice (i. e. taking into account costs associated with tolling) the optimal policy. This conclusion hardly changes if the possibility of overtaking is introduced into the model. * Departmen [...] ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{establishment}} of Drosophila embryonic dorsal-ventral (DV) polarity relies on serine proteolytic {{activity in the}} perivitelline space between the embryonic membrane and the eggshell [1]. Gastrulation Defective cleaves and activates Snake, which processes and activates Easter, which cleaves Spätzle to form the activating ligand for the <b>Toll</b> receptor. Ventral <b>restriction</b> of ligand formation depends on the Pipe sulfotransferase, which is expressed in ventral cells of the follicular epithelium surrounding the developing oocyte [2]. Pipe modifies components of the developing eggshell to produce a ventral cue embedded in the vitelline membrane [3]. This ventral cue is believed to promote {{one or more of}} the proteolysis steps in the perivitelline space. By examining the processing of transgenic, tagged versions of the perivitelline proteins during DV patterning, we find that the proteolysis of Easter by Snake is the first Pipe-dependent step and therefore the key ventrally restricted event in the protease cascade. We also find that Snake and Easter associate together in a complex in both wild-type and pipe mutant-derived embryos. This observation suggests a mechanism in which the sulfated target of Pipe promotes a productive interaction between Snake and Easter, perhaps by facilitating conformational changes in a complex containing the two proteins...|$|R
25|$|In 1970, the {{government}} enacted new federal air pollution regulations. Since New York City was {{in violation of}} these new regulations, it was given until 1975 to be compliant; this was later pushed back to 1977 after the state was given a 2-year delay in implementing the standards. Mayor Lindsay and the federal Environmental Protection Agency developed a plan to collect tolls on twelve free bridges across the Harlem and East Rivers, banning midtown parking, and significantly {{reducing the number of}} parking spaces south of 59th Street. They also proposed to retrofit air filtering devices on cars entering New York City's main business districts. The successive mayor, Abraham Beame, refused to implement the plan, even after federal order in 1975, but environmentalists received a court order in 1976 to proceed with implementation. Yet as the federal legislature forbade the bridge <b>tolls</b> and taxi <b>restrictions</b> went into effect, the parking ban remained the most controversial and consequential aspect of the act, and its forced implementation was poorly executed. In April 1977, Beame's administration released a report that opposed the addition of tolls, a proposal that future Mayor Michael Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan would address thirty years later. The report supported a bill in the New York State Legislature that, if passed, would permanently ban tolls on the East River bridges. Although such a plan would generate revenue for the city, the administration concluded that tolling the free crossings would cause congestion and pollution without enticing drivers to use public transportation. The state departments of environment and transportation concurred with Beame's position, and in a May 1977 report, recommended that tolls not be enacted, {{despite the fact that the}} pollution standards had yet to be met.|$|R
40|$|The heroic role of {{the agent}} called "government" in the simple public-goods model is clear enough, but the {{relevance}} of the model is still in dispute. A long history of doubters have challenged the premises that the government has the needed information, acts efficiently, and acts in the public interest. Also, doubters have contended that the free-rider problem of many public goods is not as ineluctable as others often seem to suggest. Historical studies have shown the potency of voluntary association in such fields as lighthouse provision [Coase 1974], education [Ellig & High 1988], bee pollination [Cheung, 1973], law and order [Anderson & Hill, 1979; Benson, forthcoming], neighborhood infrastructure [Beito, forthcoming], agricultural research [Majewski, 1989], among others [see Cowen, 1988; Wooldridgge, 1970]. To help weigh {{the relevance of the}} simple public-goods model I discuss the American experience of private turnpike roads. Extreme publicness marked the turnpikes, both in jointness of consumption and in nonexcludability. The excludability problem was partly the result of legal <b>restrictions</b> on <b>toll</b> collection. These <b>restrictions</b> caused in part turnpike unprofitability, which was discovered quickly. The turnpikes afforded enormous indirect and external benefits, however, to the nearby farms, landholdings, and businesses. Since unprofitability was usually foreseen, stock subscription [...] necessary to construct the road [...] was essentially a means of paying for road benefits. There were two excludability problems: people could use the road without paying a toll, and people could indirectly benefit from the road without buying stock. Though related, the latter is the crux of the public-goods problem at hand. The turnpike companies got started in the 1790 s and were in sharp decline in the 1830 s, though many turnpikes were operating at the turn of our century. I treat turnpikes in New England, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (the last four I call the "Middle Atlantic states"). Except in Pennsylvania, the turnpikes were almost entirely financed by private subscription to stock, while those in most other states were mixed enterprises. Various facets of toll-road history are being explored by a co-researcher and myself, but here the discussion is confined to the public-goods aspect of the turnpikes...|$|R
