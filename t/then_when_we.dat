The basic rule is that if we have the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at A and B ending at C and D. The amplitude would be calculated as the [...] "difference", , where we would expect, from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think {{it took us a}} while to find it but I think we found the right song." [...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] to be something that people didn't expect and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Roberto Orci explained {{in an interview that}} the big reveal {{at the end of the}} episode, in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe, was actually planned for a fourth season, but the writers decided [...] "let's actually answer something instead and not get, not just rely on that mystery forever. And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended". The writers wanted to use an iconic image [...] for the scene, leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg's suggestion of the Twin Towers. Wyman first thought it was [...] "the greatest idea in the world" [...] before having doubts that its use would [...] "sensationalize" [...] it. He explained, [...] "But <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started thinking about it, we thought collectively America really understood 9/11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn’t exploited but indicative of the times we’re living in right now. We used it and that was the end of the first season and then we were all really thrilled with where it was going." [...] The cast would later recollect on the series, and for Jackson, considered that the show has never [...] "had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger" [...] as this finale.|$|E

2500|$|Consider if the {{original}} fact were stated as [...] "ab=0 implies a=0 or b=0." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> say [...] "suppose abc=0," [...] {{we have a}} conflict of terms when we substitute. Yet the above logic is still valid to show that if abc=0 then a=0 or b=0 or c=0 if instead of letting a=a and b=bc we substitute a for a and b for bc (and with bc=0, substituting b for a and c for b). This shows that substituting for the terms in a statement isn't always the same as letting the terms from the statement equal the substituted terms. In this situation it's clear that if we substitute an expression a into the a term of {{the original}} equation, the a substituted does not refer to the a in the statement [...] "ab=0 implies a=0 or b=0." ...|$|E
2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album. Einziger stated that the song was {{conceived}} in 2009 with Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band and [...] "was written {{at a time when}} I didn’t know whether or not {{we were going to go}} back and start working on new music for a new album. I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of just put it aside and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great. But that actually was one of the last things that we did for this album." ...|$|E

But <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had to do the interviews about it, we said [...] "Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about.

Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.|$|E
2500|$|The song's melody {{grew out}} of some {{unstructured}} jamming on 7 January 1969 during rehearsal sessions on the sound stage at Twickenham Studios. Over the next few minutes, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking [...] "Get back to the place you should be" [...] from fellow Beatle George Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] into [...] "Get back to where you once belonged". McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax's recording of [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] a few months earlier. On 9 January McCartney brought a more developed version of [...] "Get Back" [...] to the group, with the [...] "Sweet Loretta" [...] verse close to its finished version. For the press release to promote the [...] "Get Back" [...] single, McCartney wrote, [...] "We {{were sitting in the}} studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and <b>then...</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{production}} on Kingdom of the Sun, Andreas Deja was the initial supervising animator of Yzma, and incorporated supermodeling poses published in magazines {{in order to}} capture Yzma's sultry, seductive persona.

According to Pruiksma, Snowball was [...] "a silly, vain and egotistical character, rather the dumb blond of the llama set.
