40|$|This paper {{examines}} the highway safety {{implications of the}} 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) which, among its provisions, increased minimum truck lengths and maximum truck widths; required states to allow twin trailers; and barred states from reducing existing weight and size limits if these exceeded the limitations specified in the STAA.

40|$|In East Africa, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} concerns over logistics efficiency. Among them, the regional integration of the trucking industry is perceived as a major problem. This paper utilizes a combination of unpublished data surveys and published data (mainly port data) to assess the extent of regional integration. Based on various types of data, several main messages can be drawn from the trucking industry: there has been a noticeable reduction in the price of long-distance trucking services along the Northern Corridor (the corridor from Mombasa, Kenya, to Uganda/Rwanda/Burundi/eastern DRC); the integration of trucking services is moving fast in East Africa (along the Northern Corridor), Rwanda having a three-quarters market share of foreign-owned trucks; <b>trucking</b> <b>fleet</b> characteristics and management have improved tremendously and are now comparable to those in South Africa; the facilitation of border clearance processes has {{played a major role in}} improving fleet productivity.

40|$|Abstract: In some cases, {{complementary}} {{products are}} sold to {{different sets of}} agents to aid in transactions between them. In {{the context of a}} simplified model, this paper shows that a monopolist has an incentive to integrate into and foreclose other sellers of a complementary product used in fixed proportions with the monopolized product, but which is sold to different consumers. While these latter consumers are made worse off by integration and leverage, output is expanded and the monopolist’s original consumers are made better-off. The effect of integration and leverage on overall welfare is uncertain. I illustrate this model with an example involving <b>trucking</b> <b>fleet</b> cards (sold to trucking companies) and fuel desk point-of-sale systems (sold to truck stops) that are used in conjunction when diesel fuel is purchased. 1 The views expressed in this paper are the author’s, not necessarily those of the Federal Trade Commission or any individual Commissioner.

40|$|There {{are large}} {{economic}} and societal costs to commercial motor vehicle crashes. A majority of crashes are precipitated due to driver-related factors. Behavior-based systems that influence drivers with feedback from safety managers {{can help reduce}} driver-related risk factors. These systems harness the experience and knowledge of managers along with advanced driver telematics that monitor and record driver behaviors to positively influence driver safety. Safety solutions that focus on modifying driver behaviors thus hold promise for improving the safety record of commercial trucking. In this study, one such feedback system was examined by analyzing data from a commercial <b>trucking</b> <b>fleet,</b> treating the system deployment as a natural experiment. This made it possible, without experimental intervention, to compare drivers before and after system introduction, and to compare drivers that were subject to this system with those that drove with no supervisor feedback. Adverse event data were obtained for drivers in the fleet and weekly event rates were calculated taking into account driving exposure (in miles). Results show that drivers improved after receiving safety feedback and significantly more so than drivers that did not receive feedback...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formally}} introduce a generic real-time multi-vehicle truckload pick-up and delivery problem. The problem includes {{the consideration of}} various costs associated with trucks ’ empty travel distances, jobs ’ delayed completion times, and job rejections. Although very simple, the problem captures most features of the operational problem of a real-world <b>trucking</b> <b>fleet</b> that dynamically moves truckloads between different sites according to customer requests that arrive continuously over time. We propose a mixed integer programming formulation for the off-line version of the problem. We then consider and compare five rolling horizon strategies for the real-time version. Two of the policies {{are based on a}} repeated reoptimization of various instances of the off-line problem, while the others use simpler local (heuristic) rules. One of the re-optimization strategies is new while the other strategies have recently been tested for similar real-time fleet management problems. The comparison of the policies is done under a general simulation framework. The analysis is systematic and consider varying traffic intensities, varying degrees of advance information, and varying degrees of flexibility for job rejection decisions. The new re-optimization policy is shown to systematically outperform the others under all these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Freight Wing Incorporated {{utilized}} the opportunity presented by a DOE category two Inventions and Innovations grant to commercialize and improve upon aerodynamic technology for semi-tuck trailers, capable of decreasing heavy vehicle fuel consumption, related environmental damage, and U. S. consumption of foreign oil. Major project goals included {{the demonstration of}} aerodynamic trailer technology in <b>trucking</b> <b>fleet</b> operations, and the development and testing of second generation products. A great deal of past scientific {{research has demonstrated that}} streamlining box shaped semi-trailers can significantly reduce a truck’s fuel consumption. However, significant design challenges have prevented past concepts from meeting industry needs. Freight Wing utilized a 2003 category one Inventions and Innovations grant to develop practical solutions to trailer aerodynamics. Fairings developed for the front, rear, and bottom of standard semi-trailers together demonstrated a 7 % improvement to fuel economy in scientific tests conducted by the Transportation Research Center (TRC). Operational tests with major trucking fleets proved the functionality of the products, which were subsequently brought to market. This category two grant enabled Freight Wing to further develop, test and commercialize its products, resulting in greatly increased understanding and acceptance of aerodynamic trailer technology. Commercialization was stimulated by offering trucking fleets 50 % cost sharing on trial implementations of Freight Wing products for testing and evaluation purposes. Over 230 fairings were implemented through the program with 35 trucking fleets including industry leaders such as Wal-Mart, Frito Lay and Whole Foods. The feedback from these testing partnerships was quite positive with product performance exceeding fleet expectations in many cases. Fleet feedback also was also valuable from a product development standpoint and assisted the design of several second generation products intended to further improve efficiency, lower costs, and enhance durability. Resulting products demonstrated a 30 % efficiency improvement in full scale wind tunnel tests. The fuel savings of our most promising product, the “Belly Fairing” increased from 4 % to 6 % in scientific track and operational tests. The project successfully demonstrated the economic feasibility of trailer aerodynamics and positioned the technology to realize significant public benefits. Scientific testing conducted with partners such as the EPA Smartway program and Transport Canada clearly validated the fuel and emission saving potential of the technology. The Smartway program now recommends trailer aerodynamics as a certified fuel saving technology and is offering incentives such as low interest loans. Trailer aerodynamics can save average trucks over 1, 100 gallons of fuel an 13 tons of emissions every 100, 000 miles, a distance many trucks travel annually. These fuel savings produce a product return on investment period of one to two years in average fleet operations. The economic feasibility of the products was validated by participating fleets, several of which have since completed large implementations or demonstrated an interest in volume orders. The commercialization potential of the technology was also demonstrated, resulting in a national distribution and manufacturing partnership with a major industry supplier, Carrier Transicold. Consequently, Freight Wing is well positioned to continue marketing trailer aerodynamics to the trucking industry. The participation of leading fleets in this project served to break down the market skepticism that represents a primary barrier to widespread industry utilization. The benefits of widespread utilization of the technology could be quite significant for both the transportation industry and the public. Trailer aerodynamics could potentially save the U. S. <b>trucking</b> <b>fleet</b> over a billion gallons of fuel and 20 million tons of emissions annually...|$|E
40|$|Under {{contract}} to the DOE Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies, the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is developing and evaluating pneumatic (blown) aerodynamic devices {{to improve the}} performance, economics, stability and safety of operation of Heavy Vehicles. The objective of this program is to apply the pneumatic aerodynamic aircraft technology previously developed and flight-tested by GTRI personnel {{to the design of}} an efficient blown tractor-trailer configuration. Recent experimental results obtained by GTRI using blowing have shown drag reductions of 35 % on a streamlined automobile wind-tunnel model. Also measured were lift or down-load increases of 100 - 150 % and the ability to control aerodynamic moments about all 3 axes without any moving control surfaces. Similar drag reductions yielded by blowing on bluff afterbody trailers in current US <b>trucking</b> <b>fleet</b> operations are anticipated to reduce yearly fuel consumption by more than 1. 2 billion gallons, while even further reduction is possible using pneumatic lift to reduce tire rolling resistance. Conversely, increased drag and down force generated instantaneously by blowing can greatly increase braking characteristics and control in wet/icy weather due to effective ''weight'' increases on the tires. Safety is also enhanced by controlling side loads and moments caused on these Heavy Vehicles by winds, gusts and other vehicles passing. This may also help to eliminate the jack-knifing problem if caused by extreme wind side loads on the trailer. Lastly, reduction of the turbulent wake behind the trailer can reduce splash and spray patterns and rough air being experienced by following vehicles. To be presented by GTRI in this paper will be results developed during the early portion of this effort, including a preliminary systems study, CFD prediction of the blown flowfields, and design of the baseline conventional tractor-trailer model and the pneumatic wind-tunnel model...|$|E
