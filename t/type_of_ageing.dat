40|$|International audienceThe {{comparison}} between physical properties and chemical structures of several polysiloxanes was studied at initial state and upon ageings. Techniques such as densimetry, gel permeation chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravim- etric analysis coupled with IR spectroscopy {{and the new}} tool photo-DSC were used to give assessments of average mo- lecular weight, chemical evolution, cristallinity and thermal stability. Different types of ageing such as thermal ageing (60 °C and 100 °C), photo-ageing and acid vapour ageing were performed. After ageing we observed an evolution of chemical structures and physical properties for all samples. The main pathway of degradation is given for each sample. It results in oxidation, chain scission or cross-linking. Cross-linking levels are dependant on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing,</b> the chemical structure and the initial rate of cristallinity. Cross-linking reactions are favoured after photo-ageing. Oxidation is higher for polysiloxane with aliphatic carbon chain...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the e¤ects {{of reducing}} unfunded {{social security and}} population ageing on economic growth and welfare, both for a small open economy and for a closed economy. The economy consists of a service sector and a commodity sector. Productivity growth only occurs in the latter sector and is assumed to depend positively on its size. It is shown that if old agents mainly demand labour intensive services, a decrease of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension scheme reduces long-run growth and thus welfare in a small open economy, whereas current generations are better o¤. However, reducing social security raises productivity growth in a closed economy, both in the short and long run. Furthermore, ageing {{will lead to a}} lower long-run rate of economic growth in a small open economy, whereas in the short run, the e¤ects depend on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> {{and the size of the}} PAYG-scheme.

40|$|Different {{artificial}} ageing treatments {{were applied to}} fresh incinerator bottom ash {{with the aim of}} promoting/accelerating the natural reactions occurring over time on the mineral phases in the material. The weathering treatments included accelerated carbonation, treatment with air and treatment with nitrogen gas. Both fresh and treated bottom ashes were characterized for their mineralogical composition, acid neutralization capacity and leaching behavior of metals. The results were compared to those obtained from similar characterization of bottom ash samples weathered under atmospheric conditions for 4 years. The findings from the experimental campaign indicated that both the release of metals and the type of solubility-controlling solid phases varied {{as a function of the}} duration and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> treatment.

40|$|Bitumen ageing plays a {{significant}} role in determining the resistance of asphalt mixes to fatigue cracking. Regardless of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> (oxidation during manufacture or during the service life), hardening effects increase the risk of cracking. The objective of this work is to examine the combined effect of the loss of volatiles and oxidation produced during ageing on the fatigue behaviour of the bitumen. To this end, different types of bitumen were subjected to accelerated ageing in the laboratory, simulating long-term ageing (RTFOT + PAV). They were then subjected to traditional tests (penetration, softening point, Fraass fragility point, dynamic viscosity, etc.), Dynamic Shear Rheometer tests (frequency and temperature sweep), and the EBADE test (a fatigue strain sweep test at different temperatures). Different temperatures have been used to evaluate the effect of visco-elastic phenomena on aged binder fatigue. The results showed that, in terms of their response to ageing, modified binders show a higher rate of variation in their general properties than conventional binders. In addition, it was shown that temperature {{plays an important role in}} the impact of ageing on the fatigue response of bituminous binders, and in the same way, in the mechanical response of these materials.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of commercially available hot-melt adhesive,HMA,which is mostly used in automotive applications,have been studied under different environmental and loading conditions, paying {{particular attention to}} the ageing effects. Three laboratory accelerated ageing processes were applied to single lap joints (SLJs) of two polypropylene substrates in order to replicate the least favourable environmental conditions in automotive usage. Experimental parametric studies were performed on virgin and aged specimens,investigating the influence of two design factors, the overlap length and adhesive layer thickness,on the load carrying capacity and mode of failure of the SLJ. FT-IR was used to perform qualitative HMA polymer composition analyses. The DSC test was also performed to obtain the thermal behaviour,and the phase transition temperatures of the HMA. In addition,the sliding temperature test was performed in an electronically controlled climatic chamber to understand, by means of tests on SLJs, the temperature resistance of the HMA/polypropylene bonded systems. Results clearly show that depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> process,the strength of SLJ basedon HMAs varies, this enhances a relevant difference with respect to the strength of SLJ based on conventional thermosetting adhesive.

40|$|Sun light, {{especially}} the short-wave ultra-violet {{part of the}} sun spectrum, together with influence of moisture, are the most enlarged and the most effective sources of climatic damage of polymers. The effects of the both influences became stronger with enhanced temperature. Sun light {{on the one hand}} supports the forming of transverse chemical bonds between macromolecules {{and on the other hand}} results in their breakdown. This causes a strengthening or softening of polymers. The amount of changes and the dominant process depends on the radiation dose and on the influencing wave length. Every kind of chemical bond has its own critical wave length, which, with sufficient amount of energy, brings a reaction. Ageing, as a result of climatic loading, is therefore very closely connected with a structure of a real material. Microindentation is one of possible methods for assessing influences of a climatic loading on mechanical properties of polymers. Indentation test is checked by the history either of a power or an indent depth. The information about the hardness, Young modulus and viscoelastic properties of the investigated material can be received afterwards from measured data. The investigated materials were tested in their native standard form and also after four model types of physical-chemical ageing. Time-dependent properties of the sealants were assessed by the method of indentation creep.

40|$|Photo- and thermo-oxidative {{degradation}} of several dyes, additives and pure cellulose paper, were examined mainly by photo-induced chemiluminescence (PICL) technique. The degradation levels were assessed based on free radical populations of irradiated samples. The chromatic alteration {{of the samples}} {{as a result of}} accelerated ageing treatments conducted in the study were carried out by measuring CIELAB parameters (L*, a*, b* and ΔE*) using spectrophotometry method. The chemical and physical changes of pure cellulose paper during accelerated ageing was characterised by ATR-FTIR and UV–visible spectroscopic methods. The spectra were focused between 1500 – 1900 cm– 1, where the products of paper ageing appear in the form of various carbonyl groups. Dyes and additives may accelerate or inhibit photo{{degradation of}} materials by increasing or reducing free radicals. PICL intensity emissions of dyes were found to be dependent on the dye class and chromophore and do not relate to the lightfastness rating of dyes. Higher PICL intensity emissions than a control is associated with lower photostability of samples. The application of UV absorbers, Rayosan C on cotton and Cibafast W on silk, provided efficient photo-protection against the damaging effects of light. The application of the antioxidants, ascorbic acid on cotton and a combination of N-acetyl/oxalic acid on silk provided effective photo-protection by reducing free radicals and inhibiting oxidation reactions. Doping fluorescein dye, eosin Y dye and a photoinitiator into methyl cellulose or ethyl cellulose polymer films successfully accelerated the photooxidation of these polymer films under visible light irradiation. Incorporation of these additives into polymer films, promote free radical oxidation, to enable rapid photo-oxidation of waste polymers in the environment. Study of photo- and thermal ageing of pure cellulose paper showed that colour and chemical changes depend on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> treatment carried out. Under the current experimental conditions, UVB ageing had the most contributors to colour and chemical change. However, free radical population of these samples was similar to unaged sample as detected by PICL technique. The ATR-FTIR transmission spectra showed a higher absorbance in the carbonyl range (1900 – 1500 cm– 1) and at extended exposure stages, a shift of frequency vibrations from 1650 cm– 1 to 1730 cm– 1 was observed, indicating the formation of carboxylic groups. Results from PICL experiments showed that free radical oxidation may not be the dominant factor contributing to the photodegradation and photoyellowing of cellulose paper...|$|E

The samples analyzed {{in this study were}} collected from the Egyptian Museum of Turin, Italy. The discovery of the studied archaeological finds was made by Ernesto Schiaparelli (1906 until 1913) and the archaeological founds were dated from the late III millenium b. C. to early II millenium b. C. The sites of finding were in Assiut (at about 400 Km from Cairo {{on the bank of the}} Nile) and Gebelein (south of Assiut), near the southern border with Nubia. In the sarcophagus usually it is possible to find weapons, like bows and arrows, textiles and also ointments. Here the results of the vibrational spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman microscopy (laser 632 nm), FT-Raman spectroscopy (laser 1064 nm) and FT-IR/ATR with a golden gate accessory are reported. These techniques are identified as the most suitable ones for the first approach to ancient samples analysis. Raman microscopy is in fact the most suitable technique in order to identify minor inorganic components and contaminants at the micrometric scale inside these complex matrices 4. This technique can easily identify compounds like lead oxide, vermillion, rare minerals, (etc.) that could give interesting informations about the provenance of the raw materials and the original composition of the formulate.

Tipizacija koja se temelji na bodovnoj vrijednosti ima sedam tipova (stupnjeva) ostarjelosti: 1 – na pragu starenja, 2 – starenje, 3 – starost, 4 – duboka starost, 5 – vrlo duboka starost, 6 – izrazito duboka starost i 7 – krajnje duboka starost. Seoska populacija Hrvatske bodovana je sa 66, 5 bodova, što znači da 2011. godine prema stupnju ostarjelosti pripada 4. tipu – duboka starost. Izračun za gradsku populaciju Hrvatske daje 67, 0 bodova, što znači da također pripada 4. tipu – duboka starost. U Hrvatskoj je nastupila zrela posttranzicijska faza u promjeni dobnog sastava; obilježavaju je kontrakcija mlade skupine i ekspanzija stare (na djelu je poodmakli stupanj demografskog starenja) te smanjenje razlika među funkcionalnim skupinama stanovništva. Gube se tako i razlike između gradskog i seoskog stanovništva; obje populacije obilježava jednako visoki stupanj ostarjelosti. Ni među županijama razlike nisu velike, a glavnina je smještena unutar dva razreda; seosko stanovništvo četrnaest županija pripada 4. tipu, a pet županija 5. tipu. Najnepovoljnije je stanje u Ličko-senjskoj županiji, u kojoj seosko stanovništvo pripada 6. tipu. U čak 45 % administrativnih jedinica (od ukupno 556) stanovništvo seoskih naselja zahvaćeno je vrlo visokim stupnjem ostarjelosti (tipovi 5, 6 i 7). Ostale administrativno-teritorijalne jedinice uglavnom pripadaju 4. tipu (37, 9 %) i 3. tipu ostarjelosti (16, 5 %). Nedvojbeno je da su {{hrvatska}} sela demografski opustošena.

Može li selo računati na doseljavanje iz grada kada i samo gradsko stanovništvo boluje od depopulacije, denataliteta i demografskog starenja?One of {{the basic}} demographic characteristics of Croatia is the inherited dispersed population density {{with a large number}} of small settlements and the undeveloped system of regional and micro-regional centres. Such settlement structure was entirely inappropriate in the conditions of accelerated and urban-based industrialization after the Second World War. This period was characterised by a mass transition of agricultural population into non-agricultural activities, along with the abandonment of rural settlements. In addition to the strong emigration from rural areas in which younger age groups participated for the most part, there was a continuous reduction in fertility, too. All this has led to the narrowing of young age groups and consequently to the increase in the proportion of the elderly. An important factor of demographic ageing is the reduction in mortality of persons over 30 years of age and longer life respectively. Life expectancy of the Croatian population was 64. 8 years in 1960 and 77. 2 years in 1972. The average age constantly increased: it was 32. 5 years in 1961, 35. 4 in 1981 and it reached the high 41. 7 years in 2011. The aggression and war against Croatia happened in the 1990 s. Dramatic events affected the general social conditions and processes, strongly accelerating negative demographic trends. All this had further affected the socio-demographically eroded rural areas. There was a particularly difficult situation in the regions directly affected by the war; part of these areas had had the features of extreme demographic regression before the war sufferings and the war only further strengthened it. The overall population of Croatia is characterised by decreasing fertility, natural depopulation (negative natural change), total depopulation (since 1990) and intense population ageing. The duration and intensity of these processes clearly testifies to the demographic development of Croatia being very unfavourable. All this also applies to the rural areas comprising 86 % of the area in which 38 % of the population of Croatia lived in 2011. An ageing point value model is used in the paper; it scores individual proportions of young and old age groups, and sums these values to obtain a point value indicator of population ageing. The proportion of young people (0 - 19 years) is scored in the range from 0. 0 to 30. 0 points; consequently, a larger proportion of youth is scored a greater number of points. The share of the elderly (60 years and over) is rated from 0. 0 to 70. 0 points, but so that the larger proportion of the elderly means fewer points (the other way round than scoring the youth share). The main methodological question was how to determine rural settlements. The set was formed {{in such a way that}} official urban settlements (143 cities) and a group of smaller urbanized settlements (mostly with more than 2000 inhabitants) were omitted from the total settlement set (6756 settlements according to the 2011 Census); the general issue was about urbanized municipal centres and suburban areas of major cities. Accordingly a set of 6508 rural settlements was defined. Previous studies have confirmed utter depopulation of non-urban settlements in Croatia. In the 1971 – 2001 period the population of a set of non-urban settlements decreased by nearly 20 %. At the same time the overall population in Croatia recorded a weak population growth, almost a stagnation (index 103. 8 refers to the “population in the country”). Data for the last inter-census period (2001 – 2011) showed the continuation of the trend of population decline. Croatia has been affected by depopulation as a whole (index of population change 96. 6); urban settlements have a slight decrease in the number of inhabitants (index 98. 5), while rural settlements register almost twice stronger depopulation of Croatia in general (index 93. 6). In terms of cause and effect depopulation is strongly associated with other demographic processes. The ageing of the population (demographic ageing) is the most pronounced process in Croatia and it refers to an increase in the proportion of the population aged 60 and over or 65 and older in the total population. More than three decades ago, a survey claimed that the villages ceased to be a “population incubator” of Croatia. The number of young people aged 0 - 19 years was almost halved in rural areas between 1961 and 2001, it reduced by 46 %! In 1981, the share of elderly people of 60 and over in these settlements was 18. 4 %, and in 2011 it amounted to 24. 9 % (Croatia 24. 1 %, urban population 23. 6 %), while the share of the aged 65 and over was 18, 8 % (Croatia 17. 7 %, urban population 17. 1 %). Consequently, the rural and total population of Croatia have a very similar composition of the population by age – significantly more old than young people. This is also reflected in the average age: 42. 0 years in rural population, 41. 6 years in urban population and 41. 7 in the total population of Croatia. We can affirm that the total population of Croatia, as well as its parts – urban and rural population, has been characterized by a very unfavorable age structure type. At the time of the census of 2011, there were 556 administrative-territorial units (127 administrative cities and 429 municipalities) in Croatia. All municipalities and administrative cities in Croatia have been affected by some degree of demographic ageing. Therefore, even in the case of rural settlements, the need to establish the degree of ageing is naturally understandable. The previously mentioned ageing point value model was used in this purpose; hence, there are seven types (degrees) of ageing: type 1 (90. 5 – 100. 0 points) – on the threshold of old age, 2 (84. 5 – 90. 0) – ageing, 3 (73. 0 – 84. 0) – old age, 4 (65. 5 – 72. 5) – very old age, 5 (50. 5 – 65. 0) – advanced old age, 6 (30. 5 – 50. 0) – very advanced old age, 7 (0. 0 – 0. 0) – extremely advanced old age. It is obvious that population with a lower number of points has a higher degree of ageing and vice versa. The rural population in Croatia scored 66. 5 points, which means that it fell under the fourth <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> – very old age in 2011. The calculation for the urban population in Croatia yields 67. 0 points, meaning that it also fell into the fourth type – very old age. The fact that the degree of rural population ageing almost equals that of the urban population is very significant. A mature post-transition phase in the change of the age structure has occurred in Croatia. It is marked by the contraction of the young group and expansion of the old one (it is a question of the advanced stage of demographic ageing), and the decrease in differences between functional population groups. In this way differences between urban and rural population disappear since they both are marked by an equal degree of ageing. This fact is particularly important in considering demographic stabilisation policy of rural areas. They cannot count on significant immigration from the city as the urban population itself “is suffering” from depopulation, natural decrease and demographic ageing. There are no big differences between Croatian counties as well; the majority is placed within the two classes. Rural population falls under the fourth type - very old age in fourteen counties, and in five under the type 5 – advanced old age. The least favourable situation is in the Lika-Senj County because its rural population is classified into the sixth type – very old advanced age. Only slightly poor situation is to be found in Međimurje County whose rural population falls under the third type – old age. Although the overall picture is more or less expected, the fact that in no less than 45 % of administrative units (administrative cities and municipalities) the population of rural settlements has been affected by a very high level of ageing, still astounds (types: 5 – advanced old age, 6 – very advanced old age and 7 – extremely advanced old age). Rural population in other administrative-territorial units mostly fall into type 4 – very old age (37. 9 %) and type 3 – old age (16. 5 %). The fact that the rural population of any administrative-territorial units is not classified into the 1 st type - on the threshold of old age, and only in one municipality it falls under the 2 nd type - ageing shows to which extent demographic ageing has been an advanced and extensive process. If we separate out the municipalities/administrative cities with the rural population on a very high degree of population ageing (types 5, 6 and 7) from the presented basic map, an unbroken belt from central Dalmatian coast to Žumberak and Banovina can be clearly seen. It is an area of “socio-demographic depression” that has long been affected by the rural exodus and depopulation, and largely exposed to direct war casualties during the 1990 s. As expected, the population of rural settlements of almost all island municipalities/cities also falls into the set with a very high level of ageing. We can affirm that the issue here is the homogenisation of the Croatian rural area in the direction of the increasingly higher degree of ageing. The permanent erosion of generations, the long-term reductions in fertility and the ageing open a series of hard-to-solve existential and other problems. Croatian rural areas are becoming a community of elderly households without the young and heirs. This is undoubtedly a limiting factor in the development of rural settlements which leads to a further deepening of inequality between rural areas and cities. In most cases the aged farmers are the last residents in many villages and with their extinction many of the villages will remain only geographical terms. What should be done to at least mitigate harmful consequences of demographic ageing and depopulation of rural settlements? For this purpose general economic progress and more equal regional development are of crucial importance. Therefore it is necessary, on the basis of scientifically reasoned, comprehensive and interdisciplinary spatial planning, to “choose” the settlements with the most favourable characteristics (location, economic and demographic) with the aim to become local hubs of settlement network. These should be settlements that can relatively quickly develop central functions (with the support of the wider community, of course) and thus meet the basic needs of the population of the surrounding villages. The Croatian settlement structure is missing just such rural centres with around 200 inhabitants (and the current ones are unevenly distributed). In this way the difficulties arising from excessive dispersion of settlements would be minimized and enabled a better quality of life. This is one of the general development measures preventing a complete depopulation of large rural areas. Among the measures to lessen the effects of population ageing, and to improve the age structure respectively, encouraging fertility is in the first place in the population policy domain. Focused on the total population, this measure would have a certain effect even in those villages that have (bio) reproductive base at least at the general population level. These are generally larger villages, located along the major roads and with good accessibility to major urban centres. The implementation of incentive population policy (pro-birth and immigration variants alike) will have to come to the forefront of national interests. Then we will be able to talk about a possible demographic recovery (of part) of the Croatian rural area with more optimism...|$|E
40|$|A {{modelling}} system (MS) {{for evaluation of}} current increment (net and gross growth) and mortality in Russian forests is presented. The informational basis of the MS are the data of the Russian forest state account (growing stock by dominant species, age, site indices, stocking) and some additional indicators (<b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> structure, average species composition, <b>type</b> and intensity <b>of</b> disturbance regimes by ecoregions and/or landscapes. The MS includes model blocks generated with available information including yield tables (general, regional, full-stocked, with different stocking and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> structure), growth tables, models, and experimental data for managed and unmanaged, disturbed and undisturbed forests. Two-dimensional (by age and site index) and three-dimensional (age, site index and stocking) models by species and ecoregions, based on regularities of coefficients of Mitscherlich growing functions, were used as the nuclei of the MS. The preliminary results, received for several Russian forest forming species gave a good fit to experimental data...|$|R

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> populations is commonly measured {{with either the}} aging population ratio or the aging population density.

This study uses both indices simultaneously to identify <b>types</b> and locations <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> communities more accurately. We investigate the {{spatial distribution}} of these communities using a standard correlation analysis and bivariate local spatial statistic analysis. Empirical analysis of geospatial data of the Aichi Prefecture in Japan suggests that using both indices allows us to capture different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> communities in diverse contexts (e. g. depopulated rural areas, pockets <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> communities in urban areas, and growing concentrations <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> population in the suburbs).

40|$|Living {{organisms are}} subject to ageing. This natural process has gained greater {{importance}} in socially and medically affluent societies. For many, ageing connotes unattractive changes in {{the appearance of the}} skin. The gross morphological changes <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> skin are mirrored by a range of more profound age-associated physiological declines. Thus, skin ageing can be put into other perspectives which lie at the interfaces of molecular biology, cellular biology, oncology and cosmetic dermatology. Genetically programmed replicative senescence and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) are two processes that are fundamental to skin ageing. Some iteroparous species can be used as animal models for human ageing. Undoubtedly, scientific understanding <b>of</b> skin <b>ageing</b> is firmly rooted in the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ageing.</b> However, seven major <b>types</b> <b>of</b> skin <b>ageing</b> can be distinguished: genetic, chronological, solar, behavioural, endocrinological, catabolic and gravitational types.

There is little information on the biochemistry of tropical forest tree seeds related to their storability. It was investigated {{the influence of the}} composition of lipids and soluble sugars of two storage compartments, the cotyledons and the embryonic axis, of Melanoxylon brauna Schot. (Leguminosae- Caesalpinioideae), a hardwood known as black brauna, seeds stored at 20 ºC for 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (natural ageing) and for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours at 40 ºC (accelerated <b>ageing).</b> The levels <b>of</b> fatty acids and monosaccharides varied differentially in each of the embryo storage compartments.
