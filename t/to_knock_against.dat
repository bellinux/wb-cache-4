6000|$|The prince {{wasted no}} time. He set his horse {{at the wall}} and leaped over it. Then he looked about for the three bulrushes, pulled them up and set off with them on his way home. As he rode along one of the bulrushes {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> something. It split open and, only think! out sprang a lovely girl, who said: 'My heart's love, you are mine and I am yours; do give me a glass of water.' ...|$|E
60|$|The shadows deepened. The top of {{the great}} {{building}} swayed gently, causing the pendulum of the grandfather-clock <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> the sides of its wooden case. Jill started. The noise, coming after the dead silence, frightened her till she realized what it was. She had a nervous feeling of not being alone. It {{was as if the}} shadows held goblins that peered out at the intruder. She darted to the mantelpiece and replaced the photograph. She felt like some heroine of a fairy-story meddling with the contents of the giant's castle. Soon there would come the sound of a great footstep thud--thud....|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{had better}} leave your pistols here, Master Steve, {{and take your}} cutlass. A pistol-shot now would bring the whole village down on us, {{and we should have}} no chance of getting through the swamp with a hundred of those fellows after us. You had better draw your sword, and leave the {{scabbard}} and belt here. In the first place, it is handier to have the sword ready; and it is not so likely <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> anything when you have got it in your hand as it would be trailing behind you as you crawl along. I shall be on the look-out, sir, and shall be by your side in a brace of shakes if you hail.” ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{took another}} turn across the room, full {{of love for}} my pretty wife, and distracted by self-accusatory inclinations <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> my head <b>against</b> the door. I sat down again, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> {{your head}} <b>against</b> the wall,' {{returned}} John Harmon, suiting his action to his words, with the heartiest good will; 'and I'd give a thousand pounds for leave <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> your brains out. Listen, you scoundrel, {{and look at}} that Dutch bottle.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Sylvester uses a grabber to grab Tweety. Tweety avoids {{it until}} Spike climbs up a ladder {{and uses the}} grabber <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> Sylvester {{repeatedly}} <b>against</b> the wall, while Tweety scolds Sylvester saying, [...] "Bad Old Puddy Tat!".|$|R
6000|$|At length, none {{hindering}} them, {{they reached}} the yard where the escort and the horses waited. Here, standing under an archway, were Castell and Peter. Castell greeted Margaret in English and kissed her through her veil, while Peter, who had not seen her close since months before he rode away to Dedham, stared at her with all his eyes, and began to draw near to her, designing to find out, as {{he was sure he}} could do if once he touched her, whether indeed this were Margaret, or only Betty after all. Guessing what was in his mind, and that he might reveal everything, Inez, who held a long pin in her hand with which she was fastening her veil that had come loose, pretended <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> him, and ran the point deep into his arm, muttering, [...] "Fool!" [...] as she did so. He sprang back with an oath, the guard smiled, and she began to pray his pardon.|$|E
6000|$|On {{their way}} over the bridge Geoffrey told Walter {{that he thought he}} had better tell the whole story exactly as it had occurred, concealing only {{the fact that he had}} {{recognized}} the knight's face. [...] "You had best too," [...] he said, [...] "mention nought about the white cloak. If we can catch the man of the hut in the swamp, likely enough the rack will wring from him the name of his employer, and in that case, if you are brought up as a witness against him you will of course say that you recognize his face; but 'tis better that the accusation should not come from you. No great weight would be given to the word of a 'prentice boy as against that of a noble. It is as bad for earthen pots <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> brass ones, as it is for a yeoman in a leathern jerkin to stand up against a knight in full armour.|$|E
50|$|The pagoda {{was first}} {{established}} in the Tang dynasty {{at the same time}} as the Pujiu temple, which no longer exists. The present-day pagoda dates from 1563 during the Ming dynasty. According to local legend, the designer of the pagoda hid two golden frogs somewhere inside the pagoda. It is popular for visitors to use rocks <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> the walls in search of hollows where the frogs may be hidden.|$|E
5000|$|McElderry's debut single, [...] "The Climb", was {{available}} to download at midnight on 14 December 2009 and was released physically on 16 December 2009. According to industry sources, approximately 100,000 copies of the single were sold {{on the day of}} its release but it was not enough <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> Rage <b>Against</b> The Machine off the spot in the UK in its opening week [...] On 18 December 2009, it was announced that McElderry secured the top spot in the Irish Singles Chart for 11-17 December 2009.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen, {{you have}} the drop on me this time. I seem <b>to</b> have <b>knocked</b> up <b>against</b> {{something}} hard.

60|$|At first, however, its size--or, rather, {{its lack}} of size--was one of its chief charms in Ethelbertha's eyes. The fact that if you {{got out of bed}} {{carelessly}} you were certain <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> your head <b>against</b> the ceiling, and that it was utterly impossible for any man to put on his trousers except in the saloon, she regarded as a capital joke.|$|R
50|$|Even if the mainsprings {{were not}} prone to breakage, too much force during winding caused another problem in early watches, called 'knocking' or 'banking'. If very little slack {{was left in}} the spring after winding ('overwinding"), the {{pressure}} of the last turn of the winding knob put the end of the spring under excessive tension, which was locked in by the last click of the ratchet. So the watch ran with excessive drive force for several hours, until the extra tension in the end of the spring was relieved. This made the balance wheel rotate too far in each direction, causing the impulse pin on the wheel <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>against</b> the back of the fork horns. This caused the watch to gain time, and could break the impulse pin. In older watches this was prevented with 'stopwork'. In modern watches this is prevented by designing the 'click' with some 'recoil' (backlash), to allow the arbor to rotate backward after winding by about two ratchet teeth, enough to remove excess tension.|$|E
5000|$|Body {{checking}} : A player {{drives the}} shoulder, upper arm and hip and elbow, equally into the opponent {{to separate them}} from the puck, using the body <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> an opponent <b>against</b> the boards or to the ice. This {{is often referred to}} as simply checking or hitting and is only permitted against an opponent with possession of the puck. Body checking can be penalized when performed recklessly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, lad, but I don't {{think they}} will try <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> their heads <b>against</b> your wall. They are more like to sweep down on a sudden, and your {{watchman}} will need keen eyes to make them out before they are thundering at the gate, or climbing up the wall. However, your father knows his danger, and it is of no use talking more of it. What is done is done." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} came into a maze of dust, where a {{quantity}} of people were tumbling over one another, and where {{there was such a}} confusion of unaccountable shapes of beams, bulkheads, brick walls, ropes, and rollers, and such a mixing of gaslight and daylight, that they seemed to have got {{on the wrong side of}} the pattern of the universe. Little Dorrit, left <b>to</b> herself, and <b>knocked</b> <b>against</b> by somebody every moment, was quite bewildered, when she heard her sister's voice.|$|R
6000|$|We were strolling along Piccadilly towards Charles's club one afternoon--he is a {{prominent}} {{member of the}} Croesus, in Pall Mall--when, near Burlington House, whom should we happen <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> up <b>against</b> but Sir Adolphus Cordery, the famous mineralogist, and leading spirit of the Royal Society! He nodded to us pleasantly. [...] "Halloa, Vandrift," [...] he cried, in his peculiarly loud and piercing voice; [...] "you're the very man I wanted to meet to-day. Good morning, Wentworth. Well, how about diamonds now, Sir Gorgius? You'll have to sing small. It's all up with you Midases. Heard about this marvellous new discovery of Schleiermacher's? It's calculated to make you diamond kings squirm like an eel in a frying-pan." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{the first}} stroke of twelve a great noise arose over the silent heath, {{and the earth}} seemed to rock under {{the feet of the}} two watchers. The next moment {{by the light of the}} moon they beheld the huge stones near them leave their places and go down the slope leading <b>to</b> the river, <b>knocking</b> <b>against</b> each other in their haste. Passing the spot where stood Bernez and the beggar, they were lost in the darkness. It seemed as if a {{procession}} of giants had gone by.|$|R
60|$|Charles {{raised his}} eyebrows, and {{accepted}} it, as I thought, just a trifle grumpily. So, {{to remove the}} false impression his surliness might produce on so benevolent a mind, I entered into conversation with the polite stranger. He {{was a man of}} middle age, and medium height, with a cultivated air, and a pair of gold pince-nez; his eyes were sharp; his voice was refined; he dropped into talk before long about distinguished people just then in Brighton. It was clear at once that he was hand in glove with many of the very best kind. We compared notes as to Nice, Rome, Florence, Cairo. Our new acquaintance had scores of friends in common with us, it seemed; indeed, our circles so largely coincided, that I wondered we had never happened till then <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> up <b>against</b> one another.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{soon as he}} was off-horse Fulke went to {{the chapel}} with Gilbert to give thanks for his safe coming, and when he had eaten--he was a fat man, and rolled his eyes greedily at our good roast Sussex wheatears--we led him to the little upper chamber, whither Gilbert had already gone with the Manor-roll. I {{remember}} when Fulke heard the tide blow and whistle in the shaft he leaped back, and his long down-turned stirrup-shoes caught in the rushes and he stumbled, so that Jehan behind him found it easy <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> his head <b>against</b> the wall.' ...|$|R
25|$|Robertson told ministers (30 May) that “Haig {{had no idea}} of {{any attempt}} to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> his head <b>against</b> a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|R
50|$|Once there, Tito is refused {{entry into}} the race, but a chance meeting with Guy Gagné gives Turbo {{a chance to show}} off his speed, astounding the {{audience}} and the racers and qualifies for the race. This impossible feat soon becomes a sensation on social media and the CEO gives in to the pressure, egged on by Gagné himself, to let the snail compete. However, the night before the race, Turbo is demoralized by Gagné, while Chet confesses that he cannot bear to see his brother endanger himself. Undeterred, Turbo enters the race the next day, but the dangerous racetrack and the more experienced competitors leave him trailing in last place. At a pitstop, Whiplash and his crew give Turbo a vital pep talk, advising him to stop racing like a car. Back in the race, Turbo realizes what they mean and uses his small size to his advantage. With the snail rapidly gaining in the standings, Gagné starts racing dirty and manages <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> Turbo <b>against</b> the circuit wall, damaging his shell and weakening his speed powers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Curly or not, my head {{knows better}} than <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> itself <b>against</b> Paris walls. They are thick, and high, and the windows of every house on the wall are piled with stones, to drop upon us. And I know not well why, but things go ill with us. I never saw Her," [...] and he nodded towards the open gateway, [...] "so out of comfort. When there is {{fighting}} toward, she is like herself, and {{she is the first}} to rise and the last to lie down. But, in all our waiting here, she has passed many an hour praying in the chapel, where the dead kings lie, yet her face is not glad when she comes forth. It was wont to shine strangely, when she had been praying, at the chapel in Couldray, while we were at Chinon. But now it is otherwise. Moreover, we saw Paris very close to-day, and there were over many red crosses of St. George upon the walls. And to-morrow is the Feast of the Blessed Virgin, no day for bloodshed." ...|$|R
50|$|On a {{hot summer}} day, Woody hears a radio {{commercial}} for the latest thirst quencher, a 25-cent ice cream soda called the Drooler's Delight. Finding that he has exactly one quarter on him, {{he heads for the}} malt shop but draws the attention of the greedy Buzz Buzzard. The two adversaries play a variety of sneaky tricks on each other to steal the quarter back and forth; the contest ends when Woody, disguised as a woman, leads Buzz on a chase that causes him <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> himself out <b>against</b> a wall. When Woody reaches the malt shop and orders his Drooler's Delight, he is surprised to find Buzz as the soda jerk, who stuffs Woody into a glass and mixes him up with the ingredients. However, Woody drinks the whole thing down from inside the glass and gets the last laugh on Buzz.|$|R
50|$|The 1993 Supercoppa Italiana final was {{the closest}} Francescoli ever came to winning a trophy during his time in Italy, as Torino {{ultimately}} lost the title to Milan. With Francescoli, Torino came close to defending the title the following season, but the club was defeated by Ancona in a semi-final upset. The club's Serie A campaign, however, was more heavily contested. After initially fighting against relegation, Torino climbed the table to clinch {{a spot in the}} next season's UEFA Cup, earning four points more than the required amount to qualify for the tournament. In the European Cup Winners' Cup, for which they had qualified the previous season as the 1993 Italian Cup champions, Torino reached the quarter-finals, only <b>to</b> be <b>knocked</b> out <b>against</b> eventual champions, Arsenal. Despite a successful season for the team, Francescoli did not perform as well as in previous seasons, from an individual standpoint, as he only scored three goals in 24 appearances, his lowest tally during his four seasons in the Italian league.|$|R

'Simmun and gentlemen, I'm {{locked up}} in the front attic, through the little door on the right hand when you think you've got to {{the very top of the}} stairs--and up the flight of corner steps, being careful not <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> your heads <b>against</b> the rafters, and not to tread on one side in case you should fall into the two-pair bedroom through the lath and plasture, which do not bear, but the contrairy.
