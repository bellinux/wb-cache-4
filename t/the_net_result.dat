5|$|Once {{the first}} series had aired {{and it was}} {{realised}} that the overall approach was working well, the creative team built on and significantly expanded {{the scope of the}} comedy elements for the second. This trend continued through each subsequent series. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> was a show that immediately appealed to young children while also gaining the increasing respect—and viewership—of older audiences.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> {{was that}} little {{work was done}} on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 an {{attorney}} for Caspersen’s estate stated Caspersen’s tax returns for 2005-2008 had been audited, in an investigation that did not conclude until 2013. The attorney, Denis Conlon, stated that <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> of the four-year audit was a $7,000 refund from the government for overpayment in one year, $14,000 of additional tax due for another year (in which Caspersen had over $2.7 million of income), no refunds or additional taxes dues for the other two years, and no fines or penalties imposed for alleged offshore accounts or other conduct.|$|E

50|$|A.S. Roma {{dropped off}} {{the pace of the}} top teams during the 1986-87 season, which ended Sven-Göran Eriksson's first Italian {{employment}} prematurely. From being the top scoring team in the season before, Roma struggled with finding the back of <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> <b>resulting</b> in worsened results.|$|R
2500|$|... 'Six Hole (slang)': The [...] "six hole" [...] is {{also used}} as a slang term used when a save is made, but the puck goes into <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> <b>resulting</b> in a goal. The term is used when the goalie is unsure how the puck made it past him or her.|$|R
5|$|The {{principal}} nuclear reactions which generate nucleogenic neon isotopes {{start from}} 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne, respectively, after neutron capture and immediate emission of an alpha particle. The neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles, in turn derived from uranium-series decay chains. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> yields a trend towards lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites. 21Ne {{may also be}} produced in a nucleogenic reaction, when 20Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, at {{the same}} time all single-digit highway numbers were renumbered in the state, the M-86 {{designation}} replaced M-7. This incarnation of M-86 followed its present-day routing. Near Nottawa, M-86 ran concurrently with the contemporary M-78 north and east to Colon. In late 1948 or early 1949, the last section of highway was paved in Branch County, hard-surfacing all of M-86 for the first time. A change related to M-66 and M-78 altered M-86 in 1965. South of Battle Creek, M-66 replaced M-78. Rather than follow M-78 between Colon and Athens, M-66 used a different series of roads. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> was that along M-86, the M-78 concurrency was replaced by a shorter M-66 concurrency. The routing has remain unchanged since.|$|E
30|$|Such {{areas of}} inefficient Lg wave {{propagation}} in Japan might relate to low-Q anomalies in the crust beneath active volcanoes (shown as triangles in Figure  7), irregular topography {{at the surface}} and the Moho, and thick sediment cover. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> of their effects are to disrupt coherent Lg reflection patterns in the crustal waveguide.|$|R
30|$|Notice {{that the}} great {{advantage}} of FD relaying {{is that it is}} possible to achieve the same maximum spectral efficiency as DT, which is twice the maximum spectral efficiency achieved by HD. However, as the FD relay suffers from self-interference, it is not clear if <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> are positive or not. In the next section, we numerically investigate this issue.|$|R
5|$|Statement of {{financial}} activities or statement of support, revenue and expenses. This statement resembles {{the income statement}} of a business, but may use terms like excess or deficit rather than profit or loss. It shows <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>results,</b> by each fund, of the organization's activities during the fiscal year reported. The excess or deficit is shown as a change in fund balances, simpler to an increase or decrease in owner's equity.|$|R
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Green Atlas Shipping and its insurer, Britannia Steam Ship Insurance Association, {{sued the}} United States for US$96million, {{claiming}} negligence {{on the part}} of the Coast Guard due to faulty nautical charts. They also alleged failure {{on the part of}} the local bar pilots to advise the ship's crew not to anchor in the area, and that dredging by the United States Army Corps of Engineers had exacerbated the problems with the anchor. The U.S. countersued for US$7million in damages. In 2004, the two sides reached an agreement in which Green Atlas would pay the U.S. US$10.5million to assist with cleanup costs, and the U.S. paid Green Atlas US$4million in settlement of the faulty charts claim. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> of the settlement was payment of US$6.5million to the U.S. Although this was far less than the damages claimed by the U.S. for environmental cleanup and restoration costs, government officials still saw the settlement as a victory since the shipping company was forced to pay for part of the damage. Some Coos County officials were dissatisfied with the settlement, however, stating that it should have instead been paid to local business owners who were negatively impacted by the closure of the beach.|$|E

5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} {{re-recording}} {{has been used}} {{throughout the history of}} recording studios. Pierre Schaeffer in the 1930s and 1940s used recorded sounds, such as trains, and played them back with ambient alteration, re-recording <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result.</b> Karlheinz Stockhausen and Edgard Varèse later used similar techniques. Les Paul and Mary Ford recorded layered vocal harmonies and guitar parts, modifying prior tracks with effects such as ambient reverb while recording <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> together on a new track. Les Paul placed a loudspeaker at one end of a tunnel and a microphone at the other end. The loudspeaker played back previously recorded material - the microphone recorded the resulting altered sound.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of how existing pole-placement algorithms work {{in the case of}} a saturating input is addressed. The stability of such algorithms and the modifications needed to make them work in the presence of saturation are examined. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> of this examination are: a mathematical condition for closed-loop stability; physical intuition behind this condition; some explanation of why adaptive control has been successfully implemented, even while ignoring saturation; and some design rules for doing adaptive control on linear plants with saturating actuators...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} set of O(α) QED corrections with soft photon exponentiation to the process ep → eX in mixed variables (y=y_h,Q^ 2 =Q_l^ 2) is calculated in the quark parton model. Compared to earlier attempts, we additionally determine the lepton-quark interference and the quarkonic corrections. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> are compared to the approximation with only leptonic corrections, which amount to several percent (at large x or y: several dozens of percents). We find that the newly calculated corrections modify this by few percent or less and become negligible at small y...|$|R
40|$|In the rst part of <b>the</b> paper, place-transition <b>nets</b> and {{algebraic}} highlevel nets are {{translated into}} algebra transformation systems, thus de ning <b>the</b> <b>net</b> semantics.

5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> of <b>the</b> gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|R
30|$|With the Swarm {{satellite}} mission, reliable global {{images of}} 3 -D mantle heterogeneities, especially in regions with poor ground-based coverage, come into reach. The forthcoming mission has prompted {{the initiation of}} efforts to develop methodologies for recovering 3 -D electrical conductivity variations from space. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> of these coordinated studies supported by ESA are summarized in the report by Kuvshinov et al. (2010). One of the initial ideas was to use the C -response formalism to interpret satellite data (Kuvshinov et al., 2006), but benchmarking studies showed that the 3 -D inversion of satellite C-responses does not yield satisfactory results (Kuvshinov et al., 2010).|$|R
