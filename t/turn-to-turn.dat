40|$|This paper {{presents}} analytical {{models of}} a permanent magnet synchronous machine with a <b>turn-to-turn</b> fault, both in the stationary and in the synchronously-rotating reference frame. The models are used to investigate how a <b>turn-to-turn</b> fault impacts the harmonic content of the machine. These models can thus be a powerful tool {{in order to identify}} a specific behavior caused by the fault, which can be further utilized for fault detection and/or condition monitoring applications. It is shown that, due to the fault condition, the amplitude of the harmonics in the back-EMF changes compared with the pre-fault conditions; the amplitude change is dependent on the number or short-circuited turns in the winding. If a reduced number of short-circuited turns are considered (as typically the case {{at the beginning of the}} fault and as considered in this paper), the harmonic amplitude change is comparatively small and therefore difficult to detect. It is shown that a more powerful indication of the <b>turn-to-turn</b> fault is to monitor the current harmonic content in the rotating reference frame, where new harmonics are introduced due to the unbalance caused by the <b>turn-to-turn</b> fault...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} to study ramping <b>turn-to-turn</b> loss and {{magnetization}} loss of a no-insulation (NI) high temperature superconductor (HTS) pancake coil wound with (RE) Ba 2 Cu 3 Ox (REBCO) conductors. For insulated (INS) HTS coils, a magnetization loss occurs on superconducting layers during a ramping operation. For the NI HTS coil, additional loss is generated by the ‘bypassing’ current on the <b>turn-to-turn</b> metallic contacts, which is called “turn-to-turn loss” in this study. Therefore, the NI coil’s ramping loss is much {{different from that of}} the INS coil, but few studies have been reported on this aspect. To analyze the ramping losses of NI coils, a numerical method is developed by coupling an equivalent circuit network model and a H-formulation finite element method (FEM) model. The former model is to calculate NI coil’s current distribution and <b>turn-to-turn</b> loss, the latter model is to calculate the magnetization loss. A test NI pancake coil is wound with REBCO tapes and the reliability of this model is validated by experiments. Then the characteristics of the NI coil’s ramping losses are studied using this coupling model. Results show that the <b>turn-to-turn</b> loss is much higher than the magnetization loss. The NI coil’s total ramping loss is much higher than that of its insulated counterpart, which has to be considered carefully in the design and operation of NI applications. This paper also discusses the possibility to reduce NI coil’s ramping loss by decreasing the ramping rate of power supply or increasing the coil’s <b>turn-to-turn</b> resistivity...|$|E

40|$|A power {{transformer}} {{is one of}} the most important and expensive components in any power system. Power transformers can be exposed to a wide variety of abnormal conditions and faults. Internal <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults are the most difficult types of faults to detect within the {{power transformer}}. The IEEE Standards documents have revealed that there is no one standard way to protect all power transformers against minor internal faults such as <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults and at the same time to satisfy basic protection requirements: sensitivity, selectivity, and speed. This thesis presents a new, simple and efficient protection technique which is based on negative sequence currents. Using this protection technique, it is possible to detect minor internal <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults in power transformers. Also, it can differentiate between internal and external faults. The discrimination is achieved by comparing the phase shift between two phasors of total negative sequence current. The new protection technique is being studied via an extensive simulation study using PSCAD®/EMTDC™ 1 software in a three-phase power system and is also being compared with a traditional differential algorithm. Relay performance under different numbers of shorted turns of the power transformer, different connections of the transformer, different values of the fault resistances, and different values of the system parameters was investigated. The results indicate that the new technique can provide a fast and sensitive approach for identifying minor internal <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults in power transformers...|$|E

When <b>turn-to-turn</b> short circuit fault happens to rotor winding of the generator, the generator terminal parameters will change.

40|$|During {{the course}} of a transformer's {{operational}} life, it experiences many challenges to its insulation. Chemical stresses, such as moisture in insulating oil, deteriorate insulation chemically. Mechanical stresses and thermal stresses, such as those experienced during a large external fault, also contribute to weakening a transformer's insulation. Once these stresses have weakened the insulation to the point of breakdown, a fault may occur between windings of the transformer. These faults, known as <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults, are difficult to detect electrically at the terminals of the transformer until they have grown to the point of damaging the transformer beyond repair. Current differential transformer protection is a simple, reliable, and cost effect method of detecting <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults. This method of protection is only able to detect faults involving 10 % of the windings or more. The sensitivity of current differential protection is limited as not to cause false tripping due to normal imbalances in current. Such imbalances in current may occur when a tapchanger is used to increase or decrease the voltage {{on one side of the}} transformer. Digital current differential relays, which monitor tap changer position, compensate for current imbalances due to tapchanger operation. Other causes of current imbalance include current transformer saturation, magnetizing inrush current, and over-excitation. A transformer is designed to operate continuously at 10 % above its rated voltage. In this overexcited state, a current imbalance appears which causes a differential current to be sensed by the current differential relay. This limits the current differential relay's sensitivity as it must be designed to ignore current imbalances due to the aforementioned causes. The current differential transformer protection algorithm, which only makes use of the current magnitude, is based on the principles of an electromechanical relay. Digital relays are capable of computing the negative sequence current on both primary and secondary sides of the transformer along with the phase difference between these two negative sequence currents. By using both phase and magnitude information, negative sequence current could be used to detect <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults involving 3 % of the transformer's windings or more. <b>Turn-to-turn</b> faults may still occur even if no current is flowing on one side of the transformer, such as during energization. With no current flowing in the secondary windings of the transformer, negative sequence current based algorithms become insensitive. A transformer is particularly likely to experience a <b>turn-to-turn</b> fault during this time due to the stresses of energization. This thesis introduces a relay prototype, using both negative sequence current and negative sequence voltage, which retains its sensitivity during energization. This prototype was constructed using a micro-controller and an analog-to-digital conversion board. The transformer protection relay algorithm, including all hardware interface code and signal processing code, was then designed to suit the prototype's hardware. A 3 -phase transformer real-time simulation model, capable of simulating <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults as well as the magnetic properties of the transformer's core, was developed. The voltage and current waveforms generated by the transformer model, running in the real-time simulator, were used to test the relay prototype. The sensitivity and speed of the relay algorithm proposed in this thesis was then tested, for faults involving 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 25 % of the windings along with two commonly encountered transformer winding configurations. The relay's performance for several commonly encountered system scenarios such as over-excitation, current transformer saturation, non-zero fault resistance, transformer energization, and external faults were also examined for several <b>turn-to-turn</b> fault severities. A fault resistance of one Ohm is typical for transformer <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults. These test results were compared to current differential protection with second harmonic restraint. The experimental results presented in this work indicate that the algorithm proposed in this thesis is faster and more sensitive than restrained current differential protection and capable of detecting <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults occurring during transformer energization...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a maximum space charge limit in the IPNS-II {{synchrotron}} it is desirable to inject a Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij (KV) distribution (1). We rederive the KV distribution, first starting from a smoothed Hamiltonian and then for the full alternating gradient case. The microcanonical distribution can be generalized slightly so as to allow one to alter the aspect ratio of the beam ellipse. The KV distribution requires that the injected particles {{all have the same}} total transverse oscillation energy, and also that they are distributed uniformly throughout the entire energy shell. This requires painting the injected beam uniformly in the three independent dimensions of the energy shell. We have devised two scenarios for doing this, one involving a suitable variation of the x and y injected amplitudes during the injection process, and the second involving introducing a small coupling between the x and y motions. We have written a program to simulate the injection process which includes the <b>turn-to-turn</b> forces between the (500) injected turns. If we omit the <b>turn-to-turn</b> forces then the resulting space charge density distributions are indeed very nearly uniform within a circular beam cross section for either KV injection scenario, but are neither uniform nor circular for other plausible scenarios. With <b>turn-to-turn</b> forces included, the interturn scattering can be fairly important and the resulting density distributions tend to develop lower density halos. If we add a gradient bump to simulate magnetic quadrupole errors in the lattice, then the effects of half-integral resonances can be clearly seen.

40|$|The voltage {{transients}} generated {{during the}} breaker operations in cable systems, for instance, a wind park collection grid, can reach very low rise times. The rise times of these transients can be almost 50 times {{shorter than the}} rise time of a lightning pulse. Such transients can generate a very high voltage stress on the internal transformers insulation. In this paper, a test case is studied using verified models {{of different types of}} transformers and wind turbine layouts in order to account for typical wind turbine layouts found in modern wind farms. A critical switching scenario is chosen in order to provoke the highest possible voltage transients during a current interruption. Furthermore, internal overvoltages are estimated using model of a similarly sized winding. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage transients is higher than the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Moreover, it is found that the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter than the rise time of the lightning pulse. The shortest rise time of 40 ns is obtained in a wind turbine layout where the wind turbine breaker is placed near the transformer. Due to very short rise times of the transients, very high internal overvoltages are estimated in dry-type transformer windings. These internal overvoltages are much higher than overvoltages recorded at the basic lightning impulse level.

In the past few years, {{there has been an}} increasing concern about the occurrence of <b>turn-to-turn</b> faults in power transformers due to the high costs that unexpected outages cause. It is not always possible to analyze the transformer behavior under such faults under rated conditions, since the tests are largely destructive. Therefore, in order to avoid severe damage to machines, models are used for the analysis. Thus, many attempts were made to develop a more accurate method to compute the fault currents, among which Finite Element Method (FEM) -based approaches are the most accurate. Unfortunately, the time taken to model and solve by such methods is more, especially when the number of elements considered are more.
