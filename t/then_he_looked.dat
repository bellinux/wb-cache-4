I don’t know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion.” When the convoy reached a train crossing, Nghĩa said that Nhung “lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Diệm, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Diệm nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.” ...|$|E

[...] According to historian Howard Jones, the fact [...] "that the killings failed to make the brothers into martyrs constituted a vivid testimonial to the depth of popular hatred they had aroused."

Diệm could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared—and he had created organizations that were the arms of his personal power." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} {{looked at}} him curiously. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> still more curiously up the passage towards the main entrance. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> back at Brown again, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> very carefully at the window beyond Brown's head, still coloured with the after-glow of the storm.

5000|$|Enslin's {{problems}} with Room 1408 begin {{before he even}} sets foot through the door; in fact, the door itself initially appears to be crooked to the left. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> again and the door appears to be straight - <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> again, and {{it appears to be}} crooked, now to the right.|$|R
50|$|Avon {{confirmed}} {{her death}} {{after returning to}} the ruined and collapsing tunnels. He was very certain when he tells Tarrant, his voice becoming softer, as it is often when talking to or about Cally, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> away in the distance.|$|R

50|$|The milonguero {{generally}} selects skillful {{partners to}} maintain his reputation.

60|$|Though fairies are the 'phantasmogenetic agencies' {{in second}} sight, a man may acquire the art by magic.
