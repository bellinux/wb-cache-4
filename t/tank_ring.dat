40|$|Measuring {{surveying}} {{control system}} for storage steel tanks farm {{has been developed}} for frequent measuring settlement and deformation of tank. The described system depends on soil investigation and design of precise surveying measurement procedure. The system included construction of permanent ground control points {{to be used for}} both vertical and horizontal measurements. These points are protected from any move; therefore they were constructed on stable soil strata at about 40 m deep and kept isolated to avoid the influence of the surrounding soil. Markings for settlements (50 x 50 x 5 x 100 angles) were fixed to the base and for deformation (2 x 2 cm surveying stickers) were fixed on every <b>tank</b> <b>ring</b> (11 horizontal shell rings) along 48 vertical sections. The system is designed to be permanent and give accuracy for settlement measurements of 0. 005 mm and for deformation 2 mm. Precise ground surveying measuring procedure was employed for settlement measurements and deformation measurements. The system was applied to petroleum tank farm at Portsaid region in Egypt. Results show deformation behavior at each ring of the tank wall which varied along the vertical section and position on ring. Two figures of deformations were measured. The first was due to the manufacture and construction quality which reached 14. 5 cm at some position as initial figure before tanks filling. The second figure of deformation measurement was that generated due to the effect of filling the tank with fuel and was expected to be influenced by the characteristic of the tank wall steel material; that figure reached 5. 3 cm at various locations. For settlement two measurements were observed. The first was to indicate the instant settlement that took place due to loading effect, and reached 2. 7 cm in some tanks. The second was for determining the rate of settlement per year after operating the site, that figure reached 3. 76 cm/year for some tanks with total settlement after 42 months of 13. 16 cm. Measurements were taken at different loading conditions and along a period of time with loading and unloading fluctuation. The designed system allows for precisely monitoring settlement and deformation over years, thus help in continuously indicate safety and reliability of the tanks and help in the repair or reconstruction decision which may be considered for continuing in service.

40|$|In a {{radio-frequency}} (RF) system-on-chip (SoC), {{a digital}} baseband/application processor, which occupies {{most of the}} silicon area, determines the SoC fabrication process technology and voltage supply. The rest of the circuitry, including RF front-end and frequency synthesizer, must then adopt the chosen process technology, i. e., presently low-voltage deep nano-scale CMOS. To design a fully integrated power/area efficient receiver in this respect, new RF/analog techniques are required {{to be able to}} function well at the reduced voltage headroom. In addition, new oscillator structures need to be developed that can work at low supply voltages and in face of poor quality current sources while providing high spectral purity. On the other hand, conventional RF/analog designs have not benefited significantly from CMOS scaling, which continually reduces transistor cost and improves digital performance. Here in this thesis, traditional continuous-time (CT) analog components, such as opamps, are avoided and, instead, most of signal processing and filtering is done using passive switched-capacitor circuits in discrete-time (DT) domain. In this way, the receiver front-end becomes process scalable similar to digital circuits enjoying performance and cost improvements with each process scaling node. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, principles, design and implementation of a fully integrated DT superheterodyne receiver frontend are described. To start with, the optimal sampling scheme in a high-intermediate frequency (IF) receiver architecture is explained. It is followed by sequentially introducing all the constituent circuits. A novel DT high-order low-pass filter is proposed to be used at the receiver baseband. This filter has an exceptionally low noise and high linearity. Deep analysis, verified by test-chip measurements, is presented. Next, a very high 156 Summary sampling rate DT bandpass filter (BPF) using I/Q charge sharing is proposed and analyzed. Then, a novel wideband noise-cancelling LNTA is proposed with a two-fold noise cancellation technique. Finally, a fully integrated DT superheterodyne receiver is proposed with explanations to its DT model, frequency translations, and image rejection mechanisms. The whole idea, design and analyses are successfully verified by a 65 -nm CMOS test chip. The implemented receiver has an exceptional high uncalibrated IIP 2 of + 90 dBm. In the second part of this dissertation, design and implementations of low-voltage fully integrated oscillators in nano-scale CMOS are discussed. First, a high-swing class-C oscillator is proposed that efficiently uses the drastically reduced supply voltage in nano-scale CMOS. Measurement results of a low-power low-voltage test chip in 90 -nm CMOS shows phase noise figure-of-merit as high as 192 dBc/Hz from a 0. 6 V power supply. The idea of the high-swing class-C oscillator is extended to an ultra-low phase noise dual-core oscillator implemented in 65 nm CMOS. This oscillator is the first-ever fully integrated design that meets phase noise requirements of a GSM basestation standard in a bulk CMOS technology. Next, another novel low-voltage oscillator topology is proposed that uses a series-LC <b>tank</b> <b>ring</b> structure. Its realization in 40 -nm CMOS targets low silicon area using low-Q inductors. It exhibits 7 – 20 dB better phase noise than other state-of-the-art low area oscillators...|$|E

40|$|On the Darling Downs in Queensland {{there is}} a {{proliferation}} of offstream water supply storages (known locally as <b>ring</b> <b>tanks),</b> used mainly for irrigation of broad-acre crops. Many <b>ring</b> <b>tanks</b> are sited close to public roads for many reasons; the sealed roads provide all-weather access to irrigation areas and particularly waterharvesting pumps but also provide a hard catchment {{in close proximity to}} the storage thus improving the frequency of harvestable overland flows. There are many <b>ring</b> <b>tanks</b> in the district located within 50 m of public roads. The question immediately arises of the potential safety hazard to road users in the event of dam failure. In this paper the NWS FLDWAV model was applied to simulate the dam break flood wave for a typical <b>ring</b> <b>tank</b> using a planar surface of varying slope and roughness. The model output was then analysed with regard to vehicle stability to determine a safe buffer distance between the <b>ring</b> <b>tank</b> and road. It was found that the flood wave would produce a subcritical flow on outlet slopes typical of the area for which vehicle stability would be controlled by buoyancy rather than inertia. The impact of the dam break wave on stability would be reduced by the hydraulic effect of the elevated roadway and through the maintenance of a smooth outlet. A minimum buffer distance of 250 m is recommended for smooth, mild outlet slopes in which the flow is impeded by an elevated roadway, increasing to up to 400 m depending on the final breach width...|$|R

RTWO has {{the characteristics of}} both conventional LC <b>tank</b> oscillator and <b>ring</b> oscillator. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} be analyzed by a general-purpose method.

The resulting optimization problem is relaxed to be a Geometric Programming (GP) and can be efficiently solved with a convex optimization solver. A novel scheme to control the rotation direction is also suggested for skew control. Experimental results show that our method can rapidly compute the globally optimal trade-off and reduce the power by up to 85 % for a 11. 8 GHz RTWO design.

40|$|Above ground steel {{storage tanks}} {{are widely used}} to store liquids {{in a variety of}} industries. The design and fitness for service {{procedures}} for such tanks are a concern for international standards and need to be continually improved upon to ensure better safety and serviceability. Several important aspects about tank design and assessment are studied in this thesis. The bottom plate material near the shell to bottom joint in the tank is generally in plastic range. It is a critical failure point in many modes of tank failure. The effect of increasing the bottom plate projection length at this joint for <b>tanks</b> with rigid <b>ring</b> wall foundations is studied both theoretically and numerically. A theoretical beam model is validated using finite element analysis (FEA) and extended to determine the length of bottom plate projection needed for maximum effect. The formation of plastic hinges in the bottom plate on the inside and outside of this joint is discussed in detail using FEA. Tanks operating at elevated temperatures (200 ﾟF to 500 ﾟF) need to consider additional stresses due to thermal expansions and restraints from the tank shell and bottom plate interactions. The frictional forces from the foundation cause significant stresses at the tank bottom. The design guidelines by API 650 standard address this issue using a factor named ‘C’ that defines the ratio of actual expansion against free expansion of the tank bottom. At present, an empirical range of ‘C’ values (0. 25 – 1. 0) is allowed without clear guidelines for selecting a suitable value. This thesis evaluates the current procedure and suggests an alternate method by incorporating the friction coefficient directly in the stress equations, instead of the C-factor. The fill/draw down cycle of the stored liquid could lead to low cycle fatigue near shell to bottom joint. The peak alternating stress (strain) at this location determines the fatigue life of the tank. The widely used API 650 procedure employs beam on elastic foundation theory to determine the fatigue life for all tanks. The thesis shows that this is incorrect for <b>tanks</b> on concrete <b>ring</b> wall. The appropriateness of using this theory is studied and an alternative beam model is proposed. It is verified using FEA. Damage due to corrosion in the form of local thin area (LTA) is a widespread problem in storage tanks. Fitness for service (FFS) methods are quantitative engineering evaluations used to demonstrate the structural integrity of an in-service tank containing damage like LTA and make run, repair or replace decisions.

This thesis uses a modified reference volume for mα-tangent method applied to tanks and reports initial results for FFS evaluations.

Current {{designs for the}} cryogenic tanks of these vehicles are dual-lobed and quad-lobed tanks which are packaged more efficiently than circular tanks, but still have low packaging efficiencies with large gaps existing between the vehicle outer mold line and the outer surfaces of the tanks. In this study, tanks that conform to the outer mold line of a non-circular vehicle were investigated. Four structural concepts for conformal cryogenic tanks and a quad-lobed tank concept were optimized for minimum weight designs. The conformal tank concepts included a sandwich tank stiffened with axial tension webs, a sandwich tank stiffened with transverse tension webs, a sandwich <b>tank</b> stiffened with <b>rings</b> and tension ties, and a sandwich tank stiffened with orthogrid stiffeners and tension ties. For each concept, geometric parameters (such as ring frame spacing, the number and spacing of tension ties or webs, and tank corner radius) and internal pressure loads were varied and the structure was optimized using a finite-element-based optimization procedure. Theoretical volumetric weights were calculated by dividing {{the weight of the}} barrel section of the tank concept and its associated frames, webs and tension ties by the volume it circumscribes. This paper describes the four conformal tank concepts and the design assumptions utilized in their optimization. The conformal tank optimization results included theoretical weights, trends and comparisons between the concepts, are also presented, along with results from th...|$|R
40|$|Atlas is a pulsed-power {{facility}} {{under development}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory to drive high-energy density experiments. Design {{has been completed}} for this new generation pulsed-power machine consisting of an azimuthal array of 24, 240 -kV Marx modules and transmission lines supplying current to the load region at the machine center. The transmission line consists of a cable header, load protection switch, and tri-plate assembly interfacing to the center transition section. The cable header interface to the Marx module provides a mechanism to remove the Marx module for maintenance without removing other components of the transmission line. The load protection switch provides a mechanism for protecting the load during charging of the Marx {{in the event of}} a pre-fire condition. The aluminum tri-plate is a low-inductance transmission line carries radial current flow from the Marx energy storage system at the machine periphery toward the load. All transmission line components are oil insulated except the solid-dielectric insulated power flow channel connected directly to the load. The transition region at the machine center consists of several components that enable the radial converging vertical transmission lines to interface to a horizontal disk/conical power flow channel delivering current to the load. The current carrying transition components include the high-voltage and ground conductors interfacing to the tri-plate transmission lines. The tri-plate <b>tank</b> attachment <b>ring</b> interfaces to the tri-plate tanks and the base-plate. The base-plate supports the transition components and interfaces to the center support structure of the machine. The bottom insulator also attaches to the base-plate and to the high-voltage conductor, providing an oil containment seal between the transition and vacuum vessel. Design has been completed for all Atlas components. Some prototype hardware fabrication has been completed and first article hardware is in various stages of completion. The first article is a single line of the machine and includes a Marx module, cable header, load protection switch, tri-plate transmission line, and a dump load for testing. Testing is in progress on some prototype and first article components to verify performance before production begins on critical system components. Production will soon begin for much of the overall system, including the Marx tanks, tri-plate tanks, support structure, some transition components, and the personnel platform. These components will be fabricated and installed while the remaining internal components are being fabricated...|$|R
40|$|During-vitrification {{operations}} in the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP), some feed components will be vented from the melter to the melter offgas cleaning equipment. The current HWVP reference process for melter off. -gas treatment includes a submerged bed scrubber (SBS) to provide {{the first stage of}} off-gas scrubbing and quenching. During most melter/off-gas test runs at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) with the Pilot Scale Ceramic Melter (PSCM) and at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP), no significant quantities of sedimentation were accumulated in the SBS scrub tank. However, during test run SF- 12, conducted at West Valley, approximately 6 in. of sedimentation accumulated in the scrub tank. This raised concerns that a similar accumulation could occur with the HWVP SBS, If such an accumulation rate occurred during a sustained melter run, the SBS would soon cease to function. To alleviate the potential for sedimentation buildup, the HWVP SBS design includes a sparge ring {{at the bottom of the}} scrub <b>tank.</b> The sparge <b>ring</b> will be operated intermittently to prevent buildup of solids which could interfere with circulation with the SBS Scrub tank. This report presents the results of testing conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the HWVP sparge ring design. Section 2 contains-the conclusions and recommendations; Section 3 summarizes the objectives; Section 4 describes the equipment and materials used; Section 5 gives the experimental approach; and Section 6 discusses the results. The appendices contain procedures for sediment resuspension testing and particle size distribution data for silica and sediment...|$|R
