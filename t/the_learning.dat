30|$|Machine {{learning}} {{can be classified}} into <b>the</b> supervised <b>learning,</b> semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised <b>learning.</b> <b>The</b> supervised <b>learning</b> deduces a functional relationship from the training data that generalizes well to the whole dataset. In contrast, <b>the</b> unsupervised <b>learning</b> has no training dataset and {{the goal is to}} discover the relationships between the samples or reveal the latent variables behind the observations [5]. <b>The</b> semi-supervised <b>learning</b> falls between <b>the</b> supervised and <b>the</b> unsupervised <b>learning</b> by utilizing both of the labeled and the unlabeled data during the training phase [24]. Among the three categories of <b>the</b> machine <b>learning,</b> <b>the</b> supervised <b>learning</b> is <b>the</b> best fit to solve the prediction problem in the auto-scaling area [5]. Therefore this paper investigates the theoretical foundation of <b>the</b> supervised <b>learning.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} dynamic information in human and pigeon object recognition. Both species were trained to discriminate between two objects that each had a characteristic motion, so that either cue {{could be used to}} perform the task successfully. The objects were either easy or difficult to decompose into parts. At test, <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> objects could appear in either their <b>learned</b> motions, <b>the</b> reverse of <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions, an entirely new motion, or, a new object could appear in one of <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions. For humans, any change in <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motion produced a decrement in performance for both decomposable and non-decomposable objects, but participants did not respond differentially to new objects that appeared in <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions. Pigeons showed the same pattern of responding as humans for decomposable objects, except that pigeons responded differentially to new object in <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions. For non-decomposable objects, pigeons used motion cues exclusively. We suggest that dynamic information may be processed differently by pigeons and humans as a function of whether objects are decomposable...|$|R

40|$|We {{focus on}} {{generative}} autoencoders, such as variational or adversarial autoencoders, which jointly learn a generative model alongside an inference model.

We call the distribution to which the inference model maps observed samples, <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> latent distribution, {{which may not be}} consistent with the prior. We formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, equivalent to iteratively decoding and encoding, which allows us to sample from <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> latent distribution.
