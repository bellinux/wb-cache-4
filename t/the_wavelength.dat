5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method to find <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of {{electromagnetic}} radiation {{for determining the}} speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5|$|The symbol λ {{is used to}} mean <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of {{the signal}} being {{transmitted}} on the line or a section of line of that electrical length.|$|E
5|$|An inelastic {{collision}} between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called Compton scattering. This collision {{results in a}} transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.|$|E

5000|$|The {{composition}} of {{a mixture of}} N attenuating species can be found by measuring the absorbance at N <b>wavelengths</b> (<b>the</b> values of the molar coefficient of attenuation for each species at these wavelengths must also be known). <b>The</b> <b>wavelengths</b> chosen are usually <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of maximum absorption (absorbance maxima) for the individual species. None of <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> must be an isosbestic point {{for a pair of}} species. The set of the following simultaneous equations can be solved to find the concentrations of each attenuating species: ...|$|R
50|$|Radiant barrier {{materials}} {{must have}} low emissivity (usually 0.1 or less) at <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> {{at which they}} are expected to function. For typical building materials, <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are in <b>the</b> mid- and long-infrared spectrum, in the range of 3-15 micrometres.|$|R
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E
5|$|Since an {{electron}} behaves as a wave, {{at a given}} velocity it has a characteristic de Broglie wavelength. This is given by λe=h/p where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum. For the 51GeV electron above, <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> is about , small enough to explore structures well below {{the size of an}} atomic nucleus.|$|E
50|$|IA-FF - Impairment Aware First Fit (IA-FF) is {{a simple}} {{extension}} of IA-BF. Instead of picking <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> {{in terms of the}} minimum cost, <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are selected in order according to their index. IA-BF tends to outperform IA-FF under most scenarios.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> reduced Compton <b>wavelength</b> is {{a natural}} {{representation}} for mass on the quantum scale. Equations that pertain to inertial mass like Klein-Gordon and Schrödinger's, use <b>the</b> reduced Compton <b>wavelength.</b> <b>The</b> non-reduced Compton <b>wavelength</b> {{is a natural}} representation for mass that has been converted into energy. Equations that pertain to the conversion of mass into energy, or to <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of photons interacting with mass, use <b>the</b> non-reduced Compton <b>wavelength.</b>|$|R
25|$|For {{sound waves}} in air, {{the speed of}} sound is 343m/s (at room {{temperature}} and atmospheric pressure). <b>The</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of sound frequencies audible to the human ear (20Hz–20kHz) are thus between approximately 17m and 17mm, respectively. Note that <b>the</b> <b>wavelengths</b> in audible sound are much longer than those in visible light.|$|R
5|$|The λ {{ring was}} one of two rings {{discovered}} by Voyager 2 in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located just inside the ε ring, between it and the shepherd moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane just inside the λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2km—and has the equivalent optical depth 0.1–0.2km at <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> 2.2μm. The normal optical depth is 0.1–0.2. The optical depth of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth is as high as 0.36km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ ring was initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by Voyager 2. The detection during a stellar occultation at <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> 2.2μm was only announced in 1996.|$|E
5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E

5|$|Callisto {{has a very}} tenuous {{atmosphere}} {{composed of}} carbon dioxide. It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> 4.2micrometers. The surface pressure {{is estimated to be}} 7.5 bar (0.75 µPa) and particle density 4cm3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4days (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E

5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. <b>The</b> <b>wavelength</b> of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water.

5|$|In a flame test, {{sodium and}} its {{compounds}} glow yellow because the excited 3s electrons of sodium emit a photon when they fall from 3p to 3s; <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of this photon corresponds to the D line at about 589.3nm. Spin-orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two, at 589.0 and 589.6nm; hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E

It is classified {{as a type of}} physical urticaria. The classification of disease types is somewhat controversial. One classification system distinguished various types of SU based on <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the radiation that causes the breakout; another classification system is based on the type of allergen that initiates a breakout.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the λ ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the Uranian ring system, outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with <b>the</b> <b>wavelength</b> dependence of the optical depth, indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust. The normal optical depth of this dust is 10−4–10−3.
