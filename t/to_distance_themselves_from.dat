In 2015, the perpetrators of the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary met at the pub to discuss the crime shortly after it occurred, but were secretly filmed there by the Flying Squad. All were subsequently arrested and sent to prison.

5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Union {{released}} its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940. This was followed by a series of films penned by Saeroen which were increasingly oriented towards the Indies' growing intelligentsia and attempted <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the theatrical conventions which were common in the contemporary film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism. Following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work {{was meant to be}} realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} gulf between the Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the Football League, many established clubs in the Premier League have managed <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing {{in large part to}} the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues, many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except 2001–02 and 2011–12, at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In 1997–98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but {{made no mention of}} Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E

5|$|In early October 1942, Jevđević and Baćović, with 3,000 Chetniks from Herzegovina and {{southeast}} Bosnia, {{participated in the}} Italian-led Operation Alfa. This involved a two-pronged thrust towards the town of Prozor. German and NDH troops drove from the north, and Italian and Chetnik forces pushed from the Neretva River. Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian–Chetnik force. Individual Chetnik bands, acting on their own, proceeded to burn a number of Muslim and Catholic villages, and killed between 543 and 2,500 non-Serbs in the Prozor area. Their behaviour angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw. Some were discharged altogether while others were sent to northern Dalmatia to aid Đujić's forces. A month after the massacre, Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailović, hoping <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> {{the actions of the}} troops.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June the Regent {{appointed}} Lord Liverpool {{to head a}} new Tory administration. Despite their eulogies {{to their}} fallen leader, {{members of the new}} government soon began <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> his ministry. Many of the changes that Perceval had opposed were gradually introduced: greater press freedom, Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. The Orders in Council were repealed on 23 June, but too late to avoid the declaration of war on Britain by the United States. Lord Liverpool's government did not maintain Perceval's resolution in acting against the illegal slave trade, which began to flourish as the authorities looked the other way. Linklater estimates that around 40,000 slaves were illegally transported from Africa to the West Indies, because of lax enforcement of the law.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusive}} use of {{the term}} Wicca—referring to the entirety of Pagan Witchcraft religion—has been traced to Britain in the early 1960s, when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts, magazines, and other literary sources. It was later adopted by figures like Alex Sanders and Gavin and Yvonne Frost, who took it to the United States. There, practitioners of British Traditional Wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other Pagan Witches. This exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a generic term by prolific authors such as Raymond Buckland, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf. As it entered popular culture, it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage. During the 1990s, some attempted <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> it by utilising the term Traditional Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle, {{reversing}} the British defeat of 6 July, inflicting severe losses on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and trapping Linois in Cadiz proved decisive in confirming British control of the Mediterranean Sea. With the French plan to reinforce the army stranded in Egypt in ruins, the British invasion fleet was free to operate without interference, succeeding in capturing the country in September 1801. In a wider sense too, it emphasized {{the degree to which}} the Royal Navy dominated European waters, destroying any attempt by the navies of France and its allies to conduct operations at sea. In Spain the government, furious at the losses suffered for so little gain, began <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the alliance with France, which was a contributing factor in the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802 that ended the French Revolutionary Wars. For the remainder of the war the British maintained undisputed control of the Mediterranean Sea and the Spanish coast, the Cadiz blockade preventing the French and Spanish forces there from putting to sea.|$|E

40|$|This article {{adds to the}} {{existing}} discussion regarding the NPM, and more specifically addresses the role of managerial identity that is often ignored within {{the existing}} literature. The research was conducted utilising a grounded, qualitative methodology. The data was analysed utilising the tools of critical discourse. Throughout the article a case will {{be made that the}} introduction of private sector ‘business paradigms’ have led the managers to seek their legitimacy and their sense of identity not from the public sector but from the private sector. In doing so they have <b>distanced</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the public, the owners of the assets they manage. The research is a qualitative study that highlights the conflict between identity and community expectation. The implications suggest that managers of local government business operations {{need to be aware of}} the possible conflict that can arise through seeking identity with the private sector in that it may lead <b>to</b> <b>distancing</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the public they serve. The practical implications lie in being able to recognise that too close an identity with “normal” business practice can conflict with provision of public service...|$|R
