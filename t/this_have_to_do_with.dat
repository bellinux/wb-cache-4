On 26 February 2010, he participated in the 2010 Viña del Mar International Song Festival as one of the top performers. His performance was followed by Colombian singer Fanny Lu. One hour after Lus performance, a 8.8 magnitude massive earthquake affected the south-central regions of Chile. On social networks, Arjona was jokingly blamed, with remarks such as [...] "earthquakes go where he goes", making reference also to the earthquake felt in Mexico after the singer arrived. After the tour, Arjona announced his twelfth studio album, Poquita Ropa, which was released on 24 August 2010. It was preceded by the genre-mixing track [...] "Puente", an ode to Havana, Cubas largest and capital city. The song failed to break in the upper tier of Billboard charts, and was reportedly prohibited in Cuba. The album became his third to debut or reach No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart. Within two weeks of release, the album received a Gold certification in Chile, United States, Colombia and Puerto Rico; and Platinum certification in Mexico and Argentina.|$|E

The cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces, while the octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges and 8 faces. Is this reversal in the number of faces in each dimension common? In the problem session you saw that v-e+f= 2 for 3 -polytopes. Is something similar true in higher dimensions? Are there other restrictions on the number of faces of each dimension? What is the most number of faces in each dimension if we fix the number of vertices and dimension? The least? What if we fix other numbers of faces in random dimensions? Notice that all of these questions involve counting faces of various dimensions. Another situation where these types of questions occur comes is hyperplane ar-rangements. A hyperplane of R d is any set of the form l − 1 v (c) = {x: v · x = c}, where v is a fixed vector in R d and c ∈ R. Consider the arrangement of 5 lines in Figure 1. How are they different? How are they the same? Is there a connection between hyperplane arrangements and polytopes? An apparently unrelated topic [...] . Let G be an undirected graph.
