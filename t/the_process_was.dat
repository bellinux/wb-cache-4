5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the system could be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E
