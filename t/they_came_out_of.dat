5|$|On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors {{surrounded}} Fort Presque Isle (on {{the site}} of Erie, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After holding out for two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, {{on the condition that}} they could return to Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most of the soldiers after <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the fort.|$|E

Angry at Nancy, Charlie changes the subject and asks the lizards why <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sea in the first place. They do not know, other than they have changed somehow and do not belong there anymore.|$|E

25|$|They did not thrive, however, and <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the valley}} in poor condition, due mainly due to {{insufficient}} {{number of men}} to water, feed and groom them and the conditions were unfavourable for exercise, which is essential for keeping horses in good health and condition. There was on average one man to look after six or seven horses, and at times in some regiments {{there was only one}} man for every 15 horses after the daily sick had been evacuated and men for outposts, patrols and anti-malarial work had been found.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, a {{cinder notch}} {{was added to}} No. 8 furnace at Lock Ridge, an {{innovation}} which allowed removal of slag from the furnace during the blast. The operators initially struggled with fine-dirt problems after the change, {{and it was only}} eliminated when the furnace burnt out part of the lining. The furnace was re-lined to the new geometry and found to be much more efficient, and No. 7 and No. 2 furnaces were remodeled in the same fashion at the end of 1881. The other furnaces of the company were remodeled as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> blast. In 1882, Thomas Iron took over the Ironton Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} the Romans have the {{advantage}} of total surprise and numbers (40 Carthaginian against 55 Roman and Massalian ships), but the combat effectiveness of the Carthaginians is not reflected in the number of ships as one-quarter of their fleet had newly trained crew. The Romans formed 2 lines with the 35 Roman ships in front and the 20 Massalian ships behind them, with the formation and the naval skill of the Massalians nullifying the superior manoeuvrability of the Carthaginian fleet. The Romans engaged the Carthaginian ships as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the river, ramming and sinking four of them and boarding and capturing two more. The Carthaginian crews then lost heart, beached their ships and sought safety among the army. The Romans grappled and hauled away 23 of the beached ships.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be sure what they have or might be buying and therefore {{what it might be}} worth.|$|E
25|$|When Francis Farquhar, {{the first}} {{commanding}} officer {{was killed in}} action at St Eloi on March 20, 1915, he was replaced by Lt Col H. Buller, another British regular who had served with him of {{the staff of the}} Governor General before the war. On May, 8 the stout defence of Bellewaerde Ridge during the Battle of Frezenberg established the reputation of the Patricias but at tremendous cost. When <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the line they had lost 500 men in three days. The tattered remains were commanded by a lieutenant, all other officers having been killed or wounded. The PPCLI served for a year with the 80th Brigade before joining the new 7th Brigade within the 3rd Canadian Division on December 22, 1915. In 1916 the regiment fought major battles at Mount Sorrel and on the Somme. It was not until October 1916 that the first Canadian, Lt Col Agar Adamson, was appointed to command the regiment. In 1917 as part of the Canadian Corps, the regiment took part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge on April 9, 1917, and Passchendaele later the same year. In 1918 the regiment fought at the Battle of Amiens, Jigsaw Wood, and the Battle of the Canal du Nord as part of the great battles of the Hundred Days that ended the war. The 4th Company, PPCLI, entered Mons with other Canadian troops early on November 11, 1918, before the armistice took effect at 11 AM.|$|E
500|$|Milk's {{role as a}} {{representative}} of San Francisco's gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President Gerald Ford, while visiting San Francisco, walked from his hotel to his car. In the crowd, Sara Jane Moore raised a gun to shoot him. A former Marine who had been walking by grabbed her arm as the gun discharged toward the pavement. The bystander was Oliver [...] "Bill" [...] Sipple, who had left Milk's ex-lover Joe Campbell years before, prompting Campbell's suicide attempt. The national spotlight was on him immediately. On psychiatric disability leave from the military, Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed. Milk, however, took advantage of the opportunity to illustrate his cause that public perception of gay people would be improved if <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the closet. He told a friend: [...] "It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that ca-ca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms." [...] Milk contacted a newspaper.|$|E

2500|$|Considering these crews had {{not been}} {{extensively}} trained in air-to-air gunnery, <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> combat looking very good. It is generally believed that the aircraft Hudson and Fraiser flew that day was an F-82G named [...] "Bucket of Bolts" [...] (46-383), as their usual aircraft was down for repairs. [...] "Bucket of Bolts" [...] would survive the Korean War and eventually be reassigned to escort duty in Alaska. It {{is believed to have}} been scrapped at Ladd AFB, Alaska in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|The {{units on}} the Milwaukee logged over 3 million miles by 1953, and were overhauled. The {{electric}} motors and prime movers {{were sent to}} Alco for rebuilding, and the shopmen at the Milwaukee Road's Menomonee Valley shops rebuilt the locomotives. <b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shops with facelifts, {{with the addition of}} EMD bulldog noses, and changed appearance, which made them look like an EMD locomotive. The units then worked on secondary lines to Canton, South Dakota Green Bay, Wisconsin and Madison-Chicago trains until retirement; #14B was finally scrapped at Jones Island in Milwaukee in May 1964. The Milwaukee employees called #14A [...] "Old Maude." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minye Kyawswa {{went on to}} lay siege to {{the city}} of Hsenwi {{throughout}} the rainy season of 1412. The Yunnan government sent an army (20,000 men and 2000 cavalry) to relieve the siege. The Ava army then ambushed the larger Chinese army as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the forest. The Chinese army was driven back. Five Chinese commanders, 2000 troops and 1000 horses were taken prisoner. Ava wanted to finish off Hsenwi and the siege went on for one more month until [...] November 1412. But Pegu came to Hsenwi's aid this time by launching a massive attack on Prome after the rainy season. The attack was serious enough that Minkhaung himself marched with his army to relieve Prome, and ordered Minye Kyawswa to join him on the southern front.|$|E

2500|$|Swindon's {{financial}} problems {{came to a}} head during the 1999–2000 season when in January 2000 Swindon—£4m in debt and losing £25,000 a week—went into administration for the first time. Chairman Rikki Hunt was forced to resign and 15 members of staff were made redundant. At one point manager Jimmy Quinn was told not to pick midfielder Robin Hulbert because one more appearance would trigger a [...] £25,000 payment to Everton under the terms of his 1996 transfer. Swindon's future was safeguarded when a consortium headed by business tycoon Terry Brady took over the club and <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> administration {{towards the end of the}} season. But it was too late to save Swindon's place in Division One— they had already been relegated in bottom place. The club's new owner sacked manager Jimmy Quinn and appointed Colin Todd— who had won promotion to the Premiership with Bolton in 1997— as manager, in hope of getting the club's fortunes back on track.|$|E
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. She took his arm. As <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E
