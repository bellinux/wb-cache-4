40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} the physical processes causing the large spread in the storm track projections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CMIP 5 climate models. In particular, the relationship between <b>the</b> climate change <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm tracks, {{as measured by the}} 2 - 6  day mean sea level pressure variance, and the equator-to-pole temperature differences at upper- and lower-tropospheric levels is investigated. In <b>the</b> southern hemisphere <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper- and lower-tropospheric temperature differences are correlated across the models and as a result they share similar associations with <b>the</b> storm track <b>responses.</b> There are large regions in which <b>the</b> storm track <b>responses</b> are correlated with <b>the</b> temperature difference <b>responses,</b> and a simple linear regression model based on the temperature differences at either level captures <b>the</b> spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean storm track <b>response</b> as well explaining between 30 and 60  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inter-model variance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm track <b>responses.</b> In <b>the</b> northern hemisphere <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two temperature differences are not significantly correlated and their associations with <b>the</b> storm track <b>responses</b> are more complicated. In summer, <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower-tropospheric temperature differences dominate <b>the</b> inter-model spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm track <b>responses.</b> In winter, <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper- and lower-temperature differences both play a role.

5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} unpublished plan envisaged basing {{himself at}} the old Discovery Expedition headquarters in McMurdo Sound. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Other journeys would follow, {{and there would be}} a continuous programme of scientific work. This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and a specially designed motor vehicle. Neither ponies nor motor traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by Frederick Jackson during the Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition of 1894–97. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from Nansen, the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10. By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic £30,000 (updated value £). However, <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis {{needed to take}} place before network synthesis was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and others and the ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (complex impedance) laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A Reactance Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a driving point impedance, that is, the impedance that is connected to the generator. The expression for this impedance determines <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary impedance expression as a network. Foster's reactance theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the reactance must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E

Rishbeth (1993) investigated <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ionosphere to solar irradiance variations during a high solar activity period using the ionosonde data over Slough, Port Stanley, and Huancayo. He found {{that the relationship between}} short-term variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> E-layer electron density and the solar irradiance is basically consistent with the relationship between their longer-term variations; for the F-layer, however, he found that short-term variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> F-layer electron density and EUV irradiance lack strong correlations.

5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
