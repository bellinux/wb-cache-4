500|$|Digital Spys Ben Rawson-Jones {{described}} the episode's stand-off between Mulder and Scully as [...] "an extremely tense moment of paranoia." [...] A New York Daily News review called the episode [...] "potent and creepy", {{and said that}} its plot [...] "was worthy of honorary passage into The Twilight Zone". Matt Haigh called it [...] "an extremely absorbing and thrilling episode" [...] on the Den of Geek website, noting its debt to The Thing, and Juliette Harrisson called [...] "Ice" [...] the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the first season. On the TV Squad blog, Anna Johns called it [...] "a spectacular episode" [...] with an [...] "excellent" [...] opening. UGO Networks called the episode's worms among the series' best [...] "Monsters-of-the-Week" [...] {{and the cause of}} [...] "much pointed-guns aggression". In Tor.com, Meghan Deans compared the scene where Mulder and Scully inspect each other for infection to a similar scene in [...] "Pilot"; in [...] "Ice", both characters were equally vulnerable and (unlike the pilot scene) Scully was not portrayed as [...] "an idiot". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode five out of five stars. They called it [...] "the most influential episode ever made", noting that the series reprised its formula several times during its run. Shearman felt that although their script was derivative, Morgan and Wong created [...] "a pivotal story" [...] by combining crucial themes from The <b>Thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] "well rounded" [...] cast of characters.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the 'Good Burger' of animation... plopping us down inside a {{fast-food}} war being fought by sponges, starfish, crabs, tiny plankton and mighty King Neptune." [...] Ed Park of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "No Pixar? No problem! An unstoppable good-mood generator, the resolutely 2-D [...] SpongeBob SquarePants Movie has more yuks than Shark Tale and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express whole." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "an animated adventure that's funnier than Shark Tale and more charming than The Polar Express." [...] Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic said, [...] "Like the TV show it's based on, it's a daffy, enjoyable creation." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the feature a score of {{three out of four}}: [...] "It's not The Incredibles, or one of those animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> child-friendly esthetic all its own." [...] Will Lawrence of Empire gave the film four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B-minus grade: [...] "The best moments in his [...] first movie outing are those that feel most TV-like, just another day in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film: [...] "You gotta love SpongeBob. Coolest sponge in the sea, although this one has a suspiciously manufactured look." ...|$|E

2500|$|The falls {{are where}} the Eaton Creek has a fifty-foot drop and are located {{north of the}} bridge {{in the part of}} the canyon {{administered}} by the US Forest Service.

2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foster the People {{was born}} out of a nascent {{relationship}} with drummer Mark Pontius, a film school student who left his group Malbec in 2009 to found a band with Foster. Pontius was impressed by the number and diversity of songs that Foster had written to that point, saying, [...] "Some were on the guitar, and some were on the computer. But it was this really awesome singer-songwriter <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tricked-out beat, and I felt we could go wherever we wanted with this." [...] The group added a bassist, Foster's long-time friend Cubbie Fink, who lost his job at a television production company during the recession. Mark Foster originally named the band Foster & the People, but people misheard it as [...] "Foster the People". Eventually, he took to the nurturing image it evoked of [...] "taking care" [...] of people, so the name stuck.|$|E

2500|$|... "playing {{with him}} was just frightening. It's a bit like an amateur guitar player from a back street who has just bought a Spanish guitar, working with Segovia. He didn't make you feel small, {{but he was just}} so perfect in what he did.... I still {{remember}} watching him singing, but he would accompany himself on the alto, and you were convinced he was playing the alto while he was singing.... the breath hadn't gone from his last word before he was playing his alto and it seemed to be simultaneous.... He got a very raw deal from history... In the Chick Webb band there were two regular singers – Ella [...] and Louis Jordan. And yet really history has consigned him to just being a comedy vocal <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bit of rock and roll, and the first alto... but he was such a consumately good singer that it's sad that he wasn't known more for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 1987 essay titled [...] "The Overhauling of Straight America", by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill), {{lays out}} a six-point {{plan for a}} campaign, which was first {{published}} in Guide magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans [...] "to think that it is just another <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shrug of their shoulders". Then [...] "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book [...] "After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the ’90s." [...] The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the gay liberation phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Time and The Washington Post. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as Focus on the Family as important {{to the success of the}} LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged [...] "homosexual agenda".|$|E
