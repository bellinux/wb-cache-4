500|$|Jennifer Berman of THEM Anime Reviews {{rated the}} anime {{adaptation}} of Twin Spica {{five out of}} five stars but told readers, [...] "Subtract a star if you don't like anime that have a somewhat slow pace." [...] Berman praised its artistic design and noted that the character designs reminded her of works by Studio Ghibli. She found the characters [...] "likeable" [...] and saw Marika Ukita as the most intriguing character. Despite her praises, Berman noted one weakness in the anime adaptation. She observed the ending as [...] "a rather open-ended one, and while it wasn't a bad ending, they probably should have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> better". Similar to the manga, the anime series was seen as gender neutral. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice president Todd Miller stated that Twin Spica {{was one of the}} titles aired on Animax which appealed to both genders. The first episode of the drama series aired with a 3.4 percent domestic viewership rating. Reviewers from the Yomiuri Shimbun rated the live-action adaptation an average two out of three stars and ranked it third overall among 11 series airing in summer 2009.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Abrams to promote 10 Cloverfield Lane, he said the creative team behind the original had some ideas on developing Cloverfield 2, but the release of movies such as Godzilla and Pacific Rim led them to abandon them as they found the concept of Kaiju movies played out. However, Abrams also suggested that he has <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> {{that if they are}} lucky enough to get it made [...] "could be really cool that [...] connects some stories" [...] in a future film, even teasing a larger Cloverfield universe. Interviews with Dan Trachtenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, director and actress of 10 Cloverfield Lane, respectively, confirm that the movie is, and always was intended to be, an expansion of the first film, with Trachtenberg calling it the [...] "Cloververse".|$|E
2500|$|After {{they were}} signed to BBC Two, {{they became the}} hosts and fashion advisors for five series of the BBC style series What Not to Wear in 2001, where they used their {{knowledge}} on fashion and harsh comments to reform the appearances and style of the participants on the show. The duo became instantly renowned for their poking and prodding of the contestants, their straight-talking advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. The editor of ELLE, Sarah Bailey, has stated [...] "You just don't expect posh girls to grab your tits, call your trousers 'too clitty' and use words like 'pussy pelmet' but they do. You are so shocked by {{what they are saying}} that by the time you have recovered and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> to say they have whipped you out of your jeans and eased you into a Lycra cat suit." [...] They have stated that their relationship is more like a marriage and that being total opposites, they balance each other out. They cannot imagine working without each other and have even considered taking insurance out on their television partnership should something unforeseen happen. Woodall and Constantine have been accused of being patronising, but reject these claims.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes again, {{they have}} had right <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> God, but not of him together; either {{thinking}} so of his justice, as to drive them from him, and also cause them to put him out of their mind (Job 21:14). Or else so thinking of his mercy as that they quite forget his holiness and justice. Now both these are but base <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> God, and so erroneous, and sinful thoughts.|$|R

2500|$|Anberlin lead vocalist Stephen Christian {{has stated}} {{different}} {{origins of the}} band's name in various interviews, prevalent among which was his claim that he had long intended to name his first daughter Anberlin. Struggling to find {{a name for the}} band, Stephen suggested it; [...] "We were all sitting around {{trying to come up with}} a name. None of us were married or had kids, but one day I was going to name my daughter Anberlin, so I figured we could name the band that until we <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> better. So we chose Anberlin and no one has thought of anything better." [...] He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, [...] "If I ever have a daughter and name her Anberlin, she'll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around." [...] Christian had also stated in another interview that the band's name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed [...] "London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin." [...] Christian thought that [...] "and Berlin" [...] would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested [...] "And Berlin," [...] which was then modified to [...] "Anberlin." ...|$|E
