5|$|He is {{also known}} for {{having one of the}} better pickoff moves <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base</b> and is {{considered}} one of the better fielding pitchers in the game.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{his speed}} {{garnered}} him comparisons to New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez. Braun has been timed at 4.2 seconds <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base</b> {{from the right}} side of the plate. In spring training in 2007, he was second-fastest in the Brewers' 60-yard dash.|$|E

5000|$|A {{player with}} two strikes against him is {{automatically}} struck out and cannot attempt <b>to</b> reach <b>first</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> (A batter may also freely advance <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base</b> if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} many {{awards in}} his first three seasons, Pujols was rewarded monetarily for his accomplishments on February 20, 2004, when he signed a seven-year, $100million contract extension with a $16million club option for 2011 with no-trade provisions. He was moved <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base</b> in 2004 after the Cardinals traded Tino Martinez in the offseason. On June 16, he hit a walk-off home run against Reds pitcher Mike Matthews in the 10th inning of a 4–3 victory.|$|E
5|$|McGinnity {{finished}} his MLB career with 246 career wins, seven 20-win seasons, and two 30-win seasons. He had nearly 500 professional wins including {{his years in}} the minor leagues. McGinnity set a career record in batters hit by pitch with 152. He revolutionized the fielding of the pitching position, by attempting to make force outs at any base, instead of only throwing the ball <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson has periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics' spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.|$|E
5|$|Playing the Yankees on June 25, 1953, he {{was part}} of a rare {{defensive}} shift; leading 4–2 in the ninth inning, he was moved <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base,</b> with Harry Dorish entering in relief. Pinch hitter Don Bollweg barely beat out a bunt single <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base,</b> but Pierce than recorded a putout on Gil McDougald's grounder to third base. He then retook the mound, and after issuing a walk, gained the final two outs to finish the victory; the White Sox set an AL record by using five first basemen in the game. Pierce was also an excellent baserunner, and was used as a pinch runner 30 times between 1949 and 1957 – even scoring as a substitute for three-time stolen base champion Minnie Miñoso in a 5–4 victory over the Yankees on June 22, 1956.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{began the}} 1991 season with Buffalo. The Pirates {{promoted}} Banister from {{the minor leagues}} on July 23, 1991, when catcher Don Slaught was injured and placed on the disabled list. Manager Jim Leyland used Banister as a pinch hitter for pitcher Doug Drabek {{in the eighth inning}} of that day's game against the Atlanta Braves at Three Rivers Stadium. Using Cecil Espy's bat, Banister hit a ball from Dan Petry and just beat shortstop Jeff Blauser's throw <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> Banister is one of only 15 batters (excluding pitchers) in baseball history to record a hit in his only major league plate appearance.|$|E

5|$|Chance {{began his}} career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger {{injuries}} suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902. In 1903, Johnny Kling became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, the Cubs' first baseman, left the team, manager Frank Selee moved Chance <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received a pay raise.|$|E
5|$|Four of the This Year in Baseball Awards {{also went}} to the Phillies. Lidge was {{recognized}} as the Closer of the Year, while Utley won the Postseason Moment of the Year award for his fake throw <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base</b> which allowed him to throw out Rays' shortstop Jason Bartlett at home plate during the World Series. Manager Charlie Manuel and general manager Pat Gillick were also named Manager of the Year (distinct from Major League Baseball's Manager of the Year award) and Executive of the Year, respectively, for their leadership of the 2008 team and for winning the World Series.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium {{was home}} to a rare {{baseball}} occurrence on August 6 and August 7, 1988, when Nashville and Indianapolis exchanged no-hitters on back-to-back nights. First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo combined for a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0Nashville win. That game was won by Nashville when Lenny Harris walked <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base,</b> stole second base, stole third base, and then came home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong pitched a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0Sounds victory.

5|$|Ishikawa {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Giants on April 24. After languishing in the minors for several months, Ishikawa again {{considered}} retirement, but the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak. In late September, {{with the return of}} Belt <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base</b> and ongoing injuries to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa to play left field {{for the first time in}} his career. Despite being a career first baseman and with just three career regular season starts in left field, Ishikawa became the Giants starting left fielder during the 2014 postseason.|$|E
5|$|Kelly, {{naturally}} a first baseman, saw regular time as {{a second}} baseman in 1925 when Frisch injured his hand, while backup Bill Terry began playing first base. With the emergence of Terry, who requested a trade {{so that he could}} receive more playing time, and Giants manager John McGraw desiring an improvement in the outfield, Kelly was traded to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1927 season for Edd Roush. The Reds traded Roush due to a contract dispute. With Wally Pipp at first base for the Reds, Kelly was slated to play center field. The Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

5|$|The lower seating bowl {{is divided}} into 24 {{sections}} and wraps around the playing field from one foul pole to the other. The second level has 16sections of seating that begin behind third base and wrap around <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> The last nine rows, from row M, on the first level between the dugouts are sheltered by the upper deck. Seats on both levels are traditional, plastic stadium-style chairs. All lower-level seats behind home plate, seats behind and between the dugouts through row P, and all second-level seats have padded seat cushions. Seats in the three center upper-deck sections behind home plate and all second-level suites also have padded seat backs. A grass berm that can accommodate 1,500spectators is located beyond the left-center field wall.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base</b> to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year he {{returned}} to the field, West worked in the ALDS. He also umpired in the 2003 and 2004 ALCS. In game six of the latter series, West's crew ruled Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez out for interference after Rodriguez appeared to swat the ball out of the glove of opposing pitcher Bronson Arroyo on his way <b>to</b> <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> Fans threw debris on the field, Red Sox manager Terry Francona pulled his team off the field, and NYPD officers in riot gear took to the field to calm the crowd. West said fans actually applauded the umpires for the correct call when they came onto the field the following day. West’s first All-Star Game and World Series appearances after his rehire came in 2005; that year he umpired in his second ALDS and his third World Series, serving as World Series crew chief.|$|E
