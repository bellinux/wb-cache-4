50|$|Choreographies of Power was {{an action}} {{commissioned}} {{as a public}} program for <b>the</b> Solomon R. <b>Guggenheim</b> Foundation’s But a Storm Is Blowing from Paradise: Contemporary Art of the Middle East and North Africa. This 30-minute procession through <b>the</b> <b>Guggenheim’s</b> collection galleries incorporated elements from <b>the</b> <b>Guggenheim’s</b> history to explore {{different aspects of the}} collection’s hidden political tools. As part of the procession, performers “enacted ceremonies, physical encounters, short speeches, and moments of violence.” These specific actions were used to shed light on the complicated dichotomies between the museum spaces and political spaces. It was researched and developed by Public Movement during a mini-residency exploring the collections and archives of <b>the</b> Solomon R. <b>Guggenheim</b> Museum, and in a studio residency at Outset Contemporary Art Fund, Tel Aviv.|$|R

5|$|Cage {{dedicated}} Sonatas and Interludes to Maro Ajemian, {{a pianist}} and friend. Ajemian performed the work many times since 1949, {{including one of}} the first performances of the complete cycle on January 12, 1949, in Carnegie Hall. On many other occasions in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cage performed it himself. Critical reaction was uneven, but mostly positive, and the success of Sonatas and Interludes led to a grant from <b>the</b> <b>Guggenheim</b> Foundation, which Cage received in 1949, allowing him to make a six-month trip to Europe. There he met Olivier Messiaen, who helped organize a performance of the work for his students in Paris on June 7, 1949; and he befriended Pierre Boulez, who became an early admirer of the work and wrote a lecture about it for the June 17, 1949 performance at the salon of Suzanne Tézenas in Paris. While still living in Paris, Cage began writing String Quartet in Four Parts, yet another work influenced by Indian philosophy.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1890s, the lead-silver {{smelting}} industry {{continued to}} struggle. There {{were too many}} smelters and too few lead-silver ore reserves nationally. Eventually, the independent minded smelting owners were forced to merge, creating in 1899 a large entity called the American Smelting & Refining Company (today known as ASARCO). At its formation, American Smelting owned 2/3 of the smelting trusts in the nation, making them a critical player in the ore and mining industry. In 1901, <b>the</b> <b>Guggenheims</b> smelting and refining assets were added to American Smelting. At that time, <b>the</b> <b>Guggenheims</b> obtained a majority of American Smelting shares and began their dominance of the company.|$|R
