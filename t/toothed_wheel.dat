5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel.</b> (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The process for coating functional surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks (3) of <b>toothed</b> <b>wheels</b> (1) using a coating source (2) rotating relative to the component and emitting a coating material in the form of electrically charged particles in the direction of the component, comprises shielding the component during the coating process in a peripheral area with a flat functional surface alignment inclined to a beam direction through an aperture (4) from coating beam arranged between the component and coating source transverse to the beam direction. The component and the coating source are rotated relative to each other around a component axis irregularly with longer dwell times in the rotating position of the functional surfaces steeply engaged to the beam direction. The component is completely coated on half-side over the limit of the peripheral area through the aperture for single-side functional surface coating of the component. The coating is carried out with ion beam or plasma beam. The coating beam is deflected and/or bundled with magnetic and/or electric field. For toothed flanks coating of the bevel wheels, the bevel wheel is rotated around a bevel axis during the coating process and the bevel axis is obliquely engaged in the direction of the coating source.

25|$|Speed sensors: A {{speed sensor}} {{is used to}} {{determine}} the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a Hall effect sensor, or a <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the sensor. The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in the sensor. Since the voltage induced in the sensor {{is a result of the}} rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his 1850 measurement, Foucault's 1862 measurement was aimed at obtaining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light, since his concern was to deduce an improved value for the astronomical unit. At the time, Foucault {{was working at the}} Paris Observatory under Urbain le Verrier. It was le Verrier's belief, based on extensive celestial mechanics calculations, that the consensus value for the speed of light was perhaps 4% too high. Technical limitations prevented Foucault from separating mirrors R and M by more than about 20meters. Despite this limited path length, Foucault was able to measure the displacement of the slit image (less than 1mm) with considerable accuracy. In addition, unlike the case with Fizeau's experiment (which required gauging the rotation rate of an adjustable-speed <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel),</b> he could spin the mirror at a constant, chronometrically determined speed. [...] Foucault's measurement confirmed le Verrier's estimate. His 1862 figure for the speed of light (298000km/s) was within 0.6% of the modern value.|$|E

6000|$|In {{this great}} Order the most {{interesting}} point for us is the difference in colour between the sexes of the same species, and between the distinct species of the same genus. Nearly {{the whole of the}} following chapter will be devoted to this subject; but I will first make a few remarks on one or two other points. Several males may often be seen pursuing and crowding round the same female. Their courtship appears to be a prolonged affair, for I have frequently watched one or more males pirouetting round a female until I became tired, without seeing the end of the courtship. Although butterflies are such weak and fragile creatures, they are pugnacious, and an Emperor butterfly[502] has been captured with the tips of its wings broken from a conflict with another male. Mr. Collingwood in speaking of the frequent battles between the butterflies of Borneo says, “They whirl round each other with the greatest rapidity, and appear to be incited by the greatest ferocity.” One case is known of a butterfly, namely the Ageronia feronia, which makes a noise like that produced by a <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> passing under a spring catch, and which could be heard at the distance of several yards. At Rio de Janeiro this sound was noticed by me, only when two were chasing each other in an irregular course, so that it is probably made during the courtship of the sexes; but I neglected to attend to this point.[503] ...|$|E
60|$|After {{eighteen}} memorable days {{spent with}} unceasing delight at Bahia, the 'Beagle' sailed again for Rio, where Darwin stopped for three months, {{to improve his}} acquaintance with the extraordinary wealth of the South American fauna and flora. Collecting insects was here his chief occupation, and {{it is interesting to}} note even at this early period how his attention was attracted by some of those strange alluring devices on the part of the males for charming their partners which afterwards formed the principal basis for his admirable theory of sexual selection, so fully developed in the 'Descent of Man.' 'Several times,' he says, 'when a pair [of butterflies], probably male and female, were chasing each other in an irregular course, they passed within a few yards of me; and I distinctly heard a clicking noise, similar to that produced by a <b>toothed</b> <b>wheel</b> passing under a spring catch.' In like manner he observed here the instincts of tropical ants, the habits of phosphorescent insects, and the horrid practice of that wasp-like creature, the sphex, which stuffs the clay cells of its larvæ full of half-dead spiders and writhing caterpillars, so stung with devilish avoidance of vital parts as to be left quite paralysed yet still alive, as future food for the developing grubs. Cases like these helped naturally to shake the young biologist's primitive faith in the cheap and crude current theories of universal beneficence, and to introduce that wholesome sceptical reaction against received dogma which is the necessary groundwork and due preparation for all great progressive philosophical thinking.|$|E
