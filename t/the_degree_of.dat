We assume L> 1 homogeneous cells with K> 0 users per cell where the users have M antennas and the base stations {{are equipped with}} N antennas. <b>The</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom outer bound for this L-cell and K-user MIMO MAC is formulated. The characterized outer bound uses insight from a limit on <b>the</b> total <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for <b>the</b> L-cell heterogeneous MIMO network. We also show through an example that a scheme selecting a transmitter and performing partial message sharing outperforms a multiple distributed transmission strategy in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom. Simple linear schemes attaining the outer bound (i. e., those achieving <b>the</b> optimal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom) are explores for a few cases. The conditions for the required spatial dimensions attaining <b>the</b> optimal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom are characterized in terms of K, L, {{and the number of}} transmit streams. <b>The</b> optimal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for <b>the</b> two-cell MIMO MAC are examined by using transmit zero forcing and null space interference alignment and subsequently, simple receive zero forcing is shown to provide <b>the</b> optimal <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for L> 1.
