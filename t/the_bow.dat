5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. <b>The</b> <b>bow</b> section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. <b>The</b> <b>bow</b> was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated in <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. <b>The</b> <b>bow</b> was badly mangled; {{in about half}} an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E

5|$|Bow Street has {{a strong}} {{connection}} with the law; <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Street Runners, an early voluntary police force, was established here by Henry Fielding in 1750, and the Metropolitan Police Service operated a station house from 1832, {{which led to the}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>Bow</b> Street Magistrates' Court.|$|E

50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, <b>the</b> Comanche <b>bow</b> {{was tested}} against <b>the</b> Mongol <b>bow</b> against seven targets. <b>The</b> Comanche <b>bow</b> delivered six hits and achieved four kills and one wound in 28s and {{was capable of}} firing three arrows at once. <b>The</b> Mongol <b>bow</b> delivered five hits and achieved four kills in 33s. Both archers had one missed shot. The edge was given to <b>the</b> Comanche <b>bow</b> for its speed and accuracy.|$|R

5|$|MV New Carissa was a {{freighter}} {{that ran}} aground {{on a beach}} near Coos Bay, Oregon, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to tow <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> section of the ship out to sea failed when the tow line broke, and <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> was grounded again. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off in situ with napalm, but a significant amount was also spilled from the wreckage, causing ecological damage to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Other less {{satisfactory}} materials than horn {{have been}} used for the belly of <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, {{have been used}} on the back of <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially {{the tips of the}} limbs were made to bend when <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part of}} the wooden core of <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b>|$|E

5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, {{was seen}} as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the {{southern}} stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and arrow depiction with that of a dog.|$|E
5|$|Later {{developments}} in the composite bow included siyahs made of separate pieces of wood, attached with a V-splice to the wooden core of <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> rather than strengthened by external reinforcement. Mediaeval and modern bows generally have integral wooden siyahs and lack stiffening laths.|$|E
50|$|String {{players can}} exert {{stronger}} pressure on <b>the</b> string when <b>bowing</b> near <b>the</b> frog than when <b>bowing</b> near <b>the</b> tip, due to <b>the</b> <b>bowing</b> hand's proximity to <b>the</b> <b>bow's</b> contact point with the string. Up-bows, which begin near the tip, are therefore {{often used to}} play the upbeats (weaker beats) within a musical phrase. Notes that begin quietly and crescendo are also ideally up-bowed — from tip to frog — allowing pressure on the string to increase naturally.|$|R
50|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{including}} much of Africa, the Americas, northern Europe, and Southern Asia, the great majority of traditional bows are self <b>bows.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>bow</b> artifacts, <b>the</b> Stellmoor and Holmegaard artifacts of Northern Europe, are self <b>bows.</b> <b>The</b> Stellmoor <b>bow</b> was made from the heartwood of a Scots pine while <b>the</b> oldest Holmegaard <b>bows</b> were carved from small-diameter elms. In primitive flight archery competitions, <b>bows</b> inspired by <b>the</b> design of <b>the</b> Holmegaard <b>bows</b> perform very well because of their light, non-bending tips.|$|R
