5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, the government of <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti.

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term residence in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic,</b> {{legal and illegal}} entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity.

5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic,</b> and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic,</b> but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do.|$|E
