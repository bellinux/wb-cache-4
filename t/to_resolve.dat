5|$|During the 1790s, {{politicians}} and land speculators in Georgia perpetrated fraudulent and corrupt land sales {{in an area}} that is now a large portion of Alabama and Mississippi. When the fraud was exposed in 1795, there was significant public outcry, and the Georgia legislation authorizing the sales was repealed. This led to a host of claims and litigation, since in a number of cases, land was afterward resold to unsuspecting third parties. President Jefferson eventually established a three-person commission <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> conflicting claims arising from the fraud. Lincoln was appointed to this commission, which developed legislation <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> the issue. Eventually approved by Congress, Georgia's claims to the area were extinguished and some land was reserved <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> other outstanding claims. The commission was also responsible for documenting and reporting on {{the nature and extent of}} the fraud, activities in which Lincoln was heavily involved.|$|E

5|$|By 2011, Serbian diplomats {{made several}} {{requests}} to the EU, asking it to pressure Croatia <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> the dispute before Croatia's accession {{to the union}} {{out of fear that}} it might follow the Slovene example and stall Serbian accession similar to the impasse between Croatia and Slovenia over their border disputes and the subsequent blockade of the Croatian EU accession negotiation process. The request was denied by the EU. Croatian President Ivo Josipović said that the dispute was the most contentious issue of Croatia–Serbia relations but added that it should not be difficult <b>to</b> <b>resolve.</b> In 2012, Josipović stated that Croatia should not block Serbia's EU accession over the issue and suggested that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, which is considered to be an acceptable solution by both countries. In 2014, the Croatian ambassador to Serbia reiterated Josipović's stance from 2012. On the other hand, Zoran Milanović, the Prime Minister of Croatia, said that the resolution of the border dispute would be Croatia's condition placed before Serbia in its EU accession negotiations.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, the {{position}} of Minister of Defence in the government in exile was heavily contested.

He began a major restructuring of the command structure of the infantry in an ultimately successful attempt <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> the situation. A minor mutiny among soldiers from an artillery battery was quickly suppressed in November 1942, but Pierlot was widely criticised by the British press during the soldiers' court martial in January 1943.|$|E
