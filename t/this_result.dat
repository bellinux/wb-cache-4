5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. <b>This</b> <b>result</b> was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{problems}} can be solved using <b>this</b> <b>result.</b> For example, consider two measuring cups of volume a and b.

5|$|Hosting the Olympic Winter Games for {{the first}} time, Japan's record {{consisted}} of a single medal: a silver in alpine skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics. In Sapporo, Yukio Kasaya, Akitsugu Konno, and Seiji Aochi won the ski jumping normal hill (70m) gold, silver, and bronze medal, respectively. Kasaya's gold was Japan's first-ever at the Winter Games. <b>This</b> <b>result</b> would persist as the country's best for the next 20 years.|$|E
