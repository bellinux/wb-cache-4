The key of a key-value pair is a unique value in the set and can be easily looked up to access the data. Key-value pairs are of varied types: some keep the data in memory and some provide the capability to persist the data to disk. The underlying data storage architecture is in general a cluster, and the execution model of data processing functions is Map-Reduce. Thus data are, in general, managed in cache using for example the memcached protocol 14 particularly popular in key-value stores. A cache provides an in-memory snapshot of the most-used data in an application. The purpose of cache is to reduce disk I/O.|$|R

Between 65, 000 and 35, 000 years ago, the planet's climate was much colder and more variable than it is now.

40|$|ABSTRACT. For herbivorous zooplankton, {{surviving}} the arctic winter requires that sufficient energy {{be stored in}} summer to enable ten months or more of possible starvation. Energy and materials for reproduction may also be totally derived from stored lipid and bodily protein. The predominant storage products are wax esters, often visible as translucent droplets or a fusiform inclusion in the tissues. Lipid may constitute more than 50 % of dry weight {{at the end of}} summer. Reproduction is synchronized with season and environmental conditions to enable offspring to exploit the brief period f intense primary production. So far as we know, fertilization occurs only once in the copepods studied here, which make up more than 98 % of the total zooplankton by numbers, and males are short lived, but in one species (Calanus hyperboreus) females may survive into a second productive season, <b>thereby</b> <b>storing</b> sufficient reserves to spawn a second time. Several planktonic species, including larval invertebrates, start growth early by utilizing algae that develop on the under-ice surface several months before the pelagic phytoplankton bloom. The minimum water temperature (- 13 °C) is constant and much warmer than the atmosphere, so overwintering should be less stressful for aquatic species than for terrestrial forms. Additional adaptations used by zooplankton in winter include seeking deeper water to escape predation, reducing swimming costs by regulating buoyancy, and further lowering metabolic rates by limiting synthesis of enzymes and increasing the fraction of lipid used in respiration...|$|E

The proposed system is related to, but not the same as, previously reported ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) systems that exploit the ocean thermal gradient but consist of stationary apparatuses that span large depth ranges. The system would include a turbine driven by working fluid subjected to a thermodynamic cycle. CO 2 has been provisionally chosen as the working fluid because it has the requisite physical properties {{for use in the}} range of temperatures expected to be encountered in operation, is not flammable, and is much less toxic than are many other commercially available refrigerant fluids.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{its primary}} {{encounter}} with a pathogen, the immune system has to decide which type of immune response is most appropriate. Based on signals from the innate immune system and the immunological {{context in which the}} pathogen is presented, responding lymphocytes will adopt a particular phenotype, e. g. secrete a particular profile of cytokines. Once stimulated, lymphocytes store the appropriate type of response by differentiating from a naive to a memory phenotype. This allows the appropriate type of immune reaction to be regenerated upon re-stimulation of those memory clones. We developed a computer simulation model in which cross-reacting effector/memory clones contribute to the immunological context of pathogens. If a pathogen is recognized by both naive clones and pre-existing effector/memory clones, the naive lymphocytes adopt the effector mechanism of the memory clone. The adaptive immune system <b>thereby</b> <b>stores</b> immunological decisions and somatically learns to induce the right type of immune response to pathogens sharing epitopes. The influence of effector/memory lymphocytes may be detrimental when they cross-react to new pathogens that require a different kind of immune response.

They determine {{whether and how}} information is perceived, how managers draw inferences from them and, <b>thereby,</b> <b>store</b> the gained knowledge in routines that can influence their future actions (Cyert and March 1963; Levitt and March 1988). Experiences must be codified before they can become knowledge (Zollo and Singh 2004); they are evaluated and woven into {{the construction of the}} organization’s reality. Inferences drawn from the experience are stored in corporate documents, standard operating procedures, rules, standards of good professional practice, and shared perceptions of “the way things are done around here” (Levitt and March 1988). Consequentially, organizational memory is retained even when important organizational members leave the organization (Weick and Gilfillan 1971; Levitt and March 1988). Interpretation of experiences—on the individual as well as the organizational level—depends on the cognitive schemes and knowledge structures of both individuals and organizations (Daft and Weick 1984; Walsh 1995). This means that information processing on both the individual and organizational level is influenced by prior experiences. Knowledge structures allocate attention (White and Carlston 1983), enable encoding (Cohen 1981), retrieval from memory (Anderson and Pichert 1978; Cantor and Mischel 1977), and help interpret experiences (Bower et al. 1979) (for details, please see Walsh 1995).

40|$|Understanding {{the drivers}} {{of climate change}} {{requires}} knowledge about the global carbon (C) cycle. Although inland waters {{play an important role}} in the C cycle by emitting and burying C, streams and lakes are in general overlooked in bottom-up approached C budgets. In this thesis I estimated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) from all lakes and streams in a 15 km 2 subarctic catchment in northern Sweden, and put it in relation to the total catchment C exchange. I show that high-latitude aquatic systems in general and streams in particular are hotspots for C emission to the atmosphere. Annually, the aquatic systems surveyed in this study emitted about 10. 8 ± 4. 9 g C m- 2 yr- 1 (ca. 98 % as CO 2) which is more than double the amount of the C laterally exported from the catchment. Although the streams only covered about 4 % of the total aquatic area they emitted ca. 95 % of the total aquatic C emission. For lake emissions, the ice break-ups were the most important annual events, counting for ca. 45 % of the emissions. Overall, streams dominated the aquatic CO 2 emission in the catchment while lakes dominated CH 4 emission, 96 % and 62 % of the totals, respectively. When summing terrestrial and aquatic C fluxes together it showed that the aquatic emissions alone account for approximately two thirds of the total annual catchment C loss. The consequence of not including inland waters in bottom-up derived C budgets is therefore a risk of overestimating the sink capacity of the subarctic landscape. However, aquatic systems can also act as C sinks, by accumulating C in sediment and <b>thereby</b> <b>storing</b> C over geological time frames. Sediment C burial rates were estimated in six lakes from a chronology based on 210 Pb dating of multiple sediment cores. The burial rate ranged between 5 - 25 g C m- 2 yr- 1, which is of the same magnitude as lake C emissions. I show that the emission:burial ratio is about ten times higher in boreal compared to in subarctic-arctic lakes. These results indicate that the balance between lakes C emission and burial is both directly and indirectly dependent on climate. This process will likely result in a future increase of C emissions from high-latitude lakes, while the C burial capacity of these same lakes sediments weaken...|$|E
40|$|A heavily used {{competitive}} tactic in {{the grocery}} business is the weekly {{advertising of price reductions}} in newspaper inserts and store fliers.

The marketing science literature has not even been able to establish that feature advertising has a substantial impact on store choice, let alone the more operational question of which categories are better at drawing consumers away from one store and into a competing store. In this paper we employ a stochastic choice modeling framework to propose and empirically estimate a disaggregate, consumer-level model of the effects of feature advertising on store choice.

The possible magnitudes of these currents are calculated by assuming that Europa is a differentiated body consisting of an outer H 2 O layer and a silicate core. Two types of models are considered here: {{one in which the}} water is completely frozen and a second in which there is an intermediate liquid layer. For the transverse electric mode (eddy currents), the calculated current density in a liquid layer is approximately 10 to the - 5 /Am. For the transverse magnetic mode (unipolar generator), the calculated current density in the liquid is severely constrained by the ice layer to a range of only 10 to the - 10 to - 11 th power/ Am, for a total H 2 O thickness of 100 km, provided that neither layer is less than 4 km thick. The current density is less for a completely frozen H 2 O layer. If transient cracks were to appear in the ice layer, thereby exposing liquid, the calculated current density could rise to a range of 10 to the - 6 to 10 to the - 5 /Am, depending on layer thicknesses, which would require an exposed area of 10 to the - 9 to 10 to the - 8 of the Europa surface.

For example, The GoodEReader and Autography jointly hosted an ebook signing with author HP Mallory, during which Mallory greeted fans via Spreecast, a social connectivity platform that {{allows users to}} have up to four guests on video chat at one time, to conduct Q&A sessions with even more participants, and to maintain a channel on the site, <b>thereby</b> recording and <b>storing</b> the Spreecast and assigning the recordings a URL for sharing at other outlets.|$|R

After providing a natural translation into first-order logic, we identify relationships to existing ontology languages, which yield decidability of query answering but only rough complexity bounds. By establishing {{an interesting and}} non-trivial connection to word rewriting, {{we are able to}} pinpoint the exact combined complexity of query answering in our framework and obtain tractability results for data complexity. The upper bounds are proven using a query reformu-lation technique, which can be implemented on top of key-value <b>stores,</b> <b>thereby</b> exploiting their querying facilities...|$|R
