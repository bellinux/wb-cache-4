Sinn Féin in turn argued that {{to do so would}} recognise Britain's claim over Northern Ireland, and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British-created institution. A supporter of the Scottish Parliament and political devolution, Benn however opposed the Scottish National Party and Scottish independence, saying: [...] "I think nationalism is a mistake. And I am half Scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife. The thought <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would suddenly be a foreigner would upset me very much." ...|$|E
500|$|Kajol {{describes}} herself as being [...] "extremely mischievous" [...] as a child. She added {{that she was very}} stubborn and impulsive from a very young age. Her parents separated when she was young; but according to Tanuja, Kajol was not affected by the split as [...] "we never argued in front of [...] ". In the absence of her mother, Kajol was looked after by her maternal grandmother, who [...] "never let me feel <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was away and working". According to Kajol, her mother inculcated a sense of independence in her at a very young age. Growing up between two separate cultures, she inherited her [...] "Maharashtrian pragmatism" [...] from her mother and her [...] "Bengali temperament" [...] from her father.|$|E
500|$|Following Marianna's {{death in}} 1890, it was {{reported}} in French newspapers that she had finally, on her deathbed and with Edgardo beside her, become a Christian. Edgardo refuted this: [...] "I have always ardently desired <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> embrace the Catholic faith," [...] {{he wrote in a}} letter to Le Temps, [...] "and I tried many times to get her to do so. However, that never happened". A year later, Father Pio Edgardo Mortara returned to Italy for the first time in two decades to preach in Modena. A sister and some of his brothers came out to hear his sermon, and for the rest of his life Edgardo called on his relatives whenever he was in Italy. During a 1919 sojourn in Rome he visited the House of Catechumens he had entered 61 years before. By this time he had settled at the abbey of the Canons Regular at Bouhay in Liège, Belgium. Bouhay had a sanctuary to the Virgin of Lourdes, to which Father Mortara felt a special connection, the Lourdes apparitions of 1858 having occurred in the same year as his own conversion to Christianity. Father Pio Edgardo Mortara resided at Bouhay for the rest of his life and died there on 11 March 1940, at the age of 88.|$|E

2500|$|Charles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not {{immediately}} support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: [...] "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was warm for my being sent back". His mother's failure to request his return {{was a factor in}} his dissatisfied attitude towards women.|$|E

Though greatly crushed by the final outcome of our struggle, I felt proud that I had been permitted to do my part, and even to suffer for the cause I loved.

2500|$|Crabb {{has said}} that his early {{experiences}} informed his views on welfare: [...] "The most powerful thing to me, looking back, is the way <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> went through a crisis in her life and became welfare dependent. She started working {{just a few hours}} each week, increasing her hours and then moving to a position where with extra training she was able to move into full-time work, become a car owner, and reach full economic independence." [...] He also said: [...] "I was brought up in a home where a huge amount of emphasis was put on work...so work and education as routes out of poverty were drummed into us".|$|E
2500|$|I {{think about}} my father being called ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, coming back from Vietnam and being called ‘boy’.

2500|$|A {{tradition}} {{recorded in}} 1693 is that Hathaway [...] "greatly desired" [...] {{to be buried}} with her husband.

The inscription states, [...] "Here lyeth the body of Anne wife of William Shakespeare who departed this life the 6th day of August 1623 being of the age of 67 years." [...] A Latin inscription followed which translates as [...] "Breasts, O mother, milk and life thou didst give. Woe is me– for how great a boon shall I give stones? How much rather would I pray that the good angel should move the stone so that, like Christ's body, thine image might come forth! But my prayers are unavailing. Come quickly, Christ, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> though shut within this tomb may rise again and reach the stars."

2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors {{announced}} that, since {{church members}} had repeatedly violated previous agreements, {{it would no}} longer negotiate with the church to try to prevent vicarious baptism. Speaking on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, Ernest Michel, a Holocaust survivor who reported on the Nuremberg Trials, speaking as the honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, called on the LDS Church to [...] "implement a mechanism to undo what [...] have done", and declared that the LDS Church had repeatedly violated their agreements, and that talks with Mormon leaders were now ended. Jewish groups, he said, would now turn to {{the court of public opinion}} for justice. Michel called the practice a revision of history that plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers, stating: [...] "They tell me, that my parents' Jewishness has not been altered but ... 100 years from now, how will they be able to guarantee <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father of blessed memory who lived as Jews and were slaughtered by Hitler for no other reason than they were Jews, will someday not be identified as Mormon victims of the Holocaust?" ...|$|E

Hence he specially handpicked 30 invitees include the Bachchan family, leading man Hrithik's parents Pinky and Rakesh Roshan, Hrithik Roshan's Father- in-law Sanjay Khan, Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar, Deepika Padukone, Rohan Sippy, Karan Johar, Ashutosh Gowariker, Rajkumar Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Goldie Bhel singer Kunal Ganjawala, film Maker Akbar Khan, fashion designers Sandip Khosla, Manish Malhothra, and Shahid Kapoor.

According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..."

2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E
