25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eastern}} part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 {{kilometers}} away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, it is safe <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes. The Japanese soldiers also planted several cotton trees on the area. Now, this place {{is considered one of the}} richest barangay in Dasmariñas. Many schools and colleges can be found here such as the Southern Luzon College, International English Center, Asian Trinity School, and many others. Adjacent to the place is the Emilio Aguinaldo College. Numerous subdivisions and villages are also located here.|$|E

500|$|In 1845, a {{religious}} revival {{took place in}} Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: [...] "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my savior." [...] She went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her [...] "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." [...] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly {{for only a few}} years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: [...] "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church– / I keep it, staying at Home".|$|E

500|$|In 2003, after {{a friend}} had {{received}} a script for The Principles of Lust, Guillory claims she [...] "read it and couldn't put it down, and begged to read for the part". She was impressed by director Penny Woolcock's unconventional style of shooting, without rehearsing the actors, using raw takes and improvisational performances. For the role of Juliette, Guillory performed nude in the film's sex scenes which were filmed {{during the first week}} of filming, making her somewhat nervous. She later went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of her favorite acting experiences. Afterwards, Guillory had a small role in the romantic comedy Love Actually before taking the starring role in the television miniseries Helen of Troy. The series was mostly based on Homer's epic poem Iliad and focuses on the mythological life of Helen. Helen of Troy was nominated for best miniseries at the Satellite Awards.|$|E
500|$|The series debuted to {{positive}} reviews, with critics praising both the storytelling and the artwork. Reviewer Matthew Melikhov described Ultra as [...] "a borderline romantic comedy featuring super heroines". Several reviewers drew comparisons to the Sex and the City television show, such as Mario Anima who dubbed {{the comic book}} [...] "Spandex Sex in the City". The reviews at The A.V. Club and IGN noted the Luna Brothers' skill at writing recognizably real people and capturing a character's humanity. Writing for Comics Alliance, Laura Hudson said that while lots of comics [...] "deal {{with the idea of}} superheroes as modern-day celebrities", none [...] "focus on the relentless commercialism and pitfalls of fame quite like Ultra". Anima described the internal layouts as [...] "cinematic". Although Melikhov described Ultra as [...] "entertaining", he went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "probably not worth a second read".|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story [...] "" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] that preceded [...] "These Are the Voyages..."

It was {{directed}} by Hype Williams and shot in black-and-white; the clip depicts Beyoncé and Jay-Z [...] "madly in love". The black-and-white shoot was meant to reference the work of fashion photographer Herb Ritts. Talking about the video in an iTunes Radio session, Beyoncé said, [...] "The shoot was extremely effortless and spontaneous and we completely captured {{the energy of the}} song." [...] She also went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most organic shoot she had ever done and further added: [...] "I wanted to carry this idea of being in the moment and embracing mistakes and effortlessness into the video. I wish every video was like 'Drunk '." [...] The clip was first released on the iTunes Store on the visual album itself on December 13, 2013, which contained a previously filmed music video for every song and was later uploaded to Beyoncé's Vevo channel three days later, on December 16, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Minaj briefly {{signed with}} Brooklyn group Full Force, {{in which she}} rapped in a quartet called [...] "The Hood$tars" [...] {{composed}} of Lou$tar (son of [...] "Bowlegged Lou"), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) and 7even Up. In 2004 the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, [...] "Don't Mess With", which was featured on the compilation album [...] 7even Up explained that he and Nicki weren't fans of Safaree's reggae edge that he brought to the group, and he {{even went so far}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the reason they weren't getting signed by labels. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of her songs to people in the music industry. At the time, she was managed by Debra Antney. Fendi, CEO of Brooklyn label Dirty Money Entertainment, signed Minaj to his label in 2007 under a 180-day contract. Originally adopting the stage name [...] "Nicki Maraj", she changed it to Nicki Minaj stating that [...] "My real name is Maraj. Fendi flipped it when he met me because I had such a nasty flow!

500|$|... "Brother's Little Helper", {{which was}} {{originally}} called [...] "Bart a Go Go", {{was written by}} staff writer George Meyer and directed by director Mark Kirkland. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 3, 1999. After the season 5 episode [...] "Bart's Inner Child", Meyer got [...] "a little burned out on writing scripts", so he wrote [...] "Brother's Little Helper" [...] in order to [...] "try [...] hand again". While writing the episode, Meyer was going through [...] "some psychological problems" [...] and found the episode very difficult to write. He was initially so dissatisfied with the first draft that he turned it in with a pseudonym; Vance Jericho. Co-producer Tim Long jokingly commented that the script was [...] "literally moist with contempt" [...] but went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in fact [...] "an amazing draft". The writers discussed what sort of rampage Bart would go on during the second act, and writer Matt Selman suggested that Bart obtain a tank.

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from Saw VI, but did point out his {{favorite}} and highlight of the film as the [...] "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used {{as you might expect}} it to be – which is to say, this is no James Cameron immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points". [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but said most of the film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series". [...] Scheck went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "unfortunate" [...] the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an [...] "exceedingly bland stand-in". He called the visual impact of the 3D [...] "negligible".|$|E
500|$|Homer and Bart say the car {{was stolen}} in the church parking lot. The next morning they are {{surprised}} however to learn that Groundskeeper Willie was arrested for stealing the car, as he matched the description they gave of the carjacker as a [...] "foreign loner with wild, bushy hair". Not wanting to admit they were conned, Homer and Bart go along with Marge's theory. At the trial, the Blue Haired Lawyer leads Homer <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Willie who stole the car. After Willie is proven guilty, he snatches Wiggum's gun and shoots Principal Skinner. At this point Homer finally confesses that he got conned but Marge and the townspeople themselves tell Homer and Bart that they set up the trial and the carjacking to teach them a lesson on conning people, revealing that Skinner was not really shot (it was a fake blood pack), the judge was Grampa wearing a latex mask, and the con man who stole their car was an actor called Devon Bradley. As Lisa is ready {{to explain why the}} town, media and police officials had [...] "nothing better to do" [...] than show them the consequences of their actions, Otto runs through the courtroom doors, shouting, 'Surf's Up!'. The scene then cuts to Springfield at the beach, with characters from the episode surfing, including the waiter from the restaurant, the two astronauts from the Mir space station and the sturgeon swimming in the sea.|$|E
500|$|Skyfall {{received}} [...] "generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans", {{according to the}} GlobalPost. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 349 reviewers and judged 93% of the reviews to be positive, while the film scored 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 49 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". A number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for The Times, Philip French, writing in The Observer, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the Irish Independent and the Daily Record, all asked whether Skyfall was the best Bond film produced. The Daily Telegraphs film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered Skyfall to be [...] "often dazzling, always audacious", with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter thought that Skyfall was [...] "dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor", going on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a film that had [...] "some weight and complexity to it". Variety Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to put as much focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention, while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for The New York Times, considered Skyfall to be [...] "a superior follow-up to Casino Royale" [...] which is [...] "opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key". Kim Newman, reviewing the film for Empire, concluded, [...] "Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but {{with the sense of}} fun that hasn't always been evident lately". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] "a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon". Reviewing for the New Statesman, Ryan Gilbey saw that [...] "nostalgia permeates the movie", going on to say that [...] "sometimes the old ways are the best".|$|E
