40|$|Using a novel dataset {{on changes}} in capital {{controls}} and currency-based prudential measures in 17 major emerging market economies (EMEs) over the period 2001 - 2011, this paper provides new evidence on domestic and multilateral (or spillover) effects of capital controls {{before and after the}} global financial crisis. Our results, based on panel VARs, suggest that capital control actions do not allow countries to avoid the trade-offs of the monetary policy trilemma. Where they have a desired impact on the trilemma variables 2 ̆ 013 net capital inflows, monetary policy autonomy and the exchange rate 2 ̆ 013 the size of that impact is generally small. While we find some evidence of effectiveness before the global financial crisis, the usefulness of these measures weakened in the post-crisis environment of abundant global liquidity and relatively strong economic growth in EMEs. Our results also show that capital control policies can have unintended consequences, as resident outflows offset the impact of capital control actions on gross inflows (or vice versa). These findings highlight the importance of the macroeconomic context and of the increasing role of resident flows in understanding the effectiveness of capital inflow management. Using panel near-VARs, we find significant spillovers of capital control actions in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to other EMEs during the 2000 s. Spillover effects were more important {{in the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis than before the crisis, and arose from inflow <b>tightening</b> <b>actions,</b> rather than outflow easing measures. The channels through which these policies spilled over to other countries were exchange rates as well as capital flows (especially cross-border bank lending). Spillovers seem to be more prevalent in Latin America than in Asia, reflecting the greater role of cross-border banking and more open capital accounts in the former countries. These results are robust to various specifications of our models...|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} concerns {{an inflatable}} seal assembly adapted {{for use with}} a bayonet quick-disconnect system particularly useful for the insulated transfer of cryogenic consumables in orbit (such as between a space station and a re-supply vehicle). The zero-leak cryogenic coupling includes a polymeric seal clamped to a male bayonet member with two pairs of tightening rings. The tightening rings threadably engage each other in respective pairs around tapered ends of the inflatable seal member so that a wedging <b>action</b> <b>tightens</b> the seal member about the male bayonet. Once in place, the seal may be inflated via an inflation port so that its expansion provides pressure contact with the inside surface of a coaxial female member...|$|R
25|$|Cooper felt Creelman's {{final draft}} was slow-paced, {{too full of}} flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition, and written {{on a scale that}} would have been prohibitively {{expensive}} to film. Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and <b>tightening</b> the <b>action.</b> Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production. Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether <b>tightening</b> and easing <b>actions</b> of the Federal Reserve symmetrically influence currency markets. Using daily data on four exchange rates from 1989 to 2001, {{we find that}} changes in the Fed's interest rate target are positively related {{to changes in the}} value of the dollar. Surprises associated with monetary tightening have a larger announcement effect as compared to monetary easing for the British pound, German mark, and Canadian dollar, whereas the opposite is true for the Japanese yen. The results appear to be driven by the reactions of foreign central banks to Fed actions, the Fed's credibility as a policymaker, and by the change in the Fed's disclosure policy beginning in 1994.

25|$|The {{most famous}} {{adaptation}} of La Tosca was Giacomo Puccini's Italian opera Tosca which premiered in Rome on 14 January 1900 with Hariclea Darclée {{in the title}} role and went on to successful premieres in London, New York, and Paris. The Paris premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1903 was performed in a French translation by Paul Ferrier with Sardou himself taking charge of the rehearsals. Unlike Sardou's play, Puccini's opera has achieved an enduring popularity. More than 100 years after its premiere, Tosca ranks sixth in the list of most frequently performed operas worldwide, and has over 100 commercial recordings as well as several film versions (see Tosca discography). Puccini had seen La Tosca in Italy when Bernhardt toured the play there and asked his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, to negotiate with Sardou for the adaptation rights. Before Puccini obtained the rights, the composers Alberto Franchetti and Giuseppe Verdi had both expressed interest in turning La Tosca into an opera, although Verdi thought the ending had to be changed. Puccini's librettists, Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, likewise tried (unsuccessfully) to convince Sardou to accept a new ending, with Tosca going mad rather than committing suicide. The Sardou ending stayed, but Illica and Giacosa did make several significant changes to the play, primarily to <b>tighten</b> the <b>action.</b>|$|R
25|$|Gershwin's {{first version}} of the opera, running four hours (counting the two intermissions), was {{performed}} privately in a concert version in Carnegie Hall, {{in the fall of}} 1935. He chose as his choral director Eva Jessye, who also directed her own renowned choir. The world premiere performance took place at the Colonial Theatre in Boston on September 30, 1935—the try-out for a work intended initially for Broadway where the opening took place at the Alvin Theatre in New York City on October 10, 1935. During rehearsals and in Boston, Gershwin made many cuts and refinements to shorten the running time and <b>tighten</b> the dramatic <b>action.</b> The run on Broadway lasted 124 performances. The production and direction were entrusted to Rouben Mamoulian, who had previously directed the Broadway productions of Heyward's play Porgy. The music director was Alexander Smallens. The leading roles were played by Todd Duncan and Anne Brown. The influential vaudeville artist John W. Bubbles created the role of Sportin' Life; the role of Serena was created by Ruby Elzy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{graveyard}} spiral {{is associated}} with a return to level flight following an intentional or unintentional prolonged bank turn. For example, a pilot who enters a banking turn to the left will initially have a sensation of a turn in the same direction. If the left turn continues (~20 seconds or more), the pilot will experience the sensation that the airplane is no longer turning to the left. At this point, if the pilot attempts to level the wings this action will produce a sensation that the airplane is turning and banking in the opposite direction (to the right), a sensation commonly known as [...] "the leans". If the pilot believes the illusion of a right turn (which can be very compelling), he/she will re-enter the original left turn in an attempt to counteract the sensation of a right turn. If the pilot fails to recognize the illusion and does not level the wings, the airplane will continue turning left and losing altitude. Because an aircraft tends to lose altitude in turns unless the pilot compensates for the loss in lift, the pilot may notice a loss of altitude. The absence of any sensation of turning creates the illusion of being in a level descent. The pilot may pull back on the controls in an attempt to climb or stop the descent. This <b>action</b> <b>tightens</b> the spiral and increases the loss of altitude.|$|R
