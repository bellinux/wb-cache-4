5000|$|Skrepenak had {{considered}} running for Don Sherwood's United States House of Representatives seat that was contested and won by Chris Carney in the 2006 elections.

5|$|Driehaus {{had been}} the choice of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Campaign</b> Committee (DCCC) to run in Ohio's 1st congressional {{district}} for the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, but he {{decided to run for}} re-election in his Ohio House of Representatives seat.

Emanuel led <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party's effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. The documentary [...] HouseQuake, featuring Emanuel, chronicles those elections. Emanuel had disagreements over Democratic election strategy with Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean.

5000|$|In the 2014 {{election}} cycle, McKenzie was <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> nominee in Michigan's 11th congressional district.

[...] In December 2013, the DCCC added McKenzie to its elite jump starter program. McKenzie won <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> nomination in <b>the</b> primary on August 5, 2014. In late September 2014, The Hill named McKenzie one of five sleeper races to watch in the country. The DCCC had reserved 1 million dollars in media ad buys for McKenzie for the general election.

5|$|With {{incumbent}} U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt {{choosing to}} retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election.

On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary. Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In {{the wake of the}} Tea Party movement and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. <b>The</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Campaign</b> Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents in the November 2 election.|$|E
