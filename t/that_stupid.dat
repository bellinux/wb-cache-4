He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the jurors in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there and stare at you and have <b>that</b> <b>stupid</b> grin on his face. He would make your skin crawl." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{explanation}} {{given for}} Kenny's deaths and reappearances {{was given in}} [...] "Cartman Joins NAMBLA", wherein the McCormicks have a baby exactly like Kenny, including the characteristic orange parka, shortly after the former Kenny dies. Mr. McCormick exclaims, [...] "God, {{this must be the}} fiftieth time this has happened", to which Mrs. McCormick quickly replies, [...] "Fifty-second". This explanation is expanded upon in the Season 14 episodes [...] "", [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] and [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends", in which Kenny, while playing superheroes with his friends, claims his [...] "super power" [...] is immortality. He actually dies several times during these episodes—even committing suicide more than once—reawakening alive and unharmed in his bed each time. He is frustrated and angry that no one can remember him dying every time he regenerates, and longs to know the source of his power, which he views as a curse. Unbeknownst to him, his parents were previously connected to a Cthulhu-worshipping death cult. After Kenny shoots himself the second time, Mrs. McCormick awakes with a scream, shrieks [...] "It's happening again!", and minutes later, is shown gently placing a newborn Kenny in his bed. [...] "We should never have gone to <b>that</b> <b>stupid</b> cult meeting," [...] she grouses as she and her husband return to bed.|$|E
2500|$|According to Hendrix and Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross, {{the growing}} {{importance}} of the media—Internet, television and magazines—and the response to an interview of Cobain's mother were jointly responsible for such theories. An excerpt from a statement that Cobain's mother, Wendy Fradenburg Cobain O'Connor, made in the Aberdeen, Washington newspaper The Daily World—"Now he's gone and joined <b>that</b> <b>stupid</b> club. I {{told him not to}} join <b>that</b> <b>stupid</b> club."—referred to Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison dying at the same age, according to Cross. Other authors share his view. On the other hand, Eric Segalstad, writer of , assumed that Cobain's mother referred to the death of his two uncles and his great-uncle, all of whom had also committed suicide. According to Cross, the events have led a [...] "set of conspiracy theorists [...] the absurd notion that Kurt Cobain intentionally timed his death so he could join the 27 Club".|$|E
2500|$|In early 2001 All Saints broke up, and Lewis later {{explained}} that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: [...] "I would never {{in a million years}} have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident. But when that incident happened, it fired up so strong, it had to be over.

2500|$|Although {{no longer}} holding {{a seat in}} Parliament, Streitman was one of Romania's delegates to the 25th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, while also {{representing}} Romania within a journalists' version of the Little Entente, alongside Filotti and Emil Fagure.

Goga cited his admiration for Streitman against those who reproached him his antisemitism: [...] "I have never professed <b>that</b> <b>stupid</b> kind of intolerance." [...] At the time, Streitman also advised and financed his friend Șeicaru {{to set up the}} nationalist daily, Curentul. In its original edition, this political tribune employed other Jewish men of letters, among them F. Brunea-Fox and Moses Rosen. In 1930, Streitman launched a new magazine of his own, the short-lived Observatorul Politic și Social ("Political and Social Observer").|$|E

[...] His fellow whites, he insisted, must [...] "reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites...
