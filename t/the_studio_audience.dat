5|$|As with Joking Apart, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk {{for independent}} production company Pola Jones. The positive reaction of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> during {{recording of the}} first series in 1996 propelled executives to commission {{a second set of}} six episodes before the first batch had aired.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} good {{reaction}} of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Television variety {{shows are}} the widest venue for popular music. They change often, but Buona Domenica, Domenica In, and I raccomandati are popular. The longest running musical {{broadcast}} in Italy is La Corrida, a three-hour weekly program of amateurs and would-be musicians. It {{started on the}} radio in 1968 and moved to TV in 1988. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> bring cow-bells and sirens and are encouraged to show good-natured disapproval. The city with {{the highest number of}} rock concerts (of national and international artists) is Milan, with a number close to the other European music capitals, as Paris, London and Berlin.|$|E
50|$|The judges {{scores were}} added to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> votes to decide the winner. No public vote took place, as the {{programme}} was recorded earlier in the year.|$|R

5|$|All of the {{location}} shots were filmed {{at the beginning of}} the production block. Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director's home. The stand-up sequences were filmed in the Café Des Artistes on London's Fulham Road, now known as the Valmont Club, and were shot for the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version. Robert Bathurst has complained that, in order to save £5,000, this promised reshoot never materialised. The close ups of Bathurst were filmed in the studio for the second series, with stock footage of the club's audience reused.|$|E
5|$|Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk, {{the series}} {{that the writer}} had pitched {{to him at the}} beginning of the decade. Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis, the show was based on Moffat's three years as an English teacher. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired. However, it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997, who had taken exception to the BBC's publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refuses to even name the series, joking that he might get attacked in the street.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 2009, Griffin {{took part}} in the BBC's topical debate programme, Question Time, as a {{representative}} of the BNP. He appeared alongside Bonnie Greer, Jack Straw, Baroness Warsi and Chris Huhne. He was challenged by members of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> and questioned by host David Dimbleby on comments he had previously made on the Holocaust. He was also critical of Islam. His invitation followed the election of two BNP MEPs to the European Parliament, and led to significant debate over the merits of the BBC's decision. The appearance sparked a protest outside the BBC Television Centre prior to the recording of the programme, in which an estimated 500 people picketed the front entrance of the complex, many chanting anti-Nazi slogans and others trying to break into the building to stop the programme being filmed. Some got past the police and security, but were expelled. Six protesters were arrested, and three police officers were injured, one needing hospital treatment.|$|E

50|$|Episodes {{were mostly}} filmed {{in front of}} a live <b>studio</b> <b>{{audience}}</b> at Teddington <b>Studios</b> in London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on Wednesday evenings. Sue Vertue says that the live audience reinvigorated the company because no one had laughed at the material for a few days as everyone knew it so well. A warm-up comedian updated <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> about any important plot detail, introduced them to the performers, and provided entertainment while cameras and sets were being repositioned. Rob Rouse fulfilled this role for the fourth series.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the show}} {{is meant to be}} competitive, judges have been harsh to contestants that they [...] "ding" [...] out, and often make fun of them directly. A laugh track is heavily used {{instantly}} whenever one-liners or off-key singing was present, supplementing <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience's</b> reactions. But sometimes it happens whenever spot-on singing happens if the contestant has an unusual appearance. Note that most Hong Kong variety shows use laugh tracks heavily for network purposes.|$|R

25|$|In 1997, {{a special}} episode was taped in which <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> was {{composed}} solely of grade-school age children, primarily 5–10 years of age. Conan interacted with the children, {{encouraging them to}} laugh and cheer to keep away the boredom monster.|$|E

50|$|She also {{competed in}} the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special 2008, dancing the Jive with Brian Fortuna, Brendan Cole having to compete with his later partner Lisa Snowdon. Brook and Fortuna were put into fourth place, but with <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience's</b> vote they came second to Jill Halfpenny and Darren Bennett.In 2008, Brook took Jennifer Ellison's place {{as one of the}} three judges on the second series of the reality TV {{programme}} Dirty Dancing: The Time of Your Life, broadcast between September and November 2008.|$|R
50|$|In the 1998 version, {{expectations}} were high with {{the hopes that}} the film would become a big summer hit. Christopher finished his cut of the film and <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> scheduled <b>the</b> film's release for July of the following year. After initial positive reactions within the company, early test screenings for the two-hour cut of the film disappointed <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> <b>Audiences</b> found <b>the</b> characters unlikable and reacted negatively to a kiss between Shane and Greg. They also did not respond well to the happy ending {{for both of them}} and Anita. Miramax requested cuts be made and Christopher initially refused.|$|R
50|$|A DVD {{of all of}} the {{sketches}} featured in the show 'Saturday Night Live' was released in 2009. However the Kinky Sex episode is taken from a home video source as the original could not be found. Some of {{the sketches}} appear to be edited longer and slight shorter than others. Music edits have also been made, of which some are obvious if you have seen the video. The laughing in the unseen audience is also different, where the video used <b>the</b> real <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> laughter and also canned laughter. The DVD just uses <b>the</b> original <b>studio</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> DVD is also known to be very hard to find in retail shops.|$|R
25|$|Rover also {{achieved}} television immortality by relieving himself – live to air – {{upon one}} of the huge cameras. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> collapsed in hysterics, but the duration and urgency of Rover's impressively hydraulic performance might have led some cynics to question just how impromptu the event really was.|$|E
25|$|Audience Poll: The host {{repeats the}} {{question}} to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience.</b> When requested, the audience must now press a button {{in front of them}} within ten seconds to indicate which option they think is correct answer.

25|$|When {{the show}} was relaunched on the BBC in 1998, the star guest on the first {{programme}} was Sir Anthony Hopkins, who demonstrated his talent for mimicry by telling several Tommy Cooper jokes. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> was very appreciative, and Parkinson was visibly gratified to the actor for getting his new series {{off to a good}} start.|$|E

50|$|The programme, {{since its}} revamp, has {{followed}} the format of other late night programmes, most notably from the United States, such as The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in which Cameron comes out and speaks to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> and greets them (usually with handshakes) before talking to them. After doing so, Cameron then introduces the first guest and interviews them and interviews the second guest. Rather than live music, {{at the end of}} the programme, a music video is usually shown of a band whilst the end credits role.|$|R

25|$|In December 2013, Kovalev was {{partnered with}} West End star Elaine Paige during the 2013 Strictly Christmas Special.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015, Coulter {{appeared}} on Real Time with Bill Maher and predicted {{that of all the}} declared Republican primary candidates, Donald Trump had the best chance of winning the general election, prompting <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> to laugh in disbelief. Coulter later endorsed Donald Trump in the general election, which he went on to win.|$|E
25|$|The first filmed {{pilot was}} {{produced}} in April 1991, with Frances Fisher playing Jill Taylor. Fisher, primarily known as a dramatic actress, was well qualified for the co-starring role but was viewed by <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> as not being comedic enough, and too serious in her line delivery. The producers tried to work with Fisher on adapting to the situation comedy setting, but shortly after the pilot wrapped post-production, they decided to recast her.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club critics {{discussed}} this episode in 2012. Phil Nugent found this episode unfunny and {{intended as a}} message to tolerate homosexuals by making Norm and other regulars appear [...] "ridiculous". Noel Murray said that the episode's [...] "bifurcated structure" [...] prevented more development for Sam's old baseball team mate, and Murray found [...] "stereotypes" [...] of gay men dated. Nevertheless, Murray and Donna Bowman considered it to be more about men securing their own machismo than their tolerating homosexuality. Ryan McGee found <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience's</b> reactions for this episode ambiguous, especially years after this episode aired.|$|R
50|$|Clinton {{developed}} his singing career {{under the direction}} of Arkansas' music impresario and manager Butch Stone. He gained professional experience by singing warm-ups for <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> at tapings of the sitcom Designing Women, as well as by working as a lounge singer. As a result of a deal struck by Stone and music-industry attorney Stann Findelle, Clinton was initially contracted to Atlantic Records in 1992. His first album, Nothing Good Comes Easy, was released in September 1993 on the Pyramid/Atlantic/Rhino label. In December 1999, Clinton and his band paid a visit to Pyongyang, performing alongside North and South Korean musical acts.|$|R
5000|$|The German-born comedian Henning Wehn has a {{distinctive}} clipped German accent which he plays for comedy value. He {{tends to be}} given subjects that a stereotypical German would know nothing about, such as a sense of humour or, most recently (in Episode 6 of Series 12), [...] "The British". Wehn rarely wins, but has <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>audience's</b> sympathy with <b>the</b> British stereotype of backing the underdog; these stereotypes are played for laughs and are not meant or taken as racism. He also usually introduces his talk with a mention of how something was invented by Jesus.|$|R
