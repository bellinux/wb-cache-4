25|$|The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, {{signed on}} February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican {{plenipotentiary}} representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.–Mexican {{border of the}} Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among {{the people of the}} state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, Ángel Trías sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with Ángel Trías, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican–American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.|$|E

[...] It also led the owners to dismiss league president John Ziegler and replace him on an interim basis with Gil Stein. [...] Goodenow called the strike a major moment, stating [...] "I don't think the owners took the players seriously and it wasn't until the strike that <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> players were serious." [...] As part of the deal, the league also agreed to have each team play two games per season for the following two years in neutral site locations, partially to help gauge markets for potential expansion.|$|E
500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. [...] Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors {{did not ask for}} such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which meant nothing to Iraqis. The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.|$|E
