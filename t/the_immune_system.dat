5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. <b>The</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving an arm of <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> {{adaptive}} <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> {{also known}} as <b>the</b> acquired <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> or, more rarely, as <b>the</b> specific <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> is a subsystem of <b>the</b> overall <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. <b>The</b> adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{is one of the}} two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being <b>the</b> innate <b>immune</b> <b>system).</b> Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|R

One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

5|$|Clearly, some tumors evade <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{and go on}} {{to become}} cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E

In humans, immunodeficiency can either {{be the result of}} a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> {{as well as its}} inducibility.

5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> are inactive. The ability of <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
