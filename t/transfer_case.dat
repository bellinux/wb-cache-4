50|$|Chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> use a {{chain to}} drive most often only one axle, but can drive both axles. Chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are quieter and lighter than gear-driven ones. They {{are used in}} {{vehicles}} such as compact trucks, full size trucks, Jeeps and SUVs. Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases,</b> accepting the additional weight and noise to gain the extra strength they generally provide.|$|R

25|$|Motive {{power is}} {{provided}} by a digitally-controlled Gale Banks Engineering 866T V-8 diesel, this based on {{the architecture of the}} General Motors (GM) Duramax. Power output is undisclosed, but estimated to be around 300 hp. In commercial use power output of the standard Duramax engine is currently up to 397hp (296kW) at 3000 rpm. An unspecified fully automatic Allison Transmission is fitted, this coupled to an Oshkosh <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> It is currently not known if this is a single-speed or two-speed (high/low ratio) <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 5-speed manual Fuller {{transmission}} had a {{very low}} 1st gear, was direct in 4th and had an overdrive 5th. A separate 2-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> also engaged or disengaged the front axle.|$|E

An Eaton Automatic Differential Lock was optional for the rear hypoid differential.|$|E
25|$|A 5-speed manual {{transmission}} {{with a very}} low 1st and an overdrive 5th gear was used. A <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> had a high and low range, a neutral for power take-off operation, and engaged the front axle. Axles were Timken double reduction “pumpkin” type.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{different}} types of internal power-transfer mechanism found in most <b>transfer</b> <b>cases.</b> Gear-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> use sets of gears to drive either the front or both the front and rear driveshafts. These are generally strong, heavy units that are used in large trucks, but there are currently several gear drive cases in production for passenger cars.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{inverted}} tooth drive chains {{are commonly used}} in passenger car and light truck <b>transfer</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|R
50|$|All Dana 18s have {{front and}} rear outputs offset {{to the right side}}. Most {{vehicles}} built with a Dana 18 have the rear axle offset to the right side to accommodate this. Most other <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> used in Jeeps have a centered rear output that lines up with the input shaft. The Dana 18 always has gears turning, which makes it noisier then some other <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> when in two-wheel-drive mode.|$|R
25|$|A Fuller 4-speed manual non-synchronized {{transmission}} with a {{very low}} 1st and direct 4th gear was used. A Timken <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> had a high and low range, a neutral for power take-off (PTO) operation, and engaged the front axle. Rear axles were Timken double reduction “pumpkin” type, tractors had heavier rear axles.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} powered by a Leyland 313 {{turbocharged}} water-cooled four-stroke diesel engine coupled to a five-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox and two-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> There is permanent (4 × 4) drive. The front axle has a rating of 5,000kg, with an offset bowl to reduce overall cab height. The rear axle has a rating of 7,500kg.|$|E

5000|$|The {{heavy duty}} Ford C6 3-speed {{automatic}} transmission, marketed as the [...] "Select-Shift" [...] automatic, was the standard automatic transmission all years and came paired with most engine options if ordered. Various <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> were used, most built by New Process Gear. NP205 and NP208F cases were most common. Each feature a stick-shift 4WD engagement, with 4 speeds: 4 Low, 4 High, Neutral and 2 High. Various Borg-Warner <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> were also used.|$|R
50|$|All {{wheel drive}} <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> can be fitted to the AWTF-80 SC, making it {{ideal for use}} in {{cross-over}} type SUVs.|$|R
25|$|Four-wheel drive, {{also called}} 4×4 ("four by four") or 4WD refers to {{type of a}} vehicle, {{specifically}} one with its drivetrain capable of providing torque to all wheel ends of a two-axled vehicle simultaneously. It may be full-time, or on-demand, and is typically linked via a <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> which provides an additional output drive-shaft, along with additional gear ranges.|$|E
25|$|American Motors {{introduced}} the open differential Model 128 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> for the Eagle. The automatic transmission {{no longer had}} a lockup torque converter. Eagle sales would drop beneath the 10,000 annual unit mark for the first time for 1986 (and would slide further for its remaining two seasons on the market), as the car was aging due to its seven-season life atop a platform that debuted for 1970.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the Japanese company Tokyu Kurogane Kogyo built {{approximately}} 4,700 four-wheel-drive roadsters, {{called the}} Type 95 {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army from 1937 until 1944, used during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Three different bodystyles were manufactured; a 2-door roadster, a 2-door pickup truck and a 4-door phaeton, all equipped with a <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> that engaged the front wheels, powered by a 1.3 litre, 2-cylinder, air-cooled OHV V-twin engine.|$|E

25|$|The Oshkosh 1070F {{shares a}} common chassis and axle set-up with the M1070A0 model, but {{the cab and}} all major {{driveline}} components have been substantially revised to meet both performance and legislative requirements. The driveline {{is similar to that}} fitted to the M1070A1 and consists of a Caterpillar C-18 diesel engine developing 700 hp, this coupled to an Allison HD 4076P automatic transmission and TC-561 torque converter, coupled to an Oshkosh 30000 single-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
25|$|On-Demand Mode - In {{this mode}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{operates}} {{primarily in the}} 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, {{as described in the}} section on traction control systems.|$|E
25|$|M3E2/M5 Half-track – International Harvester Half-Track, {{externally}} largely {{identical to}} the M3, but with , IHC RED-450-B engine, different drive train and fuel and electrical system. In fact, only the chassis, bogies, track, idler and drive sprockets, wheels, winches, <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> rollers, and machine gun mount were interchangeable. The M5 is heavier than the M3, {{due in part to}} heavier armor. Its body was welded, rather than bolted. The M5 was primarily for Lend-Lease, to Britain, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union.|$|E
