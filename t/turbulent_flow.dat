25|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} Navier–Stokes equations for <b>turbulent</b> <b>flow</b> is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales {{that are involved in}} <b>turbulent</b> <b>flow,</b> the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or direct numerical simulation. Attempts to solve <b>turbulent</b> <b>flow</b> using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the Spalart–Allmaras, –, –, and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations.
