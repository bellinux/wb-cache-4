40|$|The {{performance}} of a hydraulic motor is strongly influenced by the timing, leakage, and friction of the valves connecting to the pressure and <b>tank</b> <b>ports.</b> For {{the application of a}} linkage-based hydraulic piston motor, a novel clearance sealed cylindrical rotary valve is introduced. A model of the cylinder pressure dynamics is formulated from bulk modulus definition and solved using a variable-step Runge-Kutta stiff solver. Energy loss equations are developed and used to aid the creation of objective functions. A geometric optimization of the motoring efficiency is conducted based on coupled relationships: including throttling across the transitioning and fully open valve ports, viscous friction, and leakage, but excluding piston related losses. A simple genetic algorithm is used to obtain optimized geometry, and a theoretical syste...|$|E
50|$|The {{alignment}} of Route 185 originates as Alternative F-1 and G-1 of the Liberty Harbor - Route 169 Feeder Arterial, proposed in 1977 during {{the construction of}} the New Jersey Route 169. The alignment was supposed to fork off of Route 169 near Interchange 14A on the Newark Bay Extension, and parallel the extension through the Greenville Railroad Yards. The alignment would parallel Caven Point Road to the south and through the Metropolitan <b>Tank</b> <b>Port</b> before ending at Interchange 14B in Jersey City. The alignment. The original alignment proposed, Alternative G-4, was to have the freeway run along the {{alignment of}} Caven Point Road parallel to the Newark Bay Extension into the Metropolitan <b>Tank</b> <b>Port,</b> but prior to the Final Environmental Impact Statement, the proposal was dropped. The alignment was designed to help serve existing and proposed industry and divert truck traffic from local streets. The alignment of the new arterial was proposed to be 2.75 mi with four travel lanes (two in each direction) designed for hourly volume of 3090 vehicles.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{the method}} of {{actuation}} and the return method can also be specified. A hypothetical valve could be specified as 4-way, 3-position direction control valve or 4/3 DCV since there are four ports and three switching positions for the valve. In this example, one port is called the pressure port which {{is connected to the}} pump; one <b>port</b> is the <b>tank</b> <b>port</b> and is connected to the tank (or reservoir); and the two remaining ports are called working ports and are connected to the actuator. Apart from characteristics of valve the fluid suitable for valve, working temperature and viscosity also thought upon before selecting a particular type of valve.|$|R
50|$|The {{large scale}} {{petrochemical}} manufacturing locations have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations, storage <b>tanks,</b> <b>port</b> facilities, road and rail terminals. In the United Kingdom for example, there are 4 main locations for such manufacturing: near the River Mersey in Northwest England, on the Humber on the East coast of Yorkshire, in Grangemouth near the Firth of Forth in Scotland and in Teesside {{as part of}} the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). To demonstrate the clustering and integration, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the NEPIC industry cluster companies in Teesside.|$|R
500|$|A Board of Inquiry {{investigated}} the crash {{and found it}} was caused by loss of power from Nos. 1 and 2 engines, both mounted on the port wing. George Ward told the House of Commons that [...] "the four fuel <b>tanks</b> on the <b>port</b> side of the Beverley feed into a collector box from which the two port engines are fed. From the available evidence, including inspections of part of the aircraft's fuel system, {{it is clear that}} a non-return valve between No. 1 (<b>port)</b> <b>tank</b> and the collector box had been fitted in reverse and that the fuel supply from Nos. 3 and 4 (<b>port)</b> <b>tanks</b> were switched off throughout the flight." [...] Ward continued, saying that the loss of power from No. 1 was caused by it being shut down as a precautionary measure, and the fuel starvation to No. 2 engine was caused by an incorrectly fitted non-return valve in the supply line from No. 1 fuel tank. No. 2 fuel tank had been isolated and two smaller fuel <b>tanks</b> in the <b>port</b> wing had not been selected during the flight.|$|R

40|$|The work {{examines}} an onboard auxiliary unit {{powered by}} a Stirling engine that can produce fresh water through a thermal desalination plant and recharge the service batteries with surplus electricity. In small boats fresh water requirements are met either by filling the water <b>tanks</b> at <b>ports</b> or by producing it onboard. However, both currently available technologies, i. e. reverse osmosis and thermal desalination plants, consume electricity and involve {{a certain amount of}} noise from the power unit. Nearly noiseless operation makes Stirling engines well suited for mounting on sailing boats. This work studies a 1 kWe Stirling engine coupled to a reverse osmosis or to a thermal desalination plant. Since both designs use thermal energy recovered from the Stirling engine, to reduce water dynamic viscosity (reverse omosis plant) or for water evaporation (thermal plant), the main design differences lie in how heat is transferred to the salt water. A technical and economic analysis is also provided, comparing the performances and cost of the two plant solutions...|$|R
