50|$|The {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) are either rod-shaped (bacillus), or spherical (coccus), and are characterized by an increased <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> (low pH range). This aspect helps LAB to outcompete other bacteria in a natural fermentation, as they can withstand the increased acidity from organic acid production (e.g., lactic acid). Laboratory media used for LAB typically include a carbohydrate source, as most species are incapable of respiration. LAB are catalase negative. They consist of the organelles of a simple bacterial structure. LAB are amongst the most important groups of microorganisms used in the food industry.|$|E

Breeding for <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity</b> {{provides a}} permanent, environmentally friendly, and inexpensive {{solution to the}} problem. This study was carried out to determine {{the relative importance of}} additive, dominant, and epistatic effects on maize grain-yields in different tropical genotypes. Divergent selection in three populations (SA 4, SA 5, and SA 7) provided inbred lines tolerant or sensitive to acid soils. The tolerant and sensitive lines from each population were used to obtain the F 1, F 2, F 3, back-crosses, second back-crosses, and selfed back-cross generations. In addition, the tolerant lines from SA 4 and SA 5 were crossed with a sensitive line from the Tuxpeño Sequía population, from which the same generations were also derived. All generations from each of the five sets of crosses were evaluated in three acid-soil environments and one non-acid-soil environment. A generation-mean analysis was performed on each set for yield. The sequential sum of squares associated with additive, dominance, and digenic epistatic effects were used to estimate the relative importance of each genetic effect. Epistasis was not important in any set in the non-acid-soil environment, with dominance accounting for 80. 76 % of the total variation among generation means across sets. In acid-soil environments, epistasis was more important. The relative importance of digenic epistasis was greater in those evaluations with large experimental errors. The tolerant line from population SA 5 was prone to severe root lodging, suggesting a very poor root system. Apparently, the <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity</b> in this line is not associated with a large root system. Peer-reviewe...|$|R

In this study, we evaluated the adaptation <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity</b> in common local upland rice varieties {{from an area}} with acidic soil in Thailand. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>to</b> hydrogen and aluminium (Al) toxicity was determined by measuring root growth, plant dry weight and phosphorus (P) uptake in aerated solution culture without the supplementation of Al (0 mg/l) at pH 7 and 4 and with the supplementation of 10, 20 and 30 mg Al/l at pH 4. The root growth of upland rice plants grown from farmers' seed was depressed less by Al than that of common wetland rice varieties. Pure-line genotypes of upland rice varieties were differentiated into several classes of Al tolerance, with frequency distribution of the classes that sometimes differed between the accessions of the same varieties. The effect of Al tolerance on root length was closely correlated with depression by Al in root dry weight and whole-plant P content.

40|$|Lactobacillus bulgaricus is a {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) that, through the production of lactic acid, gradually acidifies its environment during growth. In {{the course of this}} process, L. bulgaricus acquires an improved <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity.</b> A survey of the recently established genome sequence shows that this bacterium possesses few of the pH control functions that have been described in other LAB and raises the question of what other mechanisms could be involved in its adaptation to the decreasing environmental pH. In some bacteria other than LAB, ion transport systems have been implicated in acid adaptation. We therefore studied the expression of this type of transport system during acid adaptation in L. bulgaricus by reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR and mapped transcription start sites. Intriguingly, the most significantly induced were three ATPases carrying the CPX signature of heavy-metal transporters. Protein homology and the presence of a conserved sequence motif in the promoter regions of the genes encoding these proteins strongly suggest that they are involved in copper homeostasis. Induction of this system is thought to assist in avoiding indirect damage that could result from medium acidification...|$|E

Under near-future scenarios of ocean acidification, the swimming behaviour of marine invertebrate sperm is altered. We tested whether {{this was due to}} changes in sperm mitochondrial activity by investigating the effects of ocean acidification on sperm metabolism and swimming behaviour in the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii. We used a fluorescent molecular probe (JC- 1) and flow cytometry to visualize mitochondrial activity (measured as change in mitochondrial membrane potential, MMP). Sperm MMP was significantly reduced in delta pH - 0. 3 (35 % reduction) and delta pH - 0. 5 (48 % reduction) treatments, whereas sperm swimming behaviour was less sensitive with only slight changes (up to 11 % decrease) observed overall. There was significant inter-individual variability in responses of sperm swimming behaviour and MMP to acidified seawater. We suggest it is likely that sperm exposed to these changes in pH are close to their tipping point in terms of physiological <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity.</b> Importantly, substantial inter-individual variation in responses of sperm swimming to ocean acidification may increase the scope for selection of resilient phenotypes, which, if heritable, could provide a basis for adaptation to future ocean acidification...|$|E

The aim of this work was to estimate the tolerance of benthic macroinvertebrates to water acidification. Four sampling stations were established in the sub-basin of the Grande River, three of them (G 1, G 2 and G 3) on the Grande River and one (C) in one of its tributaries, the Carolina Stream, which receives the acid drainage of an abandoned gold mine. Sample collection (n = 24) was carried out with a Surber net and recorded bimonthly between May 1997 and December 1998.

They are predatory fish that feed on plankton, insects, and sometimes small amphibians. They can breathe on land for short periods of time because they have accessory respiratory organs through which they can use atmospheric oxygen to breathe. During wet weather, they can survive on land for more than four days, but if their bodies dry up, they die because it become difficult for them to exchange atmospheric oxygen. They are hardy fish that can survive environmental changes and have a good <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> high <b>acidity</b> in water. The Ceylon snakehead is, according to existing reports, a mouth brooder like many Channa species. The male carries the eggs while the female guards the territory. The male is less active during this period and is often seen close to the surface. The fry remain with the male until they can take care of themselves. Females may catch stray fry and return them to the mouth of the male. The fry are ejected via the gill openings. They are called ulka in Bengali.|$|R

A Complex population had been formed by natural crossing among six cultivars/line expected to carry the nutrient efficiency character; Sukmaraga, Lamuru, Srikandi Kuning, Bisma, Bayu, and Toray and used as a genetic material in this study. The objectives were (i) to evaluate the agronomic performance of complex population in marginal land under limited nutrient supply, (ii) to select the superior entries in each population for nutrient efficiency, and (iii) to identify the characters relate to yield (nutrient efficiency). The selection of nutrient efficiency was based on the ear dry weight produced per plant (yield). The experiment was conducted in marginal land at Agro Techno Park, Indralaya, South Sumatra in January to April 2008. Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications was used. The treatment was number of entries that grouped into six populations based on a female parent. Plants were fertilized with Urea, SP- 36, and KCl at 30 % of standard rate. Sukmaraga population had the best agronomic performance among six populations evaluated. The superior entries selected were top 10 % of the total entries in each population with ear weight more than 150 g. All the characters (ear length and diameter, plant height, leaf chlorophyll, leaf numbers above the ear, and ear leaf area) related to yield (nutrient efficiency) but plant height is the only character measured before anthesis.

We generated a collection of R. tropici CIAT 899 mutants affected in acid tolerance using Tn 5 -luxAB mutagenesis, and one mutant strain (CIAT 899 - 13 T 2), which fails to grow under acid conditions, was characterized in detail. Strain CIAT 899 - 13 T 2 was found to contain a single Tn 5 -luxAB insertion in a gene showing a high degree of similarity with the Escherichia coli gshB gene, encoding the enzyme glutathione synthetase. Intracellular potassium pools and intracellular pH levels were found to be lower in the mutant than in the parent. The glutathione-deficient mutant was shown to be sensitive to weak organic acids, osmotic and oxidative stresses, and the presence of methylglyoxal. Glutathione restores responses to these stresses almost to wild-type levels. Our data show that in R. tropici the production of glutathione is essential for growth in extreme environmental conditions.

In addition, to investigate the molecular basis of acid tolerance, the expression of chaperone genes groEL and dnaKJ was analyzed using acid-tolerant and sensitive mesorhizobia. Tolerance to pH 5 and 9 was evaluated in liquid medium for 98 Portuguese chickpea mesorhizobia belonging to four species clusters. All isolates showed high sensitivity to pH 9. In contrast, mesorhizobia revealed high diversity in terms of tolerance to acid stress: 35 % of the isolates were acid sensitive and 45 % were highly tolerant to pH 5 or moderately acidophilic. An association between mesorhizobia tolerance to acid conditions and the origin soil pH was found. Furthermore, significant differences between species clusters regarding <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> were obtained. Ten isolates were used to investigate the expression levels of the chaperone genes by northern hybridization. Interestingly, most acid-tolerant isolates displayed induction of the dnaK and groESL genes upon acid shock while the sensitive ones showed repression. This study suggests that acid tolerance in mesorhizobia is related to the pH of the origin soil and to the species cluster of the isolates. Additionally, the transcriptional analysis suggests a relationship between induction of major chaperone genes and higher tolerance to acid pH in mesorhizobia.

Hence, an extensification of soybean culture to outer Java suboptimal land areas is needed, such as tidal swamp which occupies approximately 20. 192 million hectares. The main limitations in this soil are soil acidity, Fe toxicity and excess water. To develop soybean varieties tolerant to acid tidal swamp, tolerant soybean gene resources are needed. Hence, glasshouse and field experiments were carried out to identify tolerant gene resources. The glasshouse experiment has been conducted using 185 genotypes of germplasm at the Indonesian Legume and Tuber Crops Research Institute, Malang, East Java. Selection was carried out by using a selection index method. The glasshouse experiment was followed by field experiment at the Belandean research station, Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan, using the best 17 genotypes selected from the glass­house trial. Results showed that there was variability of response of each genotype to acidity and Fe toxicity. Therefore, assessment of soybean <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> and Fe toxicity should be conducted by root growth. Based on selection index criteria, varieties of Lawit and Menyapa served as check tolerant varieties and showed lower growth than the 17 selected genotypes.

40|$|Although lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) {{is grown}} {{in many parts}} of Africa {{relatively}} little investigation has been done on its adaptation to acid soils, which are generally low in available In the present study, lablab was evaluated for <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> and low available P on two Ethiopian soils. The two soils were a Nitosol (Soddo soil) and clay loam with 77 percent Al saturation (Chencha Soil). The PH of the Soddo soil unlimed was 4. 8 and 5. 6 when limed and with 0 and 37. 5 mg/P/kg soil applied at each lime rate. The treatments on the Chencha soil were PH 4. 1 and 5. 9 with combinations 0 and 25 mg/P/kg added. There were highly significant differences between the mean shoot and root dry matter yields and the shoot/root ratios of the lablab accessions on the two soils as well as plant height on the Chencha soil. The mean shoot and root dry matter yields were increased by liming alone by 14 and 23 percent, while P application increased growth by 8 and 12 percent, respectively. Lime and P together suppressed mean root yields. On the Chencha soil, lime increased shoot and root yields by 87 and 35 percent, and by 58 and 14 percent with P added, respectively, while P alone increased growth by 28 and 17 percent with little effect on the limed soil. Labla could be screened for differential performance using mean dry matter yields on both soils but screening for varying levels of acidity and P was reliable only with root yield on the Soddo soil and plant height on the Chencha soil...|$|E

The identification of germoplasm potentially tolerant to acidity was the purpose of this work. Two distinct groups of maize (Zea mays L.) populations were crossed according to the partial diallel mating scheme: Group [1] with six adapted populations and Group [2] with seven exotic varieties. All varieties and crosses were evaluated under the condition of acid and low fertility soil. Traits analyzed were: EY- ear yield, PH- plant height and EH- ear height. Outstanding varieties per se, with yield higher than 3 t ha- 1, were SUWAN- 2, TAITINGA, TAIÚBA and IUBATÃ in Group [1]; and CUPURICO DMR, TUXPEÑO AMARILLO, and AMARILLO DENTADO in Group [2]. Heterosis and its components showed no significant variation for PH and EH; and only average heterosis was significant for EY. The general combining ability effects (g i and g j) showed significant variation (P< 0. 01) for all traits and were due mainly to the variation of variety effects. The higher estimates g i for EY were exhibited by WP 12 (0. 178 t ha- 1), TAIÚBA (0. 176) and TAITINGA (0. 161) in Group [1]; and for g j by CUPURICO DMR (0. 300), TAITINGA TUXPEÑO AMARILLO (0. 280) in Group [2], respectively. The variety cross TAITINGA x TUXPEÑO AMARILLO with mean yield of 4. 34 t ha- 1 and 25 % of mid-parent heterosis may be indicated as an heterotic pattern. PH and EH were not considered as limiting to preclude the use of the outstanding populations.

This paper deals {{with the results of}} the trials from seven locations in two very extreme vegetation seasons (2002 / 03, 2006 / 07). High yield of triticale on the location Banja Luka (150 m alt.) with five triticale varieties in four sowing rates in the replication trial in very unfavorable weather conditions in 2003, points <b>to</b> emphasized triticale <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> high temperatures and drought. High grain yield of triticale in the trials on the locations Banja Luka, Butmir (460 m alt.) and Živince (230 m alt.) was obtained in 2007 too, when all vegetation months had higher mean temperature than long term average, what is a unique appearance in the entire 'meteorological history'.

We have compared {{the influence of}} acidic pH on the activity of CEM- 102 (a steroid-like antibiotic carrying a free carboxyl function) vs. LNZ and CLI against S. aureus. Methods. S. aureus ATCC 25923 was grown in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). MICs were determined in MHB adjusted to pH 7. 4 or pH 5. 5. Doseeffect relationships at 24 h were examined for concentrations from 0. 01 to 100 x the MIC. Results, expressed as {{the change in the}} inoculum at 24 h compared to time 0 h (T 0), were used to fit a Hill equation to allow determination of the values of two key pharmacological descriptors of antibiotic activity (relative potency [EC 50 or 50 % effective concentration] and maximal relative efficacy [Emax]; see Barcia-Macay et al, AAC 50 (3) : 841 - 51).

40|$|Because of its 80 -year {{history of}} heavy {{pollution}} and re-colonization, Lake Orta {{provides a good}} opportunity for investigating the response of zooplankton organisms to heavy metals and acidification {{as well as the}} mechanisms involved. After the recent establishment of Daphnia galeata Sars, and the detection of an extremely low clonal diversity of Lake Orta population, we carried out a study to investigate the lethal <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> ionic copper, as well as <b>to</b> <b>acidity,</b> and the impact of newborn Daphnia exposure to sublethal concentrations of copper for their later development and reproduction. We conducted acute toxicity tests to estimate the EC 50 for ionic copper and <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> low pH, as well as life table experiments. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>to</b> ionic copper was high, three times that reported in literature. An increased mortality soon after exposure to low pH confirmed a high sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> and explained the success of the species in Lake Orta only after pH recovery. An analysis of reproductive and demographic parameters revealed that D. galeata Sars was stressed at concentrations of ionic copper only twice higher than those presently recorded in the lake (i. e., ca 3 ?g L- 1). An increased cumulative number of eggs produced by each female were in fact counterbalanced by an increasing abortion rate, which resulted in an unaltered or lower intrinsic rate of population increase. Our results are likely due to the strong selective pressure, more than physiological processes (acclimation), in a polluted area in which only specific adapted clones are able to grow, confirming the results previously obtained on Lake Orta 2 ̆ 7 s D. obtusa Kurz population. The reproductive response and the relatively low within treatment variability suggest that clone specificity, rather than physiological acclimation, was the driving force. The low variability confirmed results previously obtained from life tables experiments on Lake Orta 2 ̆ 7 s D. obtusa clone. Overall, our results suggest that, despite the chemical recovery, Lake Orta may be regarded as highly vulnerable to biodiversity loss...|$|R

Grafting vegetable elite cultivars onto appropriate rootstocks may represent an effective tool to improve crop <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> and Al toxicity. Two greenhouse hydroponic experiments were performed to evaluate growth, yield, biomass production, chlorophyll index, electrolyte leakage, mineral composition and assimilate partitioning in plant tissues of cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L. ‘Ekron’) either non-grafted or grafted onto ‘P 360 ’ (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne × Cucurbita moschata Duchesne; E/C) or figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia Bouché; E/F). Cucumber plants were cultured in pots and supplied with nutrient solutions having different pH and Al concentrations: pH 6, pH 3. 5, pH 3. 5 + 1. 5 mM Al and pH 3. 5 + 3 mM Al (Exp. 1, 14 d) and pH 6, pH 3. 5 and pH 3. 5 + 0. 75 mM Al (Exp. 2, 67 d). Significant depression in shoot and root biomass was observed in response to acidity and Al concentrations, with Al-stress being more phytotoxic than low pH treatment. Significant decrease in yield, shoot and root biomass, leaf area, SPAD index, N, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, and B concentration in aerial parts (leaves and stems) in response to low pH with more detrimental effects at pH 3. 5 + Al. Grafted E/C plants grown under low pH and Al had higher yield, shoot and root biomass compared to E/F and non-grafted plants. This better crop performance of E/C plants in response to Al stress was related to i) a reduced translocation of Al from roots to the shoot, ii) a better shoot and root nutritional status in K, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn concentration, iii) a higher chlorophyll synthesis, as well as iv) the ability to maintain cell membrane stability and integrity (lower electrolyte leakage).

Productivity of Sesbania as animal feed is widely limited by soil acidity and low In this study, eighteen ILCA accessions of S. sesban and two of S. goetzei, all but two from Africa, were evaluated for <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> and low P on two Ethiopian soils as well as their tolerance to Al and response to P in nutrient solutions. The treatments were O and 4000 mg CaCO 3 /kg (PH 4. 8 and 5. 6) in combination with O and 37. 5 mg P/kg on a Soddo Nitosol. On the chencha clay loam with 77 percent Al saturation, the PH values were 4. 1 (unlimed) and 5. 9 (limed) in combination with 0 and 25 mg P/kg on the unlimed soil plus 37. 5 mg/P/kg on the limed soil. Treatments applied to the nutrient solutions were 0, 3, and 6 ppm Al in combination with 155 and 6200 PPm P as KH 2 p 04. On the Soddo soil, Sesbania responded primarily to P which increased average shoot growth by 171 to 822 percent with low response (6. 5 percent) to lime which did not significantly differ among the accessions. On the chencha soil, the Sesbania were highly responsive to lime and P which increased shoot growth by 129 to 425 percent, and 100 to 492 percent respectively. The Sesbania varied in their tolerance to Al which gave shoot yield reductions of 18 to 69 percent with 3 PPm and 33 to 84 percent with 6 PPm Al at low Increasing P level to 6200 PPm greatly alleviated the deleterious effects of Al {{to such an extent that}} only one accession had growth reduction greater than 50 percent at 3 PPm Al.

A frequently reported problem is {{the failure of the}} inoculant strains to overcome the competition imposed by indigenous rhizobial populations. The screening of indigenous rhizobia, already adapted to local conditions, searching for highly effective strains for use as inoculants represents a promising strategy in overcoming inoculation failure. The objective {{of this study was to}} isolate and characterize indigenous rhizobia and to identify strains that hold potential to be included in inoculant formulations for soybean production, with both promiscuous and non-promiscuous soybean cultivars, in Mozambican agro-climatic conditions. A total of 105 isolates obtained from nodules of promiscuous soybean grown at 15 sites were screened for N 2 -fixation effectiveness in the greenhouse along with five commercial strains. Eighty-seven isolates confirmed the ability to form effective nodules on soybean and were used for genetic characterization by rep-PCR (BOX) and sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, and also for symbiotic effectiveness. BOX-PCR fingerprinting revealed remarkable genetic diversity, with 41 clusters formed, considering a similarity level of 65 %. The 16 S rRNA analysis assigned the isolates to the genera Bradyrhizobium (75 %) and Agrobacterium/Rhizobium (25 %). Great variability in symbiotic effectiveness was detected among the indigenous rhizobia from Mozambique, with ten isolates performing better than the commercial strain B. diazoefficiens USDA 110, the best reference strain, and 51 isolates with lower performance than all reference strains. Thirteen of the best isolates from the first greenhouse trial were evaluated, along with the five commercial strains, in two promiscuous (TGx 1963 - 3 F and TGx 1835 - 10 E) and one non-promiscuous (BRS 284) soybean cultivars in a second greenhouse trial. In general the promiscous soybeans responded better to inoculation. The 13 isolates were also characterized for <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> and alkalinity (pH 3. 5 and 9. 0, respectively), salinity (0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 mol L− 1 of NaCl) and high temperatures (35, 40 and 45 °C) in vitro. Five isolates, three (Moz 4, Moz 19 and Moz 22) belonging to the superclade B. elkanii and two (Moz 27 and Moz 61) assigned to the superclade B. japonicum, consistently showed high symbiotic effectiveness, suggesting that the inoculation with indigenous rhizobia adapted to local conditions represents a possible strategy for increasing soybean yields in Mozambique.

40|$|Pasture plants already {{adapted to}} acidic soil {{conditions}} are required {{as part of}} an integrated approach (with lime amelioration) to managing acid soils on the Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the usefulness of Austrodanthonia species for this purpose. The material evaluated in this study was collected during a previous survey of the distribution of Austrodanthonia on the Central, Southern and Monaro Tablelands of New South Wales. It was hypothesised that the genus Austrodanthonia has a wide range of <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> acid soils. A series of experiments that provided information on the growth and physiology of Austrodanthonia in relation <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity,</b> with a view to the identification and eventual domestication of the most promising plant material have been conducted through pot, hydroponics and field investigations. Firstly, soils were acidified or limed to obtain a range of soil pH and Al concentrations. This experiment showed that adding aluminium sulfate and calcium carbonate followed by washing excess salts with water is a simple, rapid and convenient method for adjusting soil pH for pot experiments. The pH of the amended soils remained relatively unchanged eight months after treatment. The experimental set-up also resulted {{in a wide range of}} soluble Al (2 - 52 mg/kg) across the soils. The relative Al-tolerance of 183 accessions from 15 Austrodanthonia species was tested in a pot experiment using a range of soil pH. Emergence, survival and growth of all accessions were drastically reduced by high soil acidity (pH 3. 9, P < 0. 001). About 11 % of plants emerged at pH 3. 9, whereas at pH 4. 4 and 5. 3, ~ 72 % of plants emerged. Accessions exhibited large variation within and between species in their <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity.</b> From the species/accessions tested, 49 accessions from eight species were selected for further study (on the basis of being more acid tolerant). Hydroponic experiments conducted in the glasshouse evaluated: (i) formulation of nutrient solution with a stable pH, (ii) effectiveness of the formulation using tap water and deionised water and (iii) estimation of free ion activities of Al and Mn in the nutrient solution and their effects on Austrodanthonia growth. These experiments showed that a NO 3 -N/NH 4 -N ratio of 9 : 4 is the most appropriate ratio to obtain a stable pH 4. 0 without affecting plant growth; that there was little difference between tap water and deionised water on the ionic effects of Al and Mn, and plant-size did not play a role on accession survival and that accessions of Austrodanthonia could grow well within a wide range of pH (3. 5 - 5. 5), Al (50 - 250 �M) and Mn (100 - 2000 �M). Growth of Austrodanthonia accessions declined under high acidity (pH < 3. 5) and Al (300 �M), but tolerated high concentrations of Mn (2000 �M). Root-tips stained with hematoxylin grouped accessions in a similar way to the pot and hydroponic experiments for most of the accessions tested. The intensity of root staining with hematoxylin and the differential distribution of Al in the shoots and roots provided an indication that different tolerance mechanisms may be involved with Austrodanthonia accessions. It appears that both exclusion and internal mechanisms may operate for Al- and Mn-tolerance. A field experiment was conducted at Carcoar (33037 �S, 149013 �E, elevation 800 m) using gradients in soil pH and Al available on-site to grow selected accessions of Austrodanthonia. The accessions exhibited a range of responses <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity.</b> The accession responses <b>to</b> <b>acidity</b> from the pot and hydroponic experiments were similar to those obtained in the field, especially where Al was present as a low Al-challenge. Overall, this study shows that Austrodanthonia exhibits a wide range of acid tolerance between species and accessions within species. Among the species tested, A. duttoniana and A. fulva appeared to have the greatest commercial potential, because of their productivity and acid tolerance. The variability that exists in the accessions may be exploitable in breeding and selection programs for improved cultivars...|$|R

Os experimentos foram instalados de 1987 a 1995 em um cambissolo ácido e de baixa fertilidade, sem irrigação e após pousio ou soja. O delineamento foi de blocos, em parcela subsubdividida, com quatro repetições. A parcela constou de três doses de calcário (0, 6, 5 e 13 t ha- 1); a subparcela, de três doses de P (0, 30 e 90 kg ha- 1 de P 2 O 5), e as subsubparcelas, de quatro genótipos (IAC- 5, IAC- 24, IAC- 60 e Anahuac). O calcário foi aplicado no primeiro ano (1987) e reaplicado em 1991, e o P, anualmente, no sulco de semeadura. Os genótipos de trigo tolerantes à acidez (IAC- 5 e IAC- 60) se mostraram mais responsivos à calagem e à aplicação de P e, mesmo em solos parcialmente corrigidos, apresentaram maiores rendimentos de grãos do que o {{material}} sensível à acidez (Anahuac). A correção da acidez e a adubação fosfatada provocaram a diminuição da relação palha:grão por favorecer mais a produção de grãos do que o desenvolvimento vegetativo. Essa relação foi menor e mais constante no genótipo IAC- 60, tolerante à acidez. Os genótipos IAC- 5 e IAC- 60 mostraram-se mais eficientes em relação ao aproveitamento do P aplicado para o rendimento de grãos em solos de baixa fertilidade. Field {{experiments were}} set up during nine years, in a low fertility, very acid Cambisol, {{with the objective of}} evaluating the response to lime and phosphorus of four wheat genotypes differing in <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity.</b> The experiments were carried out without irrigation, in randomized blocks with a split-split plot design, with four replications. The plots contained the three rates of limestone (0, 6. 5, and 13 ton ha- 1); the split-plots the rates of phosphorus (0, 30, and 90 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5), and the split-split plots the wheat varieties (IAC- 5, IAC- 24, IAC- 60 and Anahuac). Lime was applied in the first year (1987) and reapplied in 1991; phosphorus was applied yearly. Wheat varieties tolerant <b>to</b> soil <b>acidity</b> (IAC- 5 and IAC- 60) were more responsive to limestone and phosphorus application and, even in soils with acidity partially neutralized, showed higher grain yields than the acid sensitive variety (Anahuac). Limestone and phosphorus caused a decrease in the straw:grain ratio because they increased the grain yield more than the vegetative growth. This ratio was lower and more stable with IAC- 60. Genotypes IAC- 5 and IAC- 60 were the most efficient to use the applied phosphorus to produce grain. Yields of grain and straw, and plant size were usually more affected by phosphorus than by limestone application...|$|R
