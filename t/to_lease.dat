5|$|On 4 December, Stabæk Fotball {{stated that}} {{they were willing to}} move their training, Norwegian Football Cup and UEFA matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal, as a {{compromise}} to free up more available time in the arena. This was rejected by NFF, who stated that the licensing rules required that a club's main arena be available for all league, cup and UEFA matches, and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup. In mid-December, Stabæk Fotball started the process of a judicial registration of the right <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the venue, which was permitted according to the contract. This would grant Stabæk Fotball the right to continue <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt.

5|$|The 1866 Act {{also gave}} the Anglesey Central Railway (ACR) {{the right to}} {{authorise}} Dickson <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> or work the line, or <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> or sell the line to the LNWR.

The act authorised a branch from Rhosgoch to Cemaes, {{but this was not}} built. The Fairlie engine Mountaineer was in use on the line in April 1866, but by October 1867 it was in use on the Neath and Brecon Railway, of which Dickson was also the contractor and whose traffic he was working.

5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment.

Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|E

In March 1960, news broke that the highway department was about <b>to</b> <b>lease</b> 34 used dump trucks {{at a very}} favorable price from Louisville Ford dealer Thurston Cooke, who had served as finance chairman for Combs' gubernatorial campaign. Some charged that this amounted to a political payoff by Clements. Combs, already under fire for appointing Clements, canceled the lease bid on April 19. Clements was offended by this action and considered it a public rebuke. The incident caused a rift between Combs and Clements that never fully healed, although Clements did not resign immediately.|$|E
