Composed of sharp geometric shapes, her head is the most strictly Cubist of all five. The curtain seems to blend partially into her body. The Cubist head of the crouching figure (lower right) underwent at least two revisions from an Iberian figure to its current state. She also {{seems to have been}} drawn from two different perspectives at once, creating a confusing, twisted figure.

The overtaking manoeuvre was hearlded by the worldwide press and many people involved in Formula One as [...] "the best ever manoeuvre in grand prix racing". Michael Schumacher remained confident about his title chances: [...] "With only six points between Mika and I and four more races to go, I am still optimistic about our chances.

500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>picture.</b> My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{weeks in}} advance of the filming, the real Henry Hill was paid $480,000. The film was shot on {{location}} in Queens, New York, New Jersey, and parts of Long Island during {{the spring and summer of}} 1989, with a budget of $25 million. Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and storyboarded everything because of the complicated style throughout. According to the filmmaker, he [...] "wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>picture,</b> and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [...] last day as a wiseguy, it's as if <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>picture</b> would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out." [...] He claims that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of Jules and Jim (1962): extensive narration, quick edits, freeze frames, and multiple locale switches. It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, [...] "So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?—That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show". He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information. He also put plenty of detail in every frame because the gangster life is so rich. The use of freeze frames was done because Scorsese wanted images that would stop [...] "because a point was being reached" [...] in Henry's life.|$|E

In that sense, Harrison continues, the satyr plays precipitated a [...] "spirit of celebration" [...] into the dramatic festival which also caused a [...] "release into the worship of Dionysus". According to the same book, with his Trackers, Harrison wants to criticise the tendency of the elitists and right-wing politicians to divide art and society along refined and popular lines, represented by separate Apollonian and Dionysiac camps.|$|E

The team performance framework (TPF) and the results from its application are presented in the practical part. The TPF includes different factors influencing team performance, such as input factors, motivation, communication, and output factors.
