His men constructed breastworks and rifle pits that extended 2.5 miles from the Mummasburg Road to the Emmitsburg Road. He decided to send his long train of wagons carrying equipment and supplies, which had been captured in great quantities throughout the campaign, to the rear as quickly as possible, in advance of the infantry. The wagon train included ambulances with his 8,000 wounded men who were fit to travel, {{as well as some of}} the key general officers who were severely wounded, but <b>too</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoned.

Considered {{to be on the}} right wing of the political spectrum, he was a member of the Reform Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance before winning election himself. He first ran for Brantford City Council in the 1997 municipal election; thirty-one years old during the campaign, he finished a relatively close third. He was elected in his second attempt in 2000; in this campaign, he called for Brantford casino revenues to be put in a reserve to reduce taxes and opposed using public funds to save private buildings. After the election, he emerged as a frequent opponent of Mayor Chris Friel and a regular ally of his ward-mate Richard Carpenter. In 2002, he offered support to Marguerite Ceschi-Smith's campaign for reclaiming brownfield sites. Wrobel supported Progressive Conservative candidate Alayne Sokoloski in the 2003 provincial election. He was himself re-elected in the 2003 municipal election. Wrobel was given a leave of absence for health reasons in early 2005. He joined with Carpenter and Ceschi-Smith in November 2005, refusing to attend a closed-door session on boundary adjustments and ethanol production; he said the issues were <b>too</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dealt with in private. He resigned his seat in February 2006 following continued health issues. With his health situation improved, he was re-elected to council in 2010.|$|E

[...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems that way because it's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are <b>too</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time".

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of Kurt Cobain as a playable {{character in the}} game has been considered a [...] "strange concept" [...] by some reviewers, reflecting on the possible influence of commercialization pressures that played into Cobain's suicide. Shortly after the game's release, {{it was discovered that}} once players unlocked the Kurt Cobain Character Pack (as well as that for any other of the included famous musicians), they could use that character for any other song on disc, leading to what some have considered to be awkward virtual performances of Cobain singing songs from completely different genres; user-created videos of these performances that had attracted the attention to this issue have since been removed from video-sharing sites like YouTube by Activision. Previous games in the series that feature known musicians also allow for the use of their characters, once unlocked, in other songs, except for the case of Jimi Hendrix in Guitar Hero World Tour, the only posthumous artist to appear in the series prior to Guitar Hero 5. Some have seen this as a scar on Cobain's legacy; Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb commented that [...] "it's the near-mythic legacy he left behind and the way the Nirvana catalog has been protected from commercial interests over the years that makes this stuff so harsh" [...] on his observation of such performances. Tim Walker of The Independent contrasted Cobain's [...] "posthumous humiliation" [...] to the appearance of virtual characters based on living artists that have appeared in rhythm music games, noting that deceased artists {{do not have the same}} fair consideration as live artists that can opt to license their images for such rhythm games. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times countered these arguments, noting that as long as no legal contracts were broken, Cobain and the other artists in the game [...] "are too big and <b>too</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> damaged in a cultural sense by mere inclusion in a video game".|$|E

2500|$|Law and Society is an American movement, {{which was}} {{established}} after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had {{a vested interest in}} the study of law.

Its founders believed that the [...] "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods". The establishment of the Law and Society Association in 1964 and of the Law and Society Review in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.|$|E

2500|$|In 1932, a Qur'an in the Turkish {{language}} was read before a live audience and broadcast over the radio. That same year, Mustafa Kemal wanted to [...] "teach religion in Turkish to Turkish {{people who had}} been practising Islam without understanding it for centuries" [...] All Qur'ans in Turkey at the time were printed in Old Arabic. There was a rare polyglot Qu'ran written in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Latin in the tetrapla style, prepared by savant Andrea Acolutho of Bernstadt and printed at Berlin in 1701. In 1924, three Turkish translations published in Istanbul created controversy. Several renderings of the Qur'an in the Turkish language were read in front of the public. These Turkish Qur'ans were fiercely opposed by religious people. This incident impelled many leading Muslim modernists to call upon the Turkish Parliament to sponsor a Qur'an translation of suitable quality. With the support of Mustafa Kemal, the Parliament approved the project and the Directorate of Religious Affairs appointed Mehmet Akif (Ersoy) to compose a Qur'an translation, and an Islamic scholar [...] to author a Turkish language Qur'anic commentary (tafsir) titled [...] "." [...] It was only in 1935 that the version read in public found its way to print. Mustafa Kemal believed that the understanding of religion was <b>too</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left to a small group of people. This included the central religious text of Islam. Mustafa Kemal's objective was to make the Qu'ran accessible to modern people, and therefore to translate it into modern languages.|$|E
