40|$|OBJECTIVE: There are few data {{available}} about factors which influence physicians' decisions to discharge patients from <b>their</b> <b>practices.</b> To study general internists' and family medicine physicians' attitudes and experiences in discharging patients from <b>their</b> <b>practices.</b> DESIGN: A cross-sectional mailed survey was used. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand general internists and family medicine physicians {{participated in this}} study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied the likelihood physicians would discharge 12 hypothetical patients from <b>their</b> <b>practices,</b> and whether they had actually discharged such patients. The effect of demographic data {{on the number of}} scenarios in which patients were likely to be discharged, and the number of patients actually discharged were analyzed via ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analysis. Of 977 surveys received by subjects, 526 (54 %) were completed and returned. A majority of respondents were willing to discharge patients in 5 of 12 hypothetical scenarios. Eighty-five percent had actually discharged at least one patient from <b>their</b> <b>practices.</b> Most respondents (71 %) had discharged 10 or fewer patients, but 14 % had discharged 11 to 200 patients. Respondents who were in private practice (p= 48 years old) were more likely to discharge actual patients from <b>their</b> <b>practices</b> (p= 0. 005) as were physicians practicing in rural settings (p= 0. 003). CONCLUSIONS: Most physicians in our sample were willing to discharge actual and hypothetical patients from <b>their</b> <b>practices.</b> This tendency may have significant implications for the initiation of pay-for-performance programs. Physicians should be educated {{about the importance of the}} patient-physician relationship and their fiduciary obligations to the patient...|$|R

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. <b>Their</b> <b>practice</b> parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in <b>their</b> <b>practice,</b> most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT.

5|$|At their nominating {{convention}} in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat Simon B.

In his acceptance speech, Bradley implored Kentuckians {{to realize that}} the Civil War was over and to discontinue <b>their</b> <b>practice</b> of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office. His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high protective tariff, and developing the state's resources. He pointed out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than Pennsylvania, the state bought half of its coal from that state. A similar situation existed with regard to lumber. He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations. Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and {{the construction of a new}} state penitentiary. Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.|$|E

We investigated twenty farmers in Burgundy in order to describe how the interactive dialogues in their social network influenced the way they brought about changes in the forage domain. Three positions were identified: a practical position (what farmers say on <b>their</b> <b>practices</b> in relation to the others), a social position (the position in the social network made of all the farmers being interviewed) and a geographical position (the physical position in a geographical space). Coherence appeared between these three positions and showed that the way farmers choose and analyse <b>their</b> <b>practices,</b> in the forage domain, could be explained geographically and socially. This was particularly true when we looked at the use of wrapping; we noticed the role of some farmers is determined by their position in the social network...|$|R
