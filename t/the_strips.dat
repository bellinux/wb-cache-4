5|$|Mézières et Christin avec... (1983) – {{compilation}} of early work, {{including the first}} publication of the Valérian story Bad Dreams in an album as well as Mon Amérique à moi and <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> Mézières produced for Métal Hurlant.|$|E
5|$|The strip {{concentrates}} on character interaction, but sometimes veers into commentary based on Simpson's political views. Most of <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> have been reprinted in book form. Five collections were released through Plan 9 Publishing, {{but they have}} all gone out of print.|$|E
5000|$|Center buckle - The {{center of}} <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> is [...] "wavy" [...] due to <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in <b>the</b> center being longer than <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> at <b>the</b> edges.|$|R
50|$|Fisher {{appeared}} {{to lose all}} interest in <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> during <b>the</b> 1930s, and after Mack died in 1932, the job of creating <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> fell to Al Smith. <b>The</b> <b>strip</b> retained Fisher's signature until his death, however, and not until December 7, 1954, was <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> signed by Smith.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strip</b> has {{continued}} {{to the present day}} by different writers and artists. Mark Lasky briefly handled <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in 1983 until his death from cancer at age 29. <b>The</b> <b>strip</b> was handed to Jerry Scott in 1984, who drew <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in a much different, more modern style than other incarnations. In 1994, the syndicate began seeking a replacement for Scott; one applicant was Ivan Brunetti. In 1995, Guy and Brad Gilchrist were given control of <b>the</b> <b>strip,</b> returning <b>the</b> artwork to its traditional forms; Brad Gilchrist subsequently left <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> entirely to Guy.|$|R
5|$|Two of {{the short}} stories were adapted for {{publication}} in comic strip format, which were published daily in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide. The Living Daylights ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak; the same pair also worked on Octopussy, which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967. The story lines for <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> were altered from the original Fleming version {{to ensure that they}} contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action. <b>The</b> <b>strips</b> were reprinted by Titan Books in 1988 and then again in The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2, published in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ma {{recovered}} {{more than}} 1,200 Warring States period bamboo slips from the Kingdom of Chu, {{now known as}} the Shanghai Museum bamboo slips. Several ancient texts were written on <b>the</b> <b>strips,</b> including the Kongzi Shi Lun, a previously unknown commentary on the Confucian Classic of Poetry attributed to Confucius himself. The discovery caused a sensation in academia, and the texts {{have been the subject of}} intense studies by numerous scholars, including Ma himself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{monorail}} generally runs behind <b>the</b> eastern <b>Strip</b> side {{hotels and}} casinos, a long {{block away from}} <b>the</b> <b>Strip.</b> Usually, it requires a walk through a casino to get to <b>the</b> <b>Strip,</b> emerging upon <b>the</b> <b>Strip</b> {{in front of the}} property. [...] This lack of a direct presence on <b>the</b> <b>Strip</b> along with ticket prices has been a factor in the rather slow acceptance of the monorail.|$|R
40|$|A {{vibrating}} gyroscope {{includes a}} piezoelectric strip having length and width dimensions. <b>The</b> piezoelectric <b>strip</b> includes a piezoelectric material and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) substantially aligned and polled along <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> length dimension. A spindle having an {{axis of rotation}} is coupled to <b>the</b> piezoelectric <b>strip.</b> <b>The</b> axis of rotation is parallel to <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> width dimension.

25|$|The {{series has}} a loose {{connection}} with the continuity of <b>the</b> comic <b>strip,</b> though during <b>the</b> final year of <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> McGruder made a point to try to synchronize both. He introduced Uncle Ruckus into <b>the</b> <b>strip,</b> and <b>the</b> comic-strip version of Riley's hair was braided into cornrows to match the character's design in the series. During Season 1, McGruder put <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> on a 6-month hiatus beginning in March 2006. He {{did not return to}} <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> <b>the</b> following November, and <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate, announced that it had been cancelled.|$|R
5|$|Purcell joined LucasArts in 1988 as {{an artist}} and game designer, where he was {{approached}} about contributing to LucasArts' new quarterly newsletter, The Adventurer, a publication designed to inform customers about upcoming LucasArts games and company news. From its debut issue in 1990 to 1996, Purcell created twelve comic strips for the newsletter. <b>The</b> <b>strips</b> portrayed a variety of stories, from similar plots as in the comic books to parodies of LucasArts games such as Monkey Island and Full Throttle and the Lucasfilm franchises Star Wars and Indiana Jones.|$|E
5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E
5|$|Raymond's father {{encouraged}} {{his love}} of drawing from an early age, leading him to become an assistant illustrator in the early 1930s on strips such as Tillie the Toiler and Tim Tyler's Luck. Towards the end of 1933, Raymond created the epic Flash Gordon science-fiction comic strip {{to compete with the}} popular Buck Rogers comic strip and, before long, Flash was the more popular strip of the two. Raymond also worked on the jungle adventure saga Jungle Jim and spy adventure Secret Agent X-9 concurrently with Flash, though his increasing workload caused him to leave Secret Agent X-9 to another artist by 1935. He left <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> in 1944 to join the Marines, saw combat in the Pacific Ocean theater in 1945 and was demobilized in 1946. Upon his return from serving during World War II, Raymond created and illustrated the much-heralded Rip Kirby, a private detective comic strip. In 1956, Raymond was killed in a car crash at the age of 46; he was survived by his wife and five children.|$|E
5000|$|During {{contract}} negotiations, the syndicate approached Meddick with {{a request}} to {{change the name of}} <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> to Monty and to deemphasize and remove the Robotman character from <b>the</b> <b>strip.</b> This was due to an ongoing difficulty in marketing <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> with <b>the</b> name Robotman (for a brief period, <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> was rechristened [...] "Robotman & Monty").|$|R
5000|$|When Scott Adams, {{creator of}} Dilbert and {{supporter}} of <b>the</b> <b>strip,</b> told his fans about [...] "Pearls Before Swine", interest skyrocketed, and <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> {{was taken to}} print. Aiding Pastis in the artistic elements of <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> was Darby Conley, creator of <b>the</b> comic <b>strip</b> Get Fuzzy.|$|R
50|$|McBride's {{assistant}} on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> was former Disney artist Roger Armstrong (1917-2007). After McBride's 1951 {{death in}} Altadena, California, his second wife, Margot Fischer McBride, wrote <b>the</b> <b>strip,</b> and she hired Armstrong as the illustrator. In 1952, the team {{switched to the}} Mirror Enterprises Syndicate in Los Angeles, keeping <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> going for <b>the</b> next eight years. Joseph Messerli drew <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> from 1953 to 1956. Another artist who worked on Napoleon was Ed Nofziger. <b>The</b> <b>strip</b> ended in 1961.|$|R
5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. <b>The</b> <b>strips</b> of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road was {{developed}} by a small team at LucasArts, {{many of whom had}} previous experience working on other LucasArts adventure games. The game was designed by Sean Clark, Michael Stemmle, Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell and his future wife Collette Michaud, all of whom had worked on Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. Sam and Max first appeared as video game characters as internal testing material for SCUMM engine programmers recently employed by LucasArts; Steve Purcell created animated versions of the characters and an office backdrop for the programmers to practice on. Soon after, Sam & Max comic strips by Steve Purcell were published in LucasArts' quarterly newsletter. After a positive reaction from fans to <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> and out of a wish to use new characters and settings after the success of the Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion franchises, LucasArts offered in 1992 to create a video game out of the characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{settings}} within Tintin {{have also}} added depth to <b>the</b> <b>strips.</b> Hergé mingles real and fictional lands into his stories, {{along with a}} base in Belgium from where Tintin sets off—originally 26 Labrador Road, but later Marlinspike Hall. The role of setting is aptly demonstrated in King Ottokar's Sceptre, in which Hergé creates two fictional countries, Syldavia and Borduria, and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline. Other fictional lands include Khemed on the Arabian Peninsula and San Theodoros, São Rico, and Nuevo Rico in South America, {{as well as the}} kingdom of Gaipajama in India. Along with these fictitious locations, actual nations were employed such as Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Indonesia, Nepal, Tibet, and China. Other actual locales used were the Sahara, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Moon.|$|E
50|$|Amy (sometimes called Our Girl Amy) is {{the title}} of a comic strip about a girl created by Harry Mace in 1962. Mace was later joined on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> by Jack Tippit, but Mace left <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in 1965. Tippit {{continued}} alone on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> until <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> ended in 1991. Tippit received the National Cartoonists Society Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> for 1970. It was syndicated by the Register and Tribune Syndicate, now part of King Features Syndicate.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strip</b> {{is drawn}} in detail and appears in color. While <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> is usually stand alone, on many {{occasions}} it is serialized with the story running {{for a week or}} more on some occasions. <b>The</b> daily <b>strip</b> usually runs to four panels. <b>The</b> Sunday <b>strip</b> is in a three-by-three panel format with <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> logo appearing in the top left panel.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> Etest <b>strip</b> {{is placed}} on an agar surface, the {{antibiotic}} gradient on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> is simply transferred to the agar matrix creating an imprint of the gradient on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in <b>the</b> agar. The bacterial growth becomes visible after incubation and a symmetrical inhibition ellipse centered along <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> is seen. <b>The</b> MIC value is read from the scale in terms of µg/mL where the ellipse edge intersects <b>the</b> <b>strip.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>strips</b> {{scheduled}} {{to run from}} October 31 to November 5, 2005, and a Sunday strip scheduled for November 13 about the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court were withdrawn suddenly after her nomination was withdrawn. <b>The</b> <b>strips</b> have been posted on the official website, and were replaced by re-runs by the syndicate.|$|E
25|$|In June 1989, several days' comics (which {{had already}} been drawn and written) had to be {{replaced}} with repeats, because the humor of <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> was considered in bad taste {{in light of the}} violent crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Trudeau himself asked for the recall, despite an interview published with Universal Press Syndicate Editorial Director Lee Salem in the May 28, 1989, San Jose Mercury News, in which Salem stated his hopes <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> could still be used.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>strip</b> {{is perhaps}} best known for the fact that, unlike most comic strips, it took place more or less in real time for most of its run. Michael and Elizabeth were a young child and a toddler at <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> beginning, and by the end had grown into adults, with Michael married and raising his own {{children}} while Elizabeth married at the end of <b>the</b> <b>strip.</b> Youngest child April was born 11 years into <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> run and was roughly 16 at <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> conclusion.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1997, The Gateway {{refused to}} publish <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> [...] "Clobberin' Time." [...] <b>The</b> <b>strip</b> was {{nevertheless}} {{available on the}} cartoonist's web site, which was hosted on university servers, and The Gateway mentioned the URL which led to <b>the</b> comic <b>strip.</b> <b>The</b> <b>strip's</b> presence ignited a controversy across many campuses.|$|R
50|$|When Conselman {{died in the}} mid-1940s, {{his estate}} took over <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> and {{employed}} several writers, while Plumb received sole credit on <b>the</b> <b>strip.</b> Fred Fox took over as <b>the</b> <b>strip's</b> artist in <b>the</b> mid-1950s, followed by Roger Armstrong.|$|R
25|$|A {{comic strip}} by Guy Gilchrist and Brad Gilchrist {{circulated}} in newspapers during the 1980s. Many of <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> were compiled in various book collections.|$|E

25|$|While {{the online}} version of The Order of the Stick unfolds continuously, <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> {{have been broken}} down into plot arcs for {{purposes}} of publication; the plot summary that follows breaks the story down into these arcs for clarity. Burlew notes in the commentary of War and XPs that <b>the</b> <b>strips</b> contained within that volume {{were the first to}} be plotted with publication in mind from the very beginning. Several volumes have been released in book-only format: On the Origin of PCs, a prequel to the heroes' adventures; Start of Darkness, a prequel to the villains' escapades; and Snips, Snails and Dragon Tails, a collection of all the Dragon Magazine comics plus 80 pages of new material.|$|E
50|$|As for {{the stories}} in <b>the</b> Superman <b>strips,</b> Jerry Siegel {{originally}} wrote them until he was drafted in 1943. Whitney Ellsworth, who had begun on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in 1941, continued until 1945. Jack Schiff began his writing on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> in 1942 and worked on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> off and on until 1962.|$|R
5000|$|Graff was {{followed}} by artist Bob Lubbers, who used the pseudonym [...] "Bob Lewis" [...] and drew <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> from 1960 through 1966. From 1967 to 1980, <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> was written by Archie Goodwin and drawn by Al Williamson, who together also collaborated on the Star Wars comic <b>strip.</b> <b>The</b> last artist on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> was veteran George Evans, who wrote and drew <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> from 1980 to his retirement in 1996.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Strip {{shape is}} an {{important}} factor affecting <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> quality significantly during cold rolling of thin <b>strip.</b> In <b>the</b> paper, finite element simulation models of <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> shape in cold rolling for both symmetrical and asymmetrical rolling cases were successfully developed. <b>The</b> <b>strip</b> edge drop and the effect of the rolling force on <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> shape (<b>the</b> thickness distribution along <b>the</b> <b>strip</b> width) have been obtained. The developed finite element model has been verified with the experimental value, which shows they are in good agreement. The obtained results are applicable to control <b>the</b> rolled thin <b>strip</b> shape during cold rolling practice...|$|R
