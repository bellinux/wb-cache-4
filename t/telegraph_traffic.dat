As telegraphs became more complex, the need for a constant voltage became critical and the Grove device was limited (as the cell discharged, nitric acid was depleted and voltage was reduced). By the time of the American Civil War, Grove's battery had been replaced by the Daniell battery. In 1841 Robert Bunsen replaced the expensive platinum electrode used in Grove's battery with a carbon electrode.

2500|$|In 1874, <b>telegraph</b> message <b>traffic</b> {{was rapidly}} {{expanding}} {{and in the}} words of Western Union President William Orton, had become [...] "the nervous system of commerce". Orton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray {{to find a way to}} send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines. When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's patent attorney, Anthony Pollok.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{before the}} war, British and Japanese {{intelligence}} had co-operated against Russia {{due to the}} Anglo–Japanese Alliance. During the war, Indian Army stations in Malaya and China often intercepted and read wireless and <b>telegraph</b> cable <b>traffic</b> relating to the war, which was shared with the Japanese. In their turn, the Japanese shared information about Russia with the British with one British official writing of the [...] "perfect quality" [...] of Japanese intelligence. In particular, British and Japanese intelligence gathered much evidence that Germany was supporting Russia in the war {{as part of a}} bid to disturb {{the balance of power in}} Europe, which led to British officials increasingly perceiving that country as a threat to the international order.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} method to extract multiple objects from mobile laser scanning data. The proposed method firstly generates multi-scale supervoxels from 3 D point clouds using colors, intensities and spatial distances. Then, a graph-based segmentation method {{is applied to}} segment the supervoxels by integrating their colors, intensities, normal vectors, and principal directions. Then, the saliency of each segment is calculated and the most salient segment is selected as a seed to cluster for objects clustering. Hence, the objects are classified and the constraint conditions of object's category are included to re-clustering for more accurate extraction of objects. Experiments show that the proposed method has a promising solution for extracting buildings, ground, street lamps, trees, <b>telegraph</b> poles, <b>traffic</b> signs, cars, enclosures and the objects extraction overall accuracy is 92. 3 %...|$|R

5000|$|CNCP Telecommunications (Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Telecommunications) was an {{electrical}} telegraph operator {{and later as}} a telecom company. CNCP was created as {{a joint venture between}} the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1967, replacing the different networks used by the two railway companies (CN <b>Telegraph</b> interchanged <b>traffic</b> with the Postal Telegraph Cable Company in the US while CPR Telegraphs networked with Western Union). The two networks, former rivals, had been co-operating increasingly since the 1930s By 1980, CNCP was no longer a telegraph company and emerged as an early telecom company. A 40% stake was acquired by Rogers Communications in 1984 and CP acquired CN's stake. The network was dissolved in 1988 and Rogers renamed the company Unitel Communications Incorporated in 1989. The new company was later acquired by AT&T Canada (now Allstream). The telegram division was later acquired by iTelegram and renamed Telegrams Canada in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The Sydney-Melbourne {{coaxial cable}} was officially opened on 9 April 1962 when the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, made an interstate direct dial call.The coaxial cable {{infrastructure}} supported {{the introduction of}} subscriber trunk dialling between the cities and live television link-ups. After its commissioning in April 1962 the cable carried <b>telegraph</b> and telephone <b>traffic.</b> It also provided the first inter-city television transmission in Australia, allowing simultaneous television broadcasting in Melbourne and Sydney for the first time.The cable is understood to be decommissioned, superseded long ago by competing optical fibre cables operated by firms such as Telstra, Optus and NextGen.|$|R
50|$|From 1900 to 1940, Bulusan {{experienced}} {{major developments}} in education, government, communication, agriculture, and public health. From {{the very start}} of the American regime, free public instruction commenced. Public schools in almost all barrios were opened. In 1927, the municipal building (now housing the post office, court room, and municipal jail) and public market (undergoing another major renovation — this time a vertical development) were built. In 1930, the provincial road connecting Bulusan to the adjoining towns of Barcelona and Irosin was opened to <b>traffic.</b> <b>Telegraph</b> and mail services began. Qualified voters began enjoying the right to suffrage. A system of municipal government was instituted. Trade and commerce flourished. Development in agricultural methods was initiated. In public health, cholera and smallpox were contained. In 1939, the first municipal waterworks system was constructed.|$|R
50|$|In 1867, Georg von Siemens {{established}} the Indo-European Telegraph Company in London {{on behalf of}} Werner Siemens.

50|$|Until 1912 Southport handled <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic</b> for {{all over}} Australia. In 1912, a cable from Auckland was {{extended}} to Sydney and for a period after this, traffic for the southern States went directly to Sydney from Auckland.

5000|$|Lithuania did not {{recognize}} Polish control over Vilnius even de facto. There were no diplomatic relations between Poland and Lithuania until the ultimatum of 1938. Railroad <b>traffic,</b> <b>telegraph</b> lines, even mail could not cross the Polish-Lithuanian border. Lithuania continued to declare Vilnius as its capital in all official documents, including the constitution. Since the city was controlled by Poland, all Lithuanian authorities were transferred {{to the city of}} Kaunas, which became the seat of the government. To reconcile reality with constitutional claims, Kaunas was designated as a temporary or provisional capital until Vilnius would be [...] "liberated from Polish occupation". In March 1938 Lithuania accepted Polish ultimatum demanding to restart diplomatic relations. Despite normalized relations, the new Lithuanian Constitution of May 1938 still claimed Vilnius as the de jure capital of Lithuania and Kaunas remained as the temporary capital.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, the CPR {{became the}} first North American {{railroad}} to introduce intermodal or [...] "piggyback" [...] freight service, where truck trailers are carried on flatcars. Containers later replaced most piggyback service. Beginning in the 1960s, the railroad started to discontinue much of its passenger service (particularly on its branch lines). Passenger service ended on its line through southern British Columbia and Crow's Nest Pass in January 1964. The Dominion was dropped in January 1966. On October 29, 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to Via Rail, a new federal Crown corporation now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on January 15, 1990. This ended service by the Canadian over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former Super Continental route via Canadian National without a change in name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the January 15, 1990 cuts, thesurviving Canadian was (and is) a thrice-weekly operation.The CPR was in a powerful position during the First World War.Canadian Pacific Railway currently operates three commuter services under contract. The West Coast Express comprises ten daily trains running into downtown Vancouver on behalf of TransLink, a regional transit authority. CNCP was created as {{a joint venture between}} Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway in 1967, replacing the different networks used by the two companies.

2500|$|The Stasi {{acted as}} a proxy for KGB conduct {{activities}} in Poland, where the Soviets were not well liked. [...] When the Polish Solidarity movement arose, Stasi-KGB data was immediately handed to the Polish SB which immediately arrested hundred of Solidarity members within a few hours of declaring martial law, as demanded by the Soviets. [...] All telephone, <b>telegraph</b> and mail <b>traffic</b> in and out of Poland was put under Stasi control, while a massive Stasi Tenth Department of the Second Main Directorate (counterintelligence) was created to monitor Poland. [...] With worries throughout the Eastern Bloc of a possible collapse if communism fell in any country, the Stasi Tenth Department dispatched operational groups to Czechoslovakia and Hungary. [...] The Tenth Department, however, could not monitor the large number of discontented citizens in the Eastern Bloc in the late 1980s, with the first significant breach coming Hungary when the government therein ordered the dismantling of fortifications and barbed wire barriers along its border with Austria in August 1989. Word spread rapidly to East Germany, where thousands seeking freedom poured into Hungary. [...] Hungary ignored Stasi threats regarding closure of the border. [...] Thereafter, the battle was effectively lost, with East Germany beginning the dismantling of the Berlin Wall months later.|$|R
50|$|As the original, {{powerful}} {{spark gap}} transmitters would create {{large quantities of}} electrical interference, stations could not transmit and receive {{at the same time}} - even if different wavelengths were used. By 1913, the increasing amount of trans-Atlantic radio <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic</b> required that existing half-duplex operation be upgraded to a link which could carry messages in both directions at the same time. This was done by geographically separating the receiving stations from the existing transmitter sites; new receiving stations at Letterfrack, Ireland and Louisbourg, Nova Scotia effectively doubled the capacity of the Marconi Company to carry trans-Atlantic <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic.</b> Instead of the 500 kHz and 1 MHz frequencies common in shipboard radio at the time, Marconi was to use longwave frequencies of 37.5 kHz for transmission from Glace Bay, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia to Letterfrack and 54.5 kHz for transmission from Clifden, Ireland to Louisbourg in order to establish reliable transatlantic communication day and night.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of the American Civil War, as <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic</b> increased, the Grove cell's {{tendency}} to discharge poisonous nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fumes proved increasingly hazardous to health, and as telegraphs became more complex, the need for constant voltage became critical. The Grove cell was limited in this respect, because as the cell discharged, voltage reduced. Eventually, Grove cells were replaced in use by Daniell cells.|$|E
50|$|From 1879, postal and {{telegraph}} services were amalgamated under the Queensland Post and Telegraph Department, {{but the two}} services continued to operate separately in Rockhampton, with both a Post and Telegraph Master. In 1883 a new telegraph office was erected next to the old post office. At this time Rockhampton was the main <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic</b> centre for central and north Queensland and was the largest telegraph office outside Brisbane.|$|E
50|$|In a message-switching centre an {{incoming}} message {{is not lost}} when the required outgoing route is busy. It is stored in a queue with any other messages for the same route and retransmitted when the required circuit becomes free. Message switching is thus {{an example of a}} delay system or a queuing system. Message switching is still used for <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic</b> and a modified form of it, known as packet switching, is used extensively for data communications.|$|E
5000|$|The section {{retained}} [...] "Room 40" [...] as its informal name {{even though}} it expanded {{during the war and}} moved into other offices. It was estimated by Westwood in 2009 that Room 40 decrypted around 15,000 German communications, the section being provided with copies of all intercepted communications traffic, including wireless and <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic.</b> Alfred Ewing directed Room 40 until May 1917, when direct control passed to Captain (later Admiral) Reginald 'Blinker' Hall, assisted by William Milbourne James.|$|E
50|$|Nine Mile Road was {{constructed}} through the canyon in 1886 by the Buffalo Soldiers of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, linking Fort Duchesne to the railroad {{through the city}} of Price.

Three cable ships-CS Mercury, CS Retriever, and HMTS Monarch-did the job. The link contains 11,000 miles of telephone cable, which, at the time, provided 80 two-way speech channels or 1,760 teleprinter circuits.

The company flourished for a time but in 1928, together with other elements of the Mackay System, came under the control of International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) under a wholly owned subsidiary, the Postal Telegraph & Cable Corporation. This would be reorganized in 1935, with Commercial Cable becoming part of the American Cable and Radio Corporation. The undersea cables remained in use carrying <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic</b> until 1962. In 1998, cables were briefly visible going out to sea at Waterville and are probably still there.|$|E
50|$|Sweden made {{efforts to}} help the Allied Forces. From May 1940, {{a large part of}} the Swedish {{merchant}} navy that found itself outside the Baltic, totalling about 8,000 seamen, was leased to Britain. 300 Swedes traveled to Norway to fight the German invasion. German <b>telegraph</b> <b>traffic</b> to occupied Oslo went through Swedish-leased cables which the Swedes intercepted. The traffic was encrypted with Germany's Geheimschreiber device, but the cypher code was broken by Swedish mathematics professor Arne Beurling in early summer 1940 and the results from this espionage were sent to the Allies through the Polish resistance movement. When the German battleship Bismarck embarked on her voyage to attack the Atlantic convoys, Swedish intelligence informed the British of her departure from port. Swedish businessmen and diplomats were also actively spying for the Allies, in Berlin and in the occupied territories.|$|E
