25|$|By late 2009, multiplexes 2 and A used 64-QAM {{and were}} {{consequently}} {{more prone to}} poor reception, while the other multiplexes used 16-QAM. At switchover the <b>transmission</b> <b>mode</b> was changed from 16-QAM to 64-QAM on Multiplex 1 (PSB1), increasing the effective bandwidth of the multiplex. The switch to 64-QAM mode also provided extra bandwidth on Multiplexes C (COM5) and D (COM6).|$|E
30|$|For these problems, {{we propose}} our cross-layer schemes {{with the same}} basic steps. First, we {{identify}} all possible <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> or a subset of <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> by means of TMGA 1 or TMGA 2 given previously. Second, we formulate the problems as Linear Programming problems (LP)s and Convex Programming problems (CPs) based on the <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> found in above.

40|$|Several <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> {{are defined}} in IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g WLAN standards. A very few <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> are {{considering}} for IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g in physical layer parameters and wireless channel characteristics. In this paper, we evaluated {{the performance of}} available <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> in IEEE 802. 11 b [1]. However, the performance analysis can be done straightforward using the evaluation of IEEE 802. 11 b. The performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> are evaluated by calculating the probability of Bit Error Rate (BER) versus the Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) under the frequently used three wireless channel models (AWGN, Rayleigh and Rician) [2]. We consider the data modulation and data rate to analyze the performance that is BER vs. SNR. We also consider multipath received signals. The simulation results had shown the performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> under different channel models {{and the number of}} antennas. Based on simulation results, we observed that some <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> are not efficient in IEEE 802. 11 b. The evaluation of performance confirms the increase in the coverage area of the physical layer in the 802. 11 b WLAN devices...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{theoretical}} limits of the inference of cultural <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> based on sparse population-level data. We approach this problem by investigating whether different <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> produce different temporal dynamics of cultural change. In particular we explore whether the distributions of the average time a variant stays the most common variant in the population, denoted by tmax, conditioned on the considered <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> are sufficiently different to allow for inference of underlying <b>transmission</b> <b>modes.</b> We assume time series data detailing the frequencies of different variants of a cultural trait in a population {{at different points in}} time and investigate the temporal resolution (i. e. the length of the time series and the distance between consecutive time points) that is needed to ensure distinguishability between <b>transmission</b> <b>modes.</b> We find that under complete information most <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> can be distinguished on the base of the statistic tmax, however we should not expect the same results if only infrequent information about the most common cultural variant in the population are available...|$|R
25|$|During the consultation, 9 of the 12 {{responses}} from broadcasters were {{in favour of}} removing the restriction. These included the BBC. The BBC agreed that the digital television market had changed substantially since 2002, and that Top Up TV probably couldn't afford the current cost of DTT slots anyway. The BBC suggested that the deregulation should be conditional {{on a number of}} further changes to regulation. These included that Ofcom changes the <b>transmission</b> <b>mode</b> of broadcast on all multiplexes from 16QAM to 64QAM so more services could be squeezed onto the digital terrestrial platform. However, Ofcom rejected these suggestions, saying they were outside the scope of the consultation.|$|E
25|$|A {{calibration}} header is sent {{before the}} image. It {{consists of a}} 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, a 10ms break at 1200Hz, another 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, followed by a digital VIS (vertical interval signaling) code, identifying the <b>transmission</b> <b>mode</b> used. The VIS consists of bits of 30 milliseconds in length. The code starts with a start bit at 1200Hz, followed by 7 data bits (LSB first; 1100Hz for 1, 1300Hz for 0). An even parity bit follows, then a stop bit at 1200Hz. For example, the bits corresponding the decimal numbers 44 or 32 imply that the mode is Martin M1, whereas the number 60 represents Scottie S1.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we first}} {{introduce}} three communication <b>transmission</b> <b>modes</b> including: traditional cellular communication mode, direct D 2 D communication mode and two-way DF relayed D 2 D communication mode.

500|$|Another feature {{peculiar}} to waveguide filters {{is that there}} is a definite frequency, the cutoff frequency, below which no transmission can take place. [...] This means that in theory low-pass filters cannot be made in waveguides. [...] However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation. [...] The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter for all practical purposes if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application. [...] The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of <b>transmission</b> <b>mode,</b> so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others. [...] Likewise, the guide wavelength (λg) and characteristic impedance (Z0) of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode.|$|E

2500|$|In modems and {{wireless}} systems, link adaptation (automatic adaption {{of the data}} rate and the modulation and/or error coding scheme to the signal quality) is often applied.

2500|$|Using {{values for}} <b>Transmission</b> <b>Mode</b> I (TM I), the OFDM {{modulation}} consists of 1,536 subcarriers that are transmitted in parallel. The useful {{part of the}} OFDM symbol period is 1 millisecond, which results in the OFDM subcarriers each having a bandwidth of 1kHz [...] due to the inverse relationship between these two parameters, and the overall OFDM channel bandwidth is 1,537kHz. The OFDM guard interval for TM I is 246 microseconds, {{which means that the}} overall OFDM symbol duration is 1.246 milliseconds. The guard interval duration also determines the maximum separation between transmitters {{that are part of the}} same single-frequency network (SFN), which is approximately 74km for TM I.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two common}} {{photomultiplier}} orientations, the head-on or end-on (<b>transmission</b> <b>mode)</b> design, as shown above, where light enters the flat, circular {{top of the}} tube and passes the photocathode, and the side-on design (reflection mode), where light enters at a particular spot {{on the side of}} the tube, and impacts on an opaque photocathode. The side-on design is used, for instance, in the type 931, the first mass-produced PMT. Besides the different photocathode materials, performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through, and by the arrangement of the dynodes. Many photomultiplier models are available having various combinations of these, and other, design variables. The manufacturers manuals [...] provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application.|$|E
2500|$|Interlace, no {{dependence}} upon sync, and interline reconstruction {{gives the}} AVT modes a better noise resistance {{than any of}} the other SSTV modes. Full frame images can be [...] reconstructed with reduced resolution even if as much as 1/2 of the received signal was lost in a solid block of interference or fade because of the interlace feature. For instance, first the odd lines are sent, then the even lines. If a block of odd lines are lost, the even lines remain, and a reasonable reconstruction of the odd lines can be created by a simple vertical interpolation, resulting in a full frame of lines where the even lines are unaffected, the good odd lines are present, and the bad odd lines have been replaced with an interpolation. This is a significant visual improvement over losing a non-recoverable contiguous block of lines in a non-interlaced <b>transmission</b> <b>mode.</b> Interlace is an optional mode variation, however without it, much of the noise resistance is sacrificed, although the synchronous character of the transmission ensures that intermittent signal loss does not cause loss of the entire image.|$|E
