5|$|In Italy, Archduke John went {{up against}} Napoleon's stepson Eugène. The Austrians beat back several bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eugène <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Verona and the Adige River, but Eugène regrouped and {{launched}} a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again. By the time of Wagram, Eugène's forces had joined Napoleon's main army. In Dalmatia, Marmont, under the nominal command of Eugène, was fighting against General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops. Like Eugène, however, Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate the tempo of the conflict. He went back on the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram.|$|E
5|$|Wallace had {{financial}} difficulties {{throughout much of}} his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and Charles Lyell, he had no family wealth <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> and he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{returned}} to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen {{to win a}} place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, {{but at the same time}} suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E

50|$|Dalmatia never {{attained}} a political or racial unity and never {{formed as a}} nation, but it achieved a remarkable development of art, science and literature. Politically, the neolatin Dalmatian city-states were often isolated and compelled <b>to</b> either <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Venetian Republic for support, or {{tried to make it}} on their own.|$|R

5|$|He was {{appointed}} as Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club {{away from being}} relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious in making new signings due to financial constraints {{on the part of}} the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to go without his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were though relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> and nothing in writing.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{their two}} assaults across the Fontanone stream near Marengo village were repelled, and General Jean Lannes {{reinforced}} the French right. Bonaparte realised the true position and issued orders at 11:00 am {{to recall the}} detachment under Général de Division (GdD) Louis Desaix, while moving his reserve forward. On the Austrian left, Ott’s column had taken Castel Ceriolo, and its advance guard moved south to attack Lannes’s flank. Melas renewed the main assault and the Austrians broke the central French position. By 2:30 pm the French were withdrawing and Austrian dragoons seized the Marengo farm. Bonaparte had by then arrived with the reserve, but Berthier’s troops began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the main vine belts. Knowing Desaix was approaching, Bonaparte was anxious about a column of Ott’s soldiers marching from the north, so he deployed his Consular Guard infantry to delay it. The French then withdrew steadily eastward toward San Giuliano Vecchio as the Austrians formed a column to follow them in line with Ott’s advance in the northern sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildup of}} {{vehicles}} and men {{trying to use}} the crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose to head up and over the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E

5|$|To the Allies, the Belgian {{failure to}} hold onto its eastern frontiers (they {{were thought to be}} capable of holding out for two weeks), was a disappointment. The Allied Chiefs of Staff had sought to avoid an {{encounter}} mobile battle without any strong fixed defences <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> and hoped Belgian resistance would last long enough for a defensive line to be established. Nevertheless, a brief lull fell on the Dyle front on 11 May which enabled the Allied armies to get into position by the time the first major assault was launched the following day. Allied cavalry had moved into position and infantry and artillery were reaching the front more slowly, by rail. Although unaware of it, the First Allied army Group and the Belgian Army outnumbered and outgunned Walther von Reichenau's German 6th Army.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E
5|$|The 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont's {{division}} marched from Haslach towards Ulm and {{ran into}} four Austrian regiments holding Boefingen. The 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks, but the Austrians held firm and repulsed every one. The Austrians flooded the battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to Ulm-Jungingen hoping to score a knockout blow against Ney's corps by enveloping Dupont's force. Dupont sensed {{what was happening and}} preempted the Austrians by launching a surprise attack on Jungingen, during which he took as prisoner at least 1,000 of the Austrians. Renewed Austrian attacks drove these forces back to Haslach, which the French managed to hold. Dupont was eventually forced <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Albeck, where he joined Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers's foot dragoons division. The effects of the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on Napoleon's plans are not fully clear, but the Emperor may have finally ascertained {{that the majority of the}} Austrian army was concentrated at Ulm. Accordingly, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were still guarding the region around Munich. Napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture the important bridges around Ulm. He also began shifting his forces to the north of Ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of the city itself. These dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at Elchingen on the 14th as Ney's forces advanced on Albeck.|$|E

He would have felt kinder to her had she shown any [...] "airs and graces," [...] which he could have commented upon and forgiven.

25|$|The Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway {{had long}} been proposed, and it was finally opened on 2 November 1877, leaving the Charlestown line at Charlestown Junction. It had been {{conceived}} as an alternative route for ferry passengers crossing the Forth at Queensferry. It was promoted independently, and the North British Railway had promised financial support, but as it became increasingly likely that a Forth Bridge would soon be built, the NBR lost interest, and the little company had <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> its own resources. It used a Comely Park passenger station in Dunfermline (later renamed Dunfermline Lower in 1890) and Townhill Junction at Dunfermline faced eastwards.|$|E

25|$|That night French supply convoys {{caught up}} and each soldier {{received}} two rations {{of bread and}} 60 cartridges. Desjardin issued orders for a renewed advance at noon on 12 May. Marceau was to march to Fontaine-l'Évêque while Jacob moved to Mont-Sainte-Geneviève. The columns of Duhesme, Fromentin and Muller were directed to converge on Merbes-le-Château while Despeaux would seize Hantes. On the extreme right, Vezú took position at Montigny-le-Tilleul. Kaunitz massed his forces in three main bodies at Merbes-le-Château, Rouveroy and Péchant (Peissant) while directing Kienmayer to slow the French advance.
