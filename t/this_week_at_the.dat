5000|$|The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle {{gave the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "When Gotham aired its fall finale back in November, {{one of the}} biggest issues with the episode was that the crux of its {{dramatic}} tension was derived from the threat posed to Bruce Wayne by Theo Galavan. Galavan, up until that episode, had been a somewhat interesting character. His vision of total destruction in Gotham, aided by his run as Mayor of the city, brought a sense of clarity to a show that had often traded in case-of-the-week villains that boasted little staying power or genuine intrigue. Galavan felt different, like a person who could truly exploit the corrupt nature of Gothams bureaucratic, political and criminal systems. Then, Galavan went after Bruce in the fall finale because of an ancient blood feud and everything went off the rails because, spoiler alert, Bruce Wayne isn’t going to die. It's a shame that Gotham chooses {{to go back to the}} well with Galavan and Bruce because Azrael is (was?) a promising character. Last week's episode positioned him as a rather unstoppable force, only to have him fall <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hands of Cobblepot, Butch, and their rocket launcher. The campy fun of Butch and Cobblepot showing up to save Gordon and kill Galavan aside, the story falls flat. It's actually baffling that Gotham feels the need to not only resurrect Galavan, but to then have him once again go after Bruce Wayne. 'Unleashed' is nearly the same in structure and tone to 'Rise Of The Villains: Worse Than A Crime,' meaning that the episode just feels like a coda that nobody wanted to a resolution we already received." ...|$|E
