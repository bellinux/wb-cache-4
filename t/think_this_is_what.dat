He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete (i.e.Peter Walker) and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn't want to shoot him. I could have shot a lot more.|$|E
500|$|Whorf {{graduated}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1918 {{with a degree in}} chemical engineering where his academic performance was of average quality. In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee. Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf how he knew about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: [...] "You couldn't do it in any other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though I have never met her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, it is sort of common property, for people to take ideas from and use, and I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened to my books." ...|$|E
5000|$|And also: “As an artist, {{it is very}} {{important}} for me to trust the participants - whom I approach (right away) as equals, and whose contributions are an element of the project. I <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> makes it possible to produce the work: trust in the other person’s intelligence.” ...|$|R
5000|$|What {{happens when}} you mix Defender, Scramble and Chopper Rescue together, and put them out as one game? About {{the same thing as}} mixing ice cream, {{spaghetti}} and steak. By themselves they're each terrific, but when mixed together they make something that you don't even want to <b>think</b> about. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened in Fort Apocalypse.|$|R

Gossamer Wump is a little kid who saw a big parade comin' {{down the road and}} <b>thinks</b> 'Hey, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I want, I want to be a musician.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The public's {{reaction}} {{towards the}} documentary has been positive. MTV asked various fans in New York and Los Angeles, California {{what they thought}} about the film, a fan quoted, [...] "It made me love her even more," [...] Shanna Birnbaum, 23, told MTV News. [...] "I think she was very honest. She really let her true self shine through. It showed people and young girls you can get through anything." [...] Stacey Medura, agreed, adding that [...] "For the Record" [...] humanized the pop star. [...] "It's easier to understand how she feels," [...] Medura said. [...] "Her opinion matters most. I think she covered a lot [...]" [...] Some said this look into Britney's life was inspiring. [...] "I really have gained {{a lot of respect}} for her now," [...] Derek wrote. [...] "I felt like this was the first time since she burst onto the scene a decade ago that she has spoken from the heart. ... I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> fans and others have wanted from her for a long time, to be honest. Her honesty can be helpful for others who may be going through situations like hers, such as dealing with a custody battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|Major Hendricks grunted. [...] "Here." [...] He {{passed it}} to his companions. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we've been waiting for. They {{certainly}} took their time about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] shouted Mavering, [...] "I {{certainly}} shouldn't. I don't see how anybody stands it. Ponkwasset Falls is {{bad enough}} in the winter, and compared to this region Ponkwasset Falls is a metropolis. I believe in getting all the good you can {{out of the world}} you were born in--of course without hurting anybody else." [...] He stretched his legs out on the bed of sweet-fern, where he had thrown himself, and rested his head on his hand lifted on his elbow. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> this place is fit for--a picnic; and I wish every one well out of it for nine months of the year." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rabe studied {{dance for}} ten years. She was {{teaching}} ballet at a summer arts program in Connecticut, {{when she was}} approached by the program's acting instructor, who asked her to perform a monologue in the final production. Rabe performed a monologue from the play Crimes of the Heart by Beth Henley. She stated, [...] "It was that moment, performing that monologue, that made me <b>think,</b> 'Maybe <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I wanna do'." [...] Rabe {{then went on to}} study acting at Northwestern University, from which she graduated in 2004.|$|R
2500|$|Her speech {{also sought}} to express the idea that really terrible things happen to good people: [...] "I would call it, in terms of writing, in terms of poetry, it's a laundry list. Because all you're doing is: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> who we <b>are,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we <b>think,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we feel, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> why - you know?... I just wanted to admit, you know, that we didn't deserve this, and nobody does. And so I wanted to link our tragedy, in every sense, you know - we're no {{different}} from anything else that has hurt...." ...|$|R
50|$|Maria (Lea van Acken), is a 14-year-old Catholic {{girl in a}} religiously fanatic {{family who}} has {{dedicated}} her life to serving God. She is preparing {{with a group of}} young people for confirmation in a southern German town. Their church belongs to the Society of St Paul that rejects the more secular rulings of the Second Vatican Council, and holds to the Latin mass. Learning of the 14 Stations of the Cross that Jesus endured on his path to Golgotha, she <b>thinks</b> that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> she also must go through in order to reach Heaven, and potentially cure her younger brother's autism.|$|R

It is {{the song that}} brought {{her back into the}} limelight after it featured in a commercial in 1982, yet it wasn't a song she particularly liked or wished to be remembered by.|$|E
5000|$|Clarke {{announced}} his retirement from AFL on 24 September 2009, citing his desire to return home and to play Gaelic football, which he said had prompted him to decline the offer of another three-year contract in Australia and that [...] "I could easily have stayed. But I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I want to do more. I am more passionate about playing for Down than playing for Collingwood." ...|$|E
60|$|He asked compassionately {{if there}} was {{anything}} he could do for me, and, of course, there was something he could do, but were I to propose it I doubted not he would be on his stilts at once, for already I had reason to know him for a haughty, sensitive dog, who ever became high at the first hint of help. So the proposal must come from him. I spoke of the many little things in the house that were now hurtful to me to look upon, and he clutched my hand, deeply moved, though it was another house with its little things he saw. I was ashamed to harass him thus, but he had not a sufficiency of the little things, and besides my impulsiveness had plunged me into a deuce of a mess, so I went on distastefully. Was there no profession in this age of specialism for taking away children's garments from houses where they were suddenly become a pain? Could I sell them? Could I give them to the needy, who would probably dispose of them for gin? I told him of a friend with a young child who had already refused them because it would be unpleasant to him to be reminded of Timothy, and I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> touched him to the quick, so that he made the offer I was waiting for.|$|R
5000|$|In the [...] "Definitions" [...] {{chapter of}} Jung's [...] work Psychological Types, under the {{definition}} of [...] "collective" [...] Jung references representations collectives, a term coined by Lucien Lévy-Bruhl in his 1910 book How Natives <b>Think.</b> Jung says <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he describes as the collective unconscious. Freud, on the other hand, did not accept {{the idea of a}} collective unconscious.|$|R
6000|$|It most froze {{me to hear}} such talk. He wouldn't ever {{dared to}} talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a {{difference}} it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, [...] "Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell." [...] <b>Thinks</b> I, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> comes of my not thinking. Here <b>was</b> <b>this</b> nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.|$|R
5000|$|... “We {{are among}} the few labs who are {{interested}} in this very unique area of the brain: the coverings of the brain - the so-called ‘meninges.’ We’ve been looking into this area for a few years now,” Kipnis said. “I was lucky to have a phenomenal post-doctoral fellow in my lab, Dr. Antoine Louveau, who developed a very unique technique of mounting this entire covering as a whole-mount. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> allowed us to find those vessels.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Well, I {{really want}} to {{encourage}} a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it - I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think {{we live in an}} age where we're just hammered, hammered to <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the world is. Television's saying, everything's saying 'That's the world.' And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.|$|E
5000|$|Firrell {{has worked}} with complex and {{influential}} organisations including the Church of England (St Paul's Cathedral 2008) and The British Army (Household Division 2009). Canon Martin Warner, commissioner of Firrell's work for St Paul's stated in the cathedral's 2008 Annual Report that Firrell possesses [...] "a genius for creating partnerships". Arguably, it's this ability that has enabled organisations to engage confidently with audacious, self-questioning project content including [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> God intended" [...] (West Front, St Paul's Cathedral) and [...] "War is always a failure" [...] (North elevation, Guards Chapel).|$|E
5000|$|Lou Ranieri of Salomon Brothers, {{creator of}} the mortgage-backed {{securities}} market in the 1970s, warned of the future impact of mortgage defaults: [...] "This is {{the leading edge of}} the storm…If you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> bad, imagine <b>what</b> it's going to be like in the middle of the crisis." [...] In his opinion, more than $100 billion of home loans are likely to default when the problems seen in the subprime industry also emerge in the prime mortgage markets.|$|R
5000|$|On April 4, the Faculty Senate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to protect academic freedom. The body decided, according to University Committee Chair Judith Burstyn, that the university needed to take a public position to defend academic freedom {{in the wake of}} the FOIA records request directed at Cronon. Political scientist Howard Schweber, who was involved in writing the resolution alongside colleague Donald Downs, commented: [...] "The university can't change the law, but the university can take a leading position on behalf of public employees everywhere and make a statement that we <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> wrong. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> begun as a classic notion of sunshine being the best disinfectant has turned into a law that's used as a weapon to target not government officials and offices but individual public employees." ...|$|R
25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another sense. He <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> position <b>was</b> <b>what</b> John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I {{will argue that the}} Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|R

[...] " [...] Williams was content with her meal and remarked that the [...] "pancakes were made of chickpea flour (the chickpeas’ main contribution was a lovely, rich density, with only the whiff of their flavour), packed with spinach, in a tomato and cream sauce".|$|E
50|$|If {{you use a}} good vaccine you {{can prevent}} the {{transmission}} within poultry and to humans. But {{if they have been}} using vaccines now China for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can't blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world.|$|E
50|$|Kelly {{is waiting}} outside the brownstone as Crystal {{comes out with}} a pail and a brush to wash away the blood of her children. Kelly walks {{up to her and}} Crystal asks if she's awake, to which Kelly, who is speechless, nods her head. Crystal {{comments}} that she does not feel awake and <b>thinks</b> that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> death must feel like. Nyla passes by and Kelly takes her into Crystal's apartment to wash her up. Hearing Tangie bring in yet another suitor to her apartment, Nyla confronts her. Tangie kicks her suitor out after he asks her to invite Nyla for a threesome. Tangie and Nyla hash out their problems, before Tangie reveals that her life is complicated and she's still learning from her mistakes ("No More Love Poems #4"). Afterwards, Tangie and Nyla reconcile.|$|R
2500|$|In late 2010, Hopkins {{suggested}} that African American fighters who possessed {{what he described}} as a [...] "slick" [...] inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. [...] "Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but I <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said at people's homes and around the dinner table among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [...] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. But I do think that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting." ...|$|R

Wallace:Bob Jewson said one thing - and I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we {{tried to make the}} theme of the film, although it was very hidden - that riots don't happen out of the blue. The prison authorities make you believe that all these criminals that are incarcerated are at all times dangerous and they're trying to get out. But Bob said that's never true; most of them have accepted their lot and they're trying to serve their time. They only get into a riot situation when they're treated badly and unfairly over a long period. He said most people don't want a riot; they know what it's going to mean, longer in jail.|$|E

Did we manage to do it - it's a question for audience. But I'm pleased with this work. On the other hand the genre of nu metal is narrow-minded so we can't avoid comparisons with other bands. If desired you can hear there Clawfinger, Rammstein. Clawfinger is even more: My war resembles Live Like A Man. I won't say that it's quite the same but just listening to Clawfinger pushed me to use such a riff. But unlike the Swedes we leave some place for melodious songs. There are two of them in Outcast. Besides every word in our album is audible.|$|R

That inadequacy can make you implode with a lot of disgust. It can become the gestalt of who you are.
