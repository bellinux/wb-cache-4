2500|$|On November 3, {{the winner}} {{remained}} undetermined; write-in ballots comprised 41% of the vote, Miller had 34%, and McAdams had 24%. McAdams later conceded, {{but the result}} required a hand-count of the write-in ballots to see what names were written on them. Miller's campaign manager announced that several teams, including attorneys, would be going to Alaska to watch the ballot count. Miller gained about 2,100 votes in the count of absentee ballots that was done on November 9 in Juneau, and trailed the write-in votes by 11,333 {{at the end of}} the day. The hand count of the write-in ballots began on November 10. After two days, the Alaska Division of Elections had examined about 48 percent of the ballots and had tallied about 98 percent of them as votes for Murkowski, despite objections from Miller's <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> to spelling errors, legibility, and additional words such as [...] "Republican". When the last of the more than 100,000 write-in votes were counted on November 17, the Associated Press and the Republican Party of Alaska called the race for Murkowski. At that point, Murkowski's lead was more than 2,000 votes larger than the number of ballots challenged by Miller. On November 18, Murkowski declared victory, but Miller did not concede the race.|$|E

5000|$|The {{expert group}} {{concluded}} that {{the items in the}} questionnaire dealing with nationality and language proved to be the most sensitive, particularly with reference to the recording of responses to these questions as being [...] "Moldovan" [...] or [...] "Romanian". While {{a large proportion of the}} population had spontaneously provided an answer to the question, seven <b>of</b> the ten <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> had reported cases where enumerators encouraged respondents to declare that they were Moldovan rather than Romanian. Moreover, the reports from the field also showed that even within the same family there often seemed to be some confusion about these terms. Since problems of this type had been reported by the <b>teams</b> <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> in many different parts of the country, and in fairly large number, the expert group concluded that special care would be required by the National Statistics Bureau to enable it to assess the quality of the data on nationality/ethnicity.|$|R

50|$|Proxy voting {{played an}} {{important}} role in Guyana politics in the 1960s. Prior to and during the 1961 elections, proxies had been severely restricted. Some restrictions were lifted, and there was a rise in proxy votes cast from 300 in 1961 to 6,635 in 1964. After that election, the Commonwealth <b>Team</b> <b>of</b> <b>Observers</b> voiced concern about proxy votes being liable to fraud. The proxy voting rules were relaxed further, and in 1969, official figures recorded 19,287 votes cast by proxy, about 7% of the total votes cast (an increase from 2.5% in 1964 to 1968). Amidst allegations of fraud, more restrictions were placed on proxy voting in 1973; in that year, about 10,000 votes were cast by proxy.|$|E
