Diets high in high-saturated as well as monounsaturated-fat can also increase SCD-1 expression, although not to the extent of the lipogenic effect of a high-carb diet.|$|R

5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop.

5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
5|$|Helium–cadmium lasers are {{a common}} source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422nm in {{fluorescence}} microscopes and various laboratory experiments. Cadmium selenide quantum dots emit bright luminescence under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size. Colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> solutions with a fluorescence microscope.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> bones, damages the nervous system, and causes blood disorders. It is particularly problematic in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Priapism is a persis-tent {{and often}} painful penile {{erection}} in the ab-sence of sexual stimulation. It can cause pro-gressive fibrosis, edema and drying of the erec-tile <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> {{then it can}} lead to erectile dys-function. Previous studies suggested that, neu-ronal nitric oxide levels increased during the pri-apism. High NO levels can result in the forma-tion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress in <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> reproductive sys-tem. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate oxida-tive and nitrosative effects caused by priapism in cavernosal <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> serum, and determinate beneficial effects of lycopene on ischemic pri-apism...|$|R

Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E
5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells, <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> organs {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{recognized}} that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that re-compression could relieve the symptoms, Paul Bert showed in 1878 that decompression sickness is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> blood during or after decompression, and showed the advantages of breathing oxygen after developing decompression sickness.|$|E

5|$|The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, {{contains}} multicellular {{organisms that}} are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> {{these animals are}} also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, {{with one or two}} openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
40|$|Endothelin-mediated {{vasoconstriction}} may theoretically aggravate ischemic neuronal damage. Although {{investigators have}} demonstrated that endothelins are produced by cerebral microvessel endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons in vitro, whether endothelins are produced during cerebral ischemia is still unclear. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to measure endothelin- 1 in brain <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> plasma following middle cerebral artery occlusion and {{to examine the relationship}} between brain <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> plasma endothelin- 1 levels. The middle cerebral artery of rabbits was occluded for 2, 4 or 24 h. The amount of endothelin- 1 in both brain <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> plasma was determined by RIA. The results demonstrate that the concentrations of endothelin- 1 in the ischemic brain <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> plasma are both significantly increased after focal cerebral ischemia (P < 0. 01). The data confirm that an acute and marked increase of endothelin- 1 in brain <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> plasma is associated with focal ischemic events. The possibility that endothelin- 1 has a role in neuronal cell damage following focal ischemia warrants further attention...|$|R

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian <b>tissues,</b> <b>and</b> are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
