5|$|Wave action took {{a toll on}} the {{foundations}} of waterfront structures along the coasts of Baldwin and Mobile counties, where Elena inflicted about $715,000 worth of damage to roadways. Most damage was concentrated near the shore, where extensive erosion took place, and on islands and minor peninsulas. Farther inland, Elena's impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines. The storm destroyed the city boardwalk at Gulf Shores, {{with the cost of}} rebuilding expected to approach $300,000. Alabama Power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100,000 customers. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Insurance</b> Information Institute, storm-related damages in Alabama totaled about $100 million.
