40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} whether early rehabilitation reduces {{the occurrence of}} posttotal hip arthroplasty (THA) complications, adverse events, and medical expenses within one postoperative year. Method. We retrospectively retrieve data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who had undergone THA {{during the period from}} 1998 to 2010 were recruited, matched for propensity scores, and divided into 2 groups: early rehabilitation (Early Rehab) and delayed rehabilitation (Delayed Rehab). Results. Eight hundred twenty of 999 THA patients given early rehabilitation treatments were matched to 205 of 233 THA patients given delayed rehabilitation treatments. <b>The</b> Delayed <b>Rehab</b> group had significantly (all p< 0. 001) higher medical and rehabilitation expenses and more outpatient department (OPD) visits than <b>the</b> Early <b>Rehab</b> group. In addition, <b>the</b> Delayed <b>Rehab</b> group was associated with more prosthetic infection (odds ratio (OR) : 3. 152; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 211 – 8. 203; p< 0. 05) than <b>the</b> Early <b>Rehab</b> group.

500|$|Californication {{received}} favorable {{reviews in}} contrast to its less popular predecessor, One Hot Minute, {{and it was a}} greater success worldwide. Rolling Stone credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: [...] " [...] vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over <b>the</b> <b>rehab,</b> and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility." [...] Songs such as [...] "Otherside" [...] and [...] "Porcelain" [...] were called [...] "Pumpkins-esque", while the album as a whole was [...] "epiphanal" [...] and the [...] "RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick." [...] Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. AllMusic's Greg Prato said that the [...] "obvious reason for [...] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante", considering him to be the [...] "quintessential RHCP guitarist". The album as a whole was [...] "a bona fide Chili Peppers classic". Entertainment Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a [...] "more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before". Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that [...] "'This Velvet Glove' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock," [...] Woodlief continued [...] "the disco intro to 'Parallel Universe' gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante's Hendrix-like excursions at the song's close." ...|$|E

The Uplift Mofo Party Plan proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums, registering at number 148 on the Billboard 200. Following the Uplift tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed. On 28 June 1988, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: [...] "I didn't really {{know how to deal with}} that sadness, and I don't think [...] knew how to deal with it either."

2500|$|In {{order to}} restore their career, in 1997 Farian agreed {{to produce a}} new Milli Vanilli album with Morvan and Pilatus on lead vocals.
