5|$|On 2 March, a 15-second {{television}} ad aired during Saturday Night Live (SNL) depicting an animated, stylized {{version of}} the band's logo and the aforementioned image of the helmets. The music featured in the ad {{was a result of}} the collaboration with Rodgers, who noted that various fan remixes of the clip appeared online after the airing. A second <b>TV</b> <b>ad</b> also premiered that was similar to the first on Saturday Night Live, but with a different music clip and the title Random Access Memories in place of the stylized Daft Punk logo. During the first night of Coachella Festival 2013, a third trailer debuted that featured Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams and Rodgers performing, as well as a list of collaborators on the album.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the different values in TV advertisements targeting younger Chinese (13 - 29), Older Chinese (55 or above), Younger Americans (13 - 34), and older Americans (55 or above) using Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) individualism-collectivism dimensions. With the open door policy imposed in China, younger Chinese became Westernized. A content analysis of 566 <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> was examined to test the degree of individualism, collectivism, modernity themes, and traditional themes in <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> among the four target groups. Three hypotheses and one research question guiding this study proposed that <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> targeting younger Chinese would score higher in individualism and modernity; <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> targeting older Chinese would score higher in collectivism and tradition; and <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> targeting Americans in general would score higher in individualism and modernity than <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> targeting younger Chinese. These hypotheses were partly supported. Results showed that <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> targeting younger Chinese score high in individualism, but not modernity. Also, <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> targeting Americans score higher than <b>TV</b> <b>ads</b> targeting younger Chinese. Moreover, the {{study also found that}} there is no value difference between the two target groups in the U. S. The findings and future research are discussed...|$|R

Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences, particularly for young people? As always, I remain agnostic on the matter. Who knows, really? The debate will never be resolved. The American military obviously thinks there's something there: The troubling new <b>TV</b> <b>ad</b> campaign for the U.S. reserves lures potential young soldiers with tales of adventure accompanied by blatant, video-game-styled animation. And, curiously, no one has complained about or tried to ban , in which stealth and killing figure even more heavily than in Manhunt.|$|E
