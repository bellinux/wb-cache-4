Using monthly data for the UK for the period 2004 (1) to 2008 (12) we examine various forecasting models that incorporate Google <b>Trends</b> <b>search</b> information. We find clear evidence that Google <b>Trends</b> data on <b>searches</b> relevant to cinema visits do {{have the potential to}} increase the accuracy of cinema admissions forecasting models. There is also some evidence to suggest that Google Trends indexes based on combined information from searches using a number of different search terms work better than those based on only a single keyword. The results also appear to confirm earlier findings that the UK cinema admissions series is more suitably modelled by the use of fixed seasonal dummies than through autoregressive formulations...|$|R

As a testimony to this fact, the present work purports to encouraging the use of such “Smart Analytics ” techniques by presenting <b>Trend</b> <b>Search</b> based inferences and discussion of interest in the four social networking sites Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat in 30 different countries around the world. The results provide valuable insights into group trends such as the rise, saturation and decline in the interests of such services and their dependence on various factors such as internet connection speeds and penetration rates, while also exploring exceptional cases and other individual aspects of social networking trends. While from a managerial perspective, such results can be used to assess market trends and demands, the inferences also provide useful information to administrators and governments, as well as the common man to understand the current trends and plan investments of time and money accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Modern urban {{performance}} depends {{not only}} on the city's endorsement of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (intellectual capital and social capital). This is one of the clear reasons why the concept of Smart Cities recently attracted a great amount of attention, both from academia and city planners. One of the challenges of the Smart City concept is how to raise human capital among people, such as making them culturally sensitive, mobile and to improve other social characteristics. This challenge is especially valid for industrial cities that are facing economic turbulence and a demand for revitalizing their public spaces and economic specialties. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the correlation between the amount of international students in Russian universities with the positive changes that occur in a Russian student’s human capital, and their neighbourhood areas, especially in public spaces. We aim to support the hypothesis that a network of “internationalized” universities serves as a revitalization measure for a city, facilitating the development of its surrounding areas, and reducing political and social risks within a society. Research methods for gathering data are: deductive <b>trend</b> <b>search,</b> which uses a literature review from leading academic journals and the empirical study based on the created questionnaire. This questionnaire forms a dataset which consists of a number of master courses held in English from one of the leading Russian universities based in Moscow.

40|$|Black hat {{search engine}} {{optimization}} (SEO) campaigns attract and monetize traffic using abusive schemes. Using {{a combination of}} Web site compromise, keyword stuffing and cloaking, a SEO botnet operator can manipulate search engine rankings for key search terms, ultimately directing users to sites promoting some kind of scam (e. g., fake antivirus). In this paper, we infiltrate an influential SEO botnet, GR, characterize its dynamics and effectiveness and identify the key scams driving its innovation. Surprisingly, we find that, unlike e-mail spam botnets, this botnet is both modest in size and has low churn—suggesting little adversarial pressure from defenders. Belying its small size, however, the GR botnet is able to successfully “juice ” the rankings of <b>trending</b> <b>search</b> terms and, during its peak, {{appears to have been}} the dominant source of <b>trending</b> <b>search</b> term poisoning for Google. Finally, we document the range of scams it promoted and the role played by fake anti-virus programs in driving innovation. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that search volumes {{of the most popular}} search engine worldwide, Google, provided via Google Trends, could be associated with national suicide rates in the USA, UK, and some Asian countries. However, search volumes have mostly been studied in an ad hoc fashion, without controls for spurious associations. This study evaluated the validity and utility of Google <b>Trends</b> <b>search</b> volumes for behavioral forecasting of suicide rates in the USA, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Suicide-related search terms were systematically collected and respective Google <b>Trends</b> <b>search</b> volumes evaluated for availability. Time spans covered 2004 to 2010 (USA, Switzerland) and 2004 to 2012 (Germany, Austria). Temporal associations of search volumes and suicide rates were investigated with time-series analyses that rigorously controlled for spurious associations. The number and reliability of analyzable search volume data increased with country size. Search volumes showed various temporal associations with suicide rates. However, associations differed both across and within countries and mostly followed no discernable patterns. The total number of significant associations roughly matched the number of expected Type I errors. These results suggest that the validity of Google <b>Trends</b> <b>search</b> volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates is low. The utility and validity of search volumes for the forecasting of suicide rates depend on two key assumptions ("the population that conducts searches consists mostly of individuals with suicidal ideation", "suicide-related search behavior is strongly linked with suicidal behavior"). We discuss strands of evidence that these two assumptions are likely not met. Implications for future research with Google Trends in the context of suicide research are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Comparing {{bandwidth}} {{growth with}} Internet content growth reveals that, {{given the current}} <b>trend,</b> <b>search</b> en-gines with a centrally hosted index will show rapidly decreasing quality of service over time. These considerations are backed by the numbers on search engine coverage and the latest research on size and growth comparisons between the web &quot; and the web&quot;. On the other hand, today's business application architectures have tobe -centric&quot;, meaning that selected parts of the business processes have to be accessible via the Internet. For example, customers {{should be able to}} place their orders via the world wide web or should be able to search theproduct catalog online. Current software architectures provide simple HTML search forms that usually cover only the contents of one particular web application and yield results in proprietary formats, deprived of structure. This approach limits public search engines ' chances to navigate a site's contents and thus makes it di cult to place global queries across multiple sites of this kind. Thus, increasingly signi cant parts of the web &quot; remain hidden from search engines. This article discusses the limits of today's search engine architectures and presents an approach that reverses the paradigm of Internet search: instead of search engines doing all the work (discovery, harvesting, indexing and retrieval) the approach is based on content providers actively contributing to the searchability of the content served by them. The paper will demonstrate how modern distributed object technology helps in designing and implementing this approach. A prototype is used to validate the concepts. Furthermore, it shows how new applications, using e. g. J 2 EE as their component architecture, can be integrated with this approach by modeling their searchability in UML and automatically generating the required framework adapters...|$|E
