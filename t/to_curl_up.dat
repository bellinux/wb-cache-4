They have a natural instinct to chase and enjoy playing a game of fetch. They tend to become calm and relaxed {{at the end of the}} day, likely <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> at their owner's feet.|$|E
500|$|The Monodontidae lack dorsal fins, {{which have}} been {{replaced}} by tough, fibrous ridges just behind the midpoints of their [...] bodies and are probably an adaptation to swimming under ice, as both do in their Arctic habitat. The flippers are small, rounded and tend <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> at the ends in adulthood. All, or almost all, the cervical vertebrae are unfused, allowing their heads to be turned independently of their bodies. None has any throat grooves.|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] {{received}} universal {{critical acclaim}} and {{is regarded as}} one of the musical and lyrical highlights of All I Ever Wanted. Ryan Brockington from The New York Post called the song a [...] "mixture of old school Stevie Nicks and some Julia Roberts romantic comedy theme song, delivered together in true Clarkson fashion." [...] He continues, [...] "she spits emotion and heart into a song that makes me want <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> in a blanket and long for someone". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said Clarkson [...] "knows that the anguish she likes to sing about is enjoyed by millions of people as grandiose admissions of vulnerability. Yet the music that delivers that message is anything but vulnerable. There's a reason they call them power ballads: a sad song blasted at full volume is a metaphor for finding strength in pain." [...] His point was echoed by Danton of [...] The Hartford Courant, who stated that Clarkson [...] "pours on the heartache", and by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, who called the song an [...] "extravagant ballad".|$|E

2500|$|Keith William Robert Fletcher OBE (20 May 1944, Worcester, Worcestershire, England) is an English former cricketer, {{who played}} for Essex and England. He later became England's team manager. His {{nickname}} was [...] "The Gnome of Essex", so christened by his Essex teammate, Ray East, because Fletcher's winklepickers had begun <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> at the toes due to wear.|$|E
2500|$|The SkyCouch {{has earned}} the {{nickname}} [...] "cuddle class" [...] by media reporting on the innovative seating, from the ability for couples <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> and [...] "cuddle" [...] together on the [...] flat surface. Concerns were raised almost immediately over the couch potentially being {{a new way to}} join the mile high club. Air New Zealand responded that public displays of affection of that level would not be tolerated in its aircraft. The airline even released a billboard advertisement entitled [...] "The Economy SkyCouch activity guide", suggesting [...] "spoons" [...] (hugs) were allowed, but [...] "forks" [...] (sexual activity) were not.|$|E
2500|$|A single {{spun yarn}} may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another. [...] In plying, {{two or more}} yarns are spun together, almost always in the {{opposite}} sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. [...] The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. [...] Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. [...] Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. [...] The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} of proteins is traditionally {{described in a}} hierarchy of four levels. The primary {{structure of}} a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, [...] "alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-…". Secondary structure is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> in a coil called an α-helix or into a sheet called a β-sheet; some α-helixes {{can be seen in}} the hemoglobin schematic above. Tertiary structure is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6 with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in sickle-cell disease. Finally, quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{morphology}} {{resembles that}} of their terrestrial cousin, the woodlouse: their bodies are dorso-ventrally compressed, protected by a rigid, calcareous exoskeleton composed of overlapping segments. Like some woodlice, they also possess the ability <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> into a [...] "ball", where only the tough shell is exposed. This provides protection from predators trying to strike at the more vulnerable underside. The first shell segment is fused to the head; the most posterior segments are often fused as well, forming a [...] "caudal shield" [...] over the shortened abdomen (pleon). The large eyes are compound with nearly 4,000 facets, , and spaced far apart on the head. There are two pairs of antennae. The uniramous thoracic legs or pereiopods are arranged in seven pairs, {{the first of which}} are modified into maxillipeds to manipulate and bring food to the four sets of jaws. The abdomen has five segments called pleonites each with a pair of biramous pleopods; these are modified into swimming legs and rami, flat respiratory structures acting as gills. The isopods are a pale lilac or pinkish in colour.|$|E
2500|$|She {{released}} a second book in 2003, titled Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown. The book, which was previously known as Good and Evil, chronicled nine case studies during {{her life as}} a Wiccan healer and gives explanations as to why those events happened. To promote the book, Chakraverti held a healing session at Oxford Bookstore in Kolkata, where she read excerpts from the book, and gave demonstration of her healing skills, holding the hand of a volunteer, tapping her with her athame (wand) and reciting Egyptian chants. After its release, the book received positive reaction from critics. Rajdeep Bains from The Tribune commented [...] "Sacred Evil is a very coherent account of the author’s dealings with witchcraft and sorcery. Unfortunately, it could add to superstition, which is already prevalent at an unhealthy level in our country. As a work of fiction it would have been laudable; given the cover of truth it becomes a dangerous piece of writing. [...] But what makes Sacred Evil so interesting is the juxtaposition of modern thought with the ageless. After every chapter there are notes on the practices described in it along with modern explanations." [...] Krithika Ranjan from The Hindu commented, [...] "Throughout [...] Chakraverti refers to herself as a skeptic. Yet the stories she tells are bound to raise the ire of [...] rationalists. You can almost hear one spluttering about superstition as you read the story Those who return. [...] In the final analysis, the book is a good read— whether you believe in the dark arts or whether you just want <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> with a spine chiller." [...] Chakraverti started working on her third book, tentatively titled Every Strong Woman is a Witch.|$|E

2500|$|Eleanor Gower of the Daily Mail {{thought the}} slow moving number shows Rihanna at her most vulnerable. A {{reviewer}} of The Huffington Post commented, [...] "The heartfelt ballad, from her latest album Unapologetic, {{is full of}} emotion - and the video matches that, as a stripped-down Rihanna soaks in a tub." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times commented on the video saying, [...] "we kind of want <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> in a hot shower {{and have a good}} cry ourselves." [...] They continued saying, [...] "It's kind of an echo of her famous [...] "We Found Love" [...] video, with that clip's quick-cut, drugged-up frenzy of bad romance replaced with solitary, locked-off shots that feel more intimate than exploitative. She looks amazing, but the focus isn't so much her body as the look of constant devastation on her face." [...] Brown summarised the clip as being [...] "appropriately minimalist" [...] and concluded calling it [...] "a beautiful video that broaden's Rihanna's emotional-musical palette." [...] Bené Viera of VH1 commented on the video saying, [...] "Usually the tough girl posturing is a cover up for a very sensitive soul. Rihanna cut the 'I don't give an eff' attitude for four minutes of makeup free, teary-eyed, glistening wet, raw emotion in the video for 'Stay.'" [...] Sarah Flanigan of Yahoo! thought the video shows [...] "a softer side of [...] personality audiences rarely get to see." [...] She also stated, [...] "There are no gimmicks, no flashy clothes, just a very raw and emotional performance allowing her to tell this love story in her own words." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV labelled the video as [...] "perfectly heartbreaking/emotionally vulnerable" [...] and thought the [...] "baptismal effect" [...] of the video [...] "feels like a seamless transition from Rihanna's 'Diamonds' video." [...] Tamar Anitai also of MTV compared the video to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2004), writing that both videos [...] "are equal parts stunning and sobering, haunting and harrowing, and both feature impossibly famous singers reflecting upon damaged relationships while inviting us into their well-designed bathrooms as they vulnerably perform their ablutions." [...] Rihanna's [...] "Stay" [...] video was also compared to and said to be inspired by Janet Jackson's [...] "Every Time" [...] video, as well as Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] video, with one critic noting [...] "Rihanna isn't the first pop star to brood in a bathtub. Janet Jackson and Britney Spears also bared their emotion immersed in water. Janet bared all in a blue lagoon for her 'Every Time' video. A little less glam, Britney's tub scene in her 'Everytime' video proved dark foreshadowing into her troubled world." ...|$|E

It is true that other bills might be inclined to curl. He handed each one a decree of divorce. Each stood awkwardly silent, slowly folding the guarantee of freedom.

60|$|It {{was high}} noon at Tres Pinos. The three pines {{from which it}} gained its name, in the dusty road and hot air, seemed to smoke from their balsamic spires.

There was even a glare from the {{unpainted}} red-wood boards of Roscommon's grocery and tavern, and a tendency of the warping floor of the veranda <b>to</b> <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> beneath {{the feet of the}} intruder.
