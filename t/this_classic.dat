25|$|Historically, medical {{practitioners}} {{expected a}} person to present with three findings. <b>This</b> <b>classic</b> triad is 1: haematuria, which is when there is blood present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain {{on the side of}} the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger. It is now known that <b>this</b> <b>classic</b> triad of symptoms only occurs in 10–15% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage. Today, RCC is often asymptomatic (meaning few to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments.|$|E

25|$|The {{announcement}} of Apple's intention {{to switch to}} Intel-based Macs caused concern because Rosetta, the PowerPC dynamic translator, when first announced, emulated a G3 at only 60-80% of a similarly powered CPU's clock speed. Apart from <b>this,</b> <b>Classic,</b> the Mac OS 9 virtualization for Mac OS X, was not ported to the x86 architecture, leaving the new Intel-powered Macs incompatible with original Mac OS applications without a proper third-party PowerPC emulator.|$|E
25|$|Classical economics, {{developed}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, included a value theory and distribution theory. The value of a product was thought {{to depend on the}} costs involved in producing that product. The explanation of costs in Classical economics was simultaneously an explanation of distribution. A landlord received rent, workers received wages, and a capitalist tenant farmer received profits on their investment. <b>This</b> <b>classic</b> approach included the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.|$|E

Other principles such as Accountability have sometimes been proposed for addition—it has been pointed out that issues such as non-repudiation do not fit well within the three core concepts.|$|E
25|$|Cuvier's {{most admired}} work was his Le Règne Animal. It {{appeared}} in four octavo volumes in 1817; a second edition in five volumes was brought out in 1829–1830. In <b>this</b> <b>classic</b> work, Cuvier presented {{the results of}} his life's research into the structure of living and fossil animals. With the exception of the section on insects, in which he was assisted by his friend Latreille, the whole of the work was his own.

25|$|The Persian {{physician}} Abū ‘Alī al-Husayn ibn Sina ("Avicenna") described opium as {{the most}} powerful of the stupefacients, in comparison to mandrake and other highly effective herbs, in The Canon of Medicine. The text lists medicinal effects of opium, such as analgesia, hypnosis, antitussive effects, gastrointestinal effects, cognitive effects, respiratory depression, neuromuscular disturbances, and sexual dysfunction. It also refers to opium's potential as a poison. Avicenna describes several methods of delivery and recommendations for doses of the drug. <b>This</b> <b>classic</b> text was translated into Latin in 1175 and later into many other languages and remained authoritative until the 19th century. Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu used opium in the 14th-century Ottoman Empire to treat migraine headaches, sciatica, and other painful ailments.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} years, Liutprand entered into {{an alliance with}} the Exarch against the pope, without giving up the old one with the Pope against the Exarch; he crowned <b>this</b> <b>classic</b> double play with an offensive {{that led to the}} duchies of Spoleto and Benevento under his authority, eventually arriving to negotiate a peace between the pope and Exarch beneficial for the Lombards. No Lombard king had ever obtained similar results in wars with other powers in the Italian territory. In 732 his nephew Hildeprand, who succeeded him on the throne, briefly succeeded in taking possession of Ravenna, however he was driven away by the Venetians called shortly after the new pope, Gregory III.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Jefferson, {{principal}} {{author of}} the Declaration of Independence, was honored with a 5-cent stamp {{at the onset of}} the American Civil War. The stamp was used in combinations for postage to France and other foreign destinations. The National Bank Note company printed approximately 175,000 of <b>this</b> <b>Classic</b> Period stamp in several shades. The signing of the Declaration of Independence was commemorated with a 24-cent stamp in 1869. The stamp reproduces John Trumbull’s painting in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, in an image 1/300th the size of the original. The National Bank Note Company printed 235,350 stamps of this 24-cent issue. In the Second Continental Congress, George Washington was unanimously elected to lead the Continental Army besieging Boston. He personally commanded campaigns in the north.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic {{testing for}} OTC deficiency, or any {{individual}} with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis (to identify {{the presence or}} absence of orotic acid, as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased citrulline and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate <b>this</b> <b>classic</b> biochemical phenotype.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>classic</b> {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} positing a difference in male and female reproductive strategies has recently been reexamined, with an alternate theory being proposed that promiscuity was encouraged among women and men alike, causing uncertainty among males of the paternity of their offspring, allowing for group cooperation in raising all offspring due {{to the possibility that}} any child could be the descendant of a male, similar to observations of the closest relative of humans, the bonobo. Moreover, recent archaeological research done by the anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona suggests that the sexual division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 and 10,000 years ago) and developed relatively recently in human history. The sexual division of labor may have arisen to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently.|$|E
