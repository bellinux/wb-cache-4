The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%.

25|$|With {{the energy}} sector {{employing}} {{a huge number of}} Calgarians, the fallout from the economic slump of the early 1980s was significant, and the unemployment rate soared. By the end of the decade, however, the economy was in recovery. Calgary quickly realized that it could not afford to put so much emphasis on oil and gas, and the city has since become much more diverse, both economically and culturally. The period during <b>this</b> <b>recession</b> marked Calgary's transition from a mid-sized and relatively nondescript prairie city into a major cosmopolitan and diverse centre. This transition culminated in the city hosting Canada's first Winter Olympics in 1988. The success of these Games essentially put the city on the world stage.|$|E
25|$|The early 2000s {{recession}} was {{a decline}} in economic activity which mainly occurred in developed countries. The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States in 2002 and 2003. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation. Japan's 1990s recession continued. <b>This</b> <b>recession</b> was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) slowed {{in some parts of}} East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession in industrialized countries wasn't as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth.|$|E

[...] Beginning in 1930, the nation's busiest {{pipeline}} operator and massive integrated oil company, United Gas Corporation, was headquartered in Shreveport, until its hostile takeover by Pennzoil in 1968, and the subsequent forced merger. In the 1980s, {{the oil and gas industry}} suffered a large economic downturn, and many companies cut back jobs or went out of business, including a large retail shopping mall, South Park Mall, which closed in the late 1990s and is now Summer Grove Baptist Church. Shreveport suffered severely from <b>this</b> <b>recession,</b> and many residents left the area.|$|E

[...] A second, much more severe recession, sometimes labeled a depression, began in January 1920. Several indices {{of economic activity}} suggest {{the recession}} was moderately severe. The Axe-Houghton Index of Index of Trade and Industrial Activity declined by 14.1% in <b>this</b> <b>recession</b> (compared to a 31% decline in the Panic of 1907).

5000|$|Scholars view <b>this</b> <b>recession</b> more {{importantly}} as {{a representation of}} a larger structural shift from a Fordism economic production system underpinning many North American industries, toward one of Post-Fordism.

[...] However, due to rising global competition, energy crises, stagflation and recession, Fordism began to unravel. [...] Consequently, {{a new system of}} economic production, characterized by greater flexibility and the exploitation of economies of scope, known as Post-Fordism, began to emerge.|$|E
50|$|The world steel {{industry}} entered a crisis period during {{the end of}} the 1970s and early 1980s with the widespread recession, which occurred at that time.

A world oversupply situation occurred in the steel market with export prices falling to uneconomic levels.
