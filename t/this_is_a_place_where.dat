25|$|In mountainous areas (or near {{rivers in}} mountainous areas), the main {{aquifers}} are typically unconsolidated alluvium, composed of mostly horizontal layers of materials deposited by water processes (rivers and streams), which in cross-section (looking at a two-dimensional {{slice of the}} aquifer) appear to be layers of alternating coarse and fine materials. Coarse materials, {{because of the high}} energy needed to move them, tend to be found nearer the source (mountain fronts or rivers), whereas the fine-grained material will make it farther from the source (to the flatter parts of the basin or overbank areas—sometimes called the pressure area). Since there are less fine-grained deposits near the source, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> aquifers are often unconfined (sometimes called the forebay area), or in hydraulic communication with the land surface.|$|E
