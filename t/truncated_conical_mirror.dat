Compared with traditional approaches that employ a flat mirror, the conical mirror system has approximately 3 times better measurement sensitivity. By utilizing a fast switching filter wheel (switching time < 100 milliseconds), emission data at multiple wavelengths can be efficiently collected. An array of appropriately shaped neutral density filters, mounted on a linear stage, {{can be used to}} increase the system measurement dynamic range by 3 orders of magnitude. An x-y galvo mirror scanning system makes it possible to scan a collimated laser beam to any location on the mouse surface. A pattern of structured light incident on the animal surface is used to extract the surface geometry. A finite element based algorithm is applied to model photon propagation in the turbid media and a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is used to solve the large linear system matrix. The reconstruction algorithm and the system performance are evaluated by phantom experiments...|$|E

Circular scanning, of the beam projected onto the proximal face of the imaging bundle, produces a corresponding circular scan at the distal end of the bundle.

40|$|Injection nozzles (conical and {{cylindrical}} surface) and valve needles (conical sur-face) {{demand a}} fast and accurate {{measurement of the}} shape of the surface. Standard white-light interferometers are optimized to measure flat surfaces and cannot acquire the complete surface of cylindrical or conical object in one single measurement. We modified our white-light interferometer to measure in cylindrical coordinates. For cylindrical objects a 90 ° <b>conical</b> <b>mirror</b> is use d to illuminate and to observe the measured object. For conical objects the angle of the <b>conical</b> <b>mirror</b> has to be properly adapted. To measure the inner surface, specifically the conical end of the injector nozzle hole, a conical micro-mirror was developed. 1 Basic Principle The white-light interferometer (Coherence radar [1]) measures surfaces by scanning the temporal coherence function of the broadband light source. For each object point we record a correlogram. From the maximum of the correlogram the position of the corresponding object point along the z-axis can be found. Fig. 1 White-light interferometry – optimal for the meas-urement of a flat surface. The standard white-light interferometer is optimal for measuring flat surfaces (Fig. 1). To measure a conical or cylindrical surface we modified the illu-mination and observation in the object arm of the white-light interferometer [2]. With use of the proper <b>conical</b> <b>mirror</b> (Figs. 2 and 3) the illuminating rays are directed perpendicular to the measured surface. The <b>conical</b> <b>mirror</b> acts {{at the same time as}} an imaging device for the re-flected rays [3]. This scheme has a significant advantage:- incoming light is reflected directly back into the interferometer,- we are measuring the whole surface of the ob-ject in one single measurement...|$|R

40|$|In our {{previous}} studies {{a new type}} of grid-domed textile composite with high specific energy-absorbing capacity was developed. Each cell of the grid-domed textile composites consists of a hemispherical shell connected to a <b>truncated</b> <b>conical</b> wall (Configuration 1). In the present paper, a new cell configuration is examined, whose cell is a <b>truncated</b> <b>conical</b> shell only (Configuration 2). The grid-domed textile composite with Configuration 2 displays a higher energy-absorbing capacity, more stable deformation mode, lower peak force and almost constant magnitude of force during its large deformation process. The factors having an influence on the energy-absorbing capacity, which are investigated, include the cell height, the diameter ratio of cell-top to cell-bottom, conical wall area, cell density and the resin added-on percentage. The effective parameters to control the energy-absorbing capacity of the grid-domed textile composites are the semi-apical angle and the cell wall area. Increasing the cell density leads to the enhancement of the energy-absorbing capacity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Catadioptric omnidirectional sensors, consisting of a camera and a mirror, can track objects and estimate their distances more robustly.

A perspective projection unwarping of the <b>conical</b> <b>mirror</b> images is developed and demonstrated. This has hitherto been considered impossible for mirrors with multiple viewpoints.
