5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} lobes, {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes on either side of <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E
5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the rear floor of <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> is called the plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of only a tiny outgrowth on the floor of <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to the rear floor of <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to the navel and allow <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E

5|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Dry Hollow and <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Bunnell Run, {{the waters}} of Hammersley Fork are a Rosgen type F and a Rosgen type C stream.

The middle part of the stretch is a Rosgen type B stream and the lower part is a Rosgen type F to D stream.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores have no brain {{or central}} nervous system, but instead have a nerve net (rather like a cobweb) that forms a ring round <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> and is densest near {{structures}} such as the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles (if present) and the sensory complex furthest from <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> which may help to locate or funnel prey into <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

5|$|Europeans first sighted {{the area}} in 1770 when the crew of James Cook's Endeavour sailed along the coast. Cook named a bay in the Catlins area Molineux's Harbour after his ship's master Robert Molineux. Although this was almost {{certainly}} <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Waikawa River, later visitors applied the name to a bay to the northeast, close to <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Clutha River, which itself was for many years known as the Molyneux River.|$|E
5|$|Local {{trauma is}} also {{associated}} with aphthous stomatitis, and {{it is known that}} trauma can decrease the mucosal barrier.

5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} through <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> However, {{some long}} species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> would be difficult for them. The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E

5|$|Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) are collectively called lophophorates, {{because all}} feed using lophophores. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and {{morphological}} features placed lophophorates among or as a sister {{group to the}} deuterostomes, a super-phylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. In the early development of their embryos, deuterostomes form the anus before <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> while protostomes form <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> first.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mouth</b> is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> is closed.
