40|$|Abstract — UltraScienceNet is an {{experimental}} wide-area network testbed {{to enable the}} development of networking technologies required for the next-generation large-scale scientific applications. It provides on-demand, dedicated, high bandwidth channels for large data transfers, and also high resolution, high-precision channels for fine control operations. In the initial deployment, its data-plane consists of several thousand miles of dual 10 Gbps lambdas. The channels are provisioned on-demand using layer- 1 and layer- 2 switches in the backbone and multiple service provisioning platforms at the edges in a flexible configuration using a secure control-plane. A centralized scheduler is employed to compute the future channel allocations, and a signaling daemon is used to generate the configuration signals to switches at appropriate times. The control-plane is implemented using an out-of-band virtual private network, which encrypts the switching signals and also provides authenticated user and application access. Transport experiments are conducted on a smaller <b>test</b> <b>connection</b> which provided us useful information about the basic properties and issues of utilizing dedicated channels in applications.

The optical fiber cable is divided in 3 different segments called Cable A, Cable B and Cable C. Multi-fibers connectors assure precise connection among all optical fibers of the segments, providing flexibility for instrument changes. To assure strong and accurate connection, these sets are arranged inside two types of assemblies: the Tower Connector, for connection between Cable C and Cable B; and the Gang Connector, for connection between Cable B and Cable A. Throughput tests were made to evaluate the efficiency of the connections. A lifetime <b>test</b> <b>connection</b> is in progress. Cable C is installed inside the PFI, Prime Focus Instrument, where each fiber tip with a microlens is bonded {{to the end of the}} shaft of a 2 -stage piezo-electric rotatory motor positioner; this assembly allows each fiber to be placed anywhere within its patrol region, which is 9. 5 mm diameter [...] Each positioner uses a fiber arm to support the ferrule, the microlens, and the optical fiber. 2400 of these assemblies are arranged on a motor bench plate in a hexagonal-closed-packed disposition.

40|$|Abstract An attacker’s {{connection}} can propagate {{quickly to}} {{different parts of}} a transparent All-Optical Network. Such attacks affect the normal traffic and cause a quality of service degradation or outright service denial. Attack monitors can collect the information of each link and each node to help diagnose the attacker’s exact location. Quick detection and localization of an attack source helps avoid losing large amounts of data in an all-optical network. However, to detect attack sources, {{it is not necessary}} to put monitors on all nodes. Since not every wavelength on every link is being used all the time, we propose to use the idle wavelengths to setup diagnostic connections and obtain the necessary information needed for diagnosis purposes. We show that placing a relatively small number of monitors at some key nodes in a network is sufficient to achieve level of performance. However, the monitor placement policy, rout-ing policy, and diagnosis method are challenging problems. We, in this paper, first develop a monitor placement policy, a <b>test</b> <b>connection</b> policy, and a routing policy based on our definition of crosstalk attack and monitor node models. With these policies, we show that we can always detect and localize the malicious connections as long as there is no more than one malicious connection on each wavelength in the whole network. After this, we develop a scalable diagnosis method, which can localize the sources of the such malicious attacks in a fast manner...|$|E

40|$|An All-Optical Network (AON) is {{a network}} in which data does not undergo optical-to-electrical (O-E) or electrical-to-optical (E-O) {{conversion}} within the network. Although AONs are a viable technology for future telecommunication and data networks, little attentions {{has been devoted}} to the intrinsic differences between AONs and existing existing electro-optic/electronic networks in issues of security management. Without. O-E-O conversion, many security vulnerabilities that do not exist in traditional networks are created. Transparency and non-regeneration features make attack detection and localization difficult. However, it is important to detect and localize an attack connection quickly in a transparent AON;Among all attack methods, crosstalk attack has the highest damage capabilities. Therefore, we specifically focus on crosstalk attacks in this dissertation. We show {{that it is possible to}} effectively reduce the number of monitors while still retaining all diagnostic capabilities. We make the following contributions: (1) We provide a crosstalk attack model and a monitoring model. (2) Based on these models, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a both one attack and more than one (i. e., k-crosstalk) attack diagnostic network. The key ideas used in our solution are to employ the status of connections as diagnostic data.

These conditions lead to efficient k-attack detection and diagnosis algorithms.
