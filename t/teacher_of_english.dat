Teacher {{development is}} a much discussed topic in the current English language teaching professional literature. It {{is a concept that}} describes career long professional development which can be achieved in various ways. This study aimed to identify the attitudes <b>of</b> secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in Adana towards the existing options for teacher development and to investigate the feasibility of a school/university collaboration as a source for a new teacher development possibility. This study considered the following research questions: 1. What are the attitudes <b>of</b> secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> (SeSTE) in Adana towards teacher development? 2. In what ways do secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in Adana develop themselves? 3. What kinds of professional development sources do secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in Adana prefer? 4. Do secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in Adana support a school/university collaboration as a possibility for teacher development? 5. What characteristics of a school/university collaboration are the most appropriate for <b>teacher</b> development <b>of</b> secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in Adana? The sample of this study consisted of 106 secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and 12 administrators in Adana. Forty Private school teachers, 30 Anatolian school teachers, and 36 State school teachers were administered questionnaires. Twelve administrators (4 for each school type) were asked interview questions parallel to the questionnaire. Data gathered through questionnaires were analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, frequencies and percentages. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively through recurring themes. Results indicated that secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in Adana have positive attitude towards teacher development but the existing options as sources for teacher development are inadequate. General findings pointed to a school/university collaboration as one preferred option for <b>teacher</b> development <b>of</b> secondary school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in Adana and according to the results, guidelines for teacher development built on school/university collaboration were proposed and presented in the studyÇakır, EmineM.

25|$|Charles Bertram {{was born}} in London in 1723. He {{was the son of}} an English silk dyer who was usually {{accounted}} to have emigrated to Copenhagen, Denmark, among the retinue of Princess Louisa, a daughter of GeorgeII, upon her marriage to Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1743. (The prince became KingFrederickV three years later.) Other sources suggest the father immigrated earlier, in 1738. The father established himself as a hosier in 1744, and Charles seems to have benefited from the warm reception that Louisa and her retinue received from the Danes. On 5 July 1747, Charles petitioned the University of Copenhagen's Consortium for admission to study history, antiquities, philosophy, and mathematics. This seems to have been granted, although students were generally required to adhere to the Danish Church and Bertram remained Anglican. He became a friend and protégé of Hans Gram, the royal librarian {{and a member of the}} privy council. On 23 March 1748, Bertram petitioned the king to be permitted to give public lectures on the English language and became a <b>teacher</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in the Royal Marine Academy in Copenhagen. (Some accounts name him as a professor, rather than a tutor; if so, that status would have been granted some years later, as he was a new undergraduate in 1747.) His 1749 chrestomathy An Essay on the Excellency and Style of the English Tongue has been called the initiation of English-language printing in Denmark. A brother apparently died at sea in 1752, and at some point he married Cathrine Marie Gold.|$|E
