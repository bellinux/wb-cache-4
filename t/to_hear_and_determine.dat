60|$|I {{have caused}} to be {{communicated to the}} Government of the King of Italy the thanks of this Government for the eminent {{services}} rendered by Count Corti as the third commissioner on this commission.

The recent reference under the treaty of Washington was confined to claims of British subjects arising during the period named in the treaty; but it is understood {{that there are other}} British claims of a similar nature, arising after the 9th of April, 1865, and it is known that other claims of a like nature are advanced by citizens or subjects of other powers.

In this connection I renew my recommendation, made at the opening of the last session of Congress, that a special court be created <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>and</b> <b>determine</b> all claims of aliens against the United States arising from acts committed against their persons or property during the insurrection. It appears equitable that opportunity should be offered to citizens of other states to present their claims, as well as to those British subjects whose claims were not admissible under the late commission, to the early decision of some competent tribunal. To this end I recommend the necessary legislation to organize a court to dispose of all claims of aliens of the nature referred to in an equitable and satisfactory manner, and to relieve Congress and the Departments from the consideration of these questions.|$|E
60|$|These {{concessions}} were so {{just and}} reasonable, that, if we except the force, no prince could think himself wronged in making them.

And that force might not be wanting to execute the judgments of this new tribunal, the king agreed to issue his own writs to all persons, to oblige them to take an oath of obedience to the twenty-five barons, who were empowered to distress him by seizure of his lands and castles, and by every possible method, until the grievance complained of was redressed according to their pleasure: his own person and his family were alone exempted from violence.|$|E
40|$|An early {{detection}} of hearing loss in children {{is important for the}} child's speech and language development. For children between 3 - 6 months, a reliable method <b>to</b> measure <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>determine</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds is missing. A hearing test based on the pupillary response to auditory signal detection as measured by eye tracking is based on an automatic physiological response. This hearing test could be used instead of the objective hearing tests used today. The presence of pupillary response has been shown in response to speech, but it is unstudied in response to sinus tones. The objective of this thesis was to study whether there is a consistent pupillary response to different sinus tone frequencies commonly used in <b>hearing</b> tests <b>and</b> if yes, to determine reliably the time window of this response. Four different tests were done. The adult pupillary response in regard to sinus tone stimuli with four frequency levels (500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz), and four loudness levels (silence, 30 dB, 50 dB and 70 dB) was tested (N= 20, 15 females, 5 males). Different brightness levels and distractions on the eye tracking screen were investigated in three substudies (N= 5, 4 females, 1 male). Differences between silence and loudness levels within frequency levels were tested for statistical significance. A pupillary response in regard to sinus tones occurred consistently between 300 ms and 2000 ms with individual variation, i. e. earlier than for speech sounds. Differences between silence and loudness levels were only statistically significant for 4000 Hz. No statistical difference was shown between different brightness levels or if there were distractions present on the eye tracker screen. The conclusion is that pupillary response to pure sinus tones in adults is a possible measure of hearing threshold for at least 4000 Hz. Larger studies are needed to confirm this, and also to more thoroughly investigate the other frequencies.  En tidig upptäckt av hörselnedsättning hos barn är viktig för barnets tal- och språkutveckling. För barn mellan 3 - 6 månader saknas det en tillförlitlig metod för att mäta hörsel och bestämma hörtrösklar. Ett hörseltest baserad på pupillreaktion på ljud som mäts med en eye tracker bygger på en automatisk fysiologisk reaktion och skulle kunna användas istället för de objektiva test som används idag. Hitintills har pupillreaktion på tal påvisats, men det saknas studier som studerat eventuella reaktioner på sinustoner. Syftet med denna uppsats var att undersöka om det finns en enhetlig pupillreaktion på de olika frekvenserna av sinustoner som vanligen används i hörseltest. Vidare var studiens syfte att fastställa ett tillförlitligt tidsfönster för pupillreaktion. Fyra olika typer av tester utfördes. Pupillreaktionen mot sinustoner med fyra olika frekvensnivåer (500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz och 4000 Hz), och fyra olika ljudnivåer (tystnad, 30 dB, 50 dB och 70 dB) undersöktes i ett test på vuxna deltagare (N= 20, 15 kvinnor, 5 män). Olika ljusnivåer och distraktioner på eye tracker-skärmen undersöktes i tre test (N= 5, 4 kvinnor, 1 man). Skillnaderna mellan ljudnivåer och frekvensnivåer testades med statistiska tester. Resultaten visade att pupillreaktion på sinustoner inträffade konsekvent mellan 300 ms och 2000 ms med individuella variationer. Denna reaktionstid inträffar tidigare än för taljud. En statistisk signifikant skillnad mellan tystnad och olika ljudnivåer kunde endast ses för frekvensnivån 4000 Hz. Ingen statistisk skillnad uppmättes mellan olika ljudnivåer eller om det fanns distraktioner på eye tracker-skärmen. De i studien framkomna resultaten tyder på att pupillreaktioner mot rena sinustoner hos vuxna är en möjlig metod för att identifiera hörseltrösklar för åtminstone 4000 Hz. Större studier behöver göras för att fastställa detta och en noggrannare undersökning behöver genomföras för de andra frekvenserna. ...|$|R
