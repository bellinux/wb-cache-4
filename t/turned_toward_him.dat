60|$|Angela <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> quickly, {{smiling and}} {{frowning}} at once.|$|E
60|$|The girl <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> {{the laugh}} still playing on her lips.|$|E
60|$|As Maxwell <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> the {{smoldering}} fire was plainer in his eye.|$|E
6000|$|He seats {{himself by}} her side, and feasts {{his eyes on}} the lovely downcast face that dares not <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him.</b> He whispers to her: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I AM the King," [...] said Edward, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "as {{thou shalt}} know to thy cost, in good time. Thou hast confessed a murder--thou shalt swing for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{tried to}} look at Winterfield, but her eyes sank. She could <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> and that was all. [...] "Is it the sea-piece in the study?" [...] {{she said to him}} faintly.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> and the {{moonlight}} showed {{her face was}} reassuringly quiet.|$|E
60|$|The {{telegraph}} instrument {{began to}} click just then and the agent <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> sharply.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> {{watching}} his face. [...] "Early Tudor? How very delightful! And I suppose {{there are a}} great many others." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} took it, {{and drew}} from it such music as made all heads <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> at once. Then {{he began to}} sing, sometimes by himself, and sometimes his comrades, [...] "more Girviorum tripliciter canentes" [...] joined their voices in a three-man-glee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{my mother}} comes," [...] said Gwendolen. [...] "Ah! I must be changed. I have not looked at myself. Should you have known me," [...] she added, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "if you had met me now?--should you have known {{me for the}} one you saw at Leubronn?" ...|$|R
60|$|He fanned the fainting {{flame of}} her life; by-and-by she <b>turned</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Anderssen shuddered. Then Tarzan <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him.</b> His {{face was}} cold and cruel, and in the grey eyes the Swede read murder.|$|E
60|$|Now when Eglinton <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> he at once {{recognised}} {{the handsome}} face, and those kind eyes, which always looked grave and perfectly straight at an interlocutor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I perceive," [...] I said calmly. [...] "It's the {{unfettered}} impulse of a lofty soul {{breaking the}} tyrannizing bonds of custom." [...] And I <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{continued}} to stand motionless, watching the Austrian soldier. Should the fellow <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> he had but to withdraw his head within {{the shadow of}} the building that hid his body. Possibly the man might turn and take his beat in the opposite direction. In which case Barney was sure he could dodge across the street, undetected.|$|R
60|$|Whether {{she heard}} or not, {{he could not}} say; certain it is that she made no reply, nor did she <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> at all. The light of the lanthorn lit up her {{delicate}} profile, pale and drawn, her tightly pressed lips, the look of utter contempt in her eyes, which even the fitful shadow cast by her hair over her brows could not altogether conceal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I have him!" [...] he {{must have}} said to himself, as the Captain would <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> in his walk; [...] "now's my time!" [...] and up would go {{his hand to his}} cap; but, alas! the Captain was off again; and the men at the guns would cast sly winks at each other as the embarrassed Lieutenant would bite his lips with {{suppressed}} vexation.|$|R
60|$|The broad, muscular {{back was}} <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> but, tanned though it was, D'Arnot {{saw that it}} was the back of a white man, and he thanked God.|$|E
6000|$|The woman <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him.</b> He saw {{her eyes}} shine through her veil. She bared {{her hand and}} {{extended}} it toward him. [...] "I hope you and Estelle will be happy." ...|$|E
60|$|A truly wise paragraph. Pity {{it was not}} expounded. God {{will accept}} our imperfections, where their face is <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> {{on the road to}} the glorious liberty of the Gospel.|$|E
60|$|Without <b>turning</b> {{her head}} <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> Eleanor {{addressed}} Trowse.|$|R
60|$|A man {{passed them}} from behind, walking quicker than they did. As he passed, {{he looked at}} them both intently, as if desirous of arresting their attention. Of course he succeeded, for his look was almost compelling. Louisa {{was the first to}} <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> then Luke did likewise: and the passer-by raised his hat respectfully with a slight {{inclination}} of head and shoulders that suggested foreign upbringing.|$|R
6000|$|Gareth awhile lingered. The mother's eye [...] Full of the wistful {{fear that}} he would go, [...] And <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> wheresoe'er he <b>turned,</b> [...] Perplext his outward purpose, till an hour, [...] When wakened by the wind which with full voice [...] Swept bellowing through the {{darkness}} on to dawn, [...] He rose, and out of slumber calling two [...] That still had tended on him from his birth, [...] Before the wakeful mother heard him, went.|$|R
60|$|Blanche <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> with {{a wondrous}} look--a look {{which made him}} shiver with emotion. He looked down a moment, and his {{struggle}} to speak made him seem very boyish and gentle.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{round at}} the crowd of faces, {{all of which were}} now <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> kindly faces and angry ones, contemptuous eyes and good-natured ones, and some that {{expressed}} both compassion and reproof.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meriem!" [...] he shouted, {{starting}} toward her; {{but one of}} his guards grasped his arm {{and jerked}} him back. The girl leaped to her feet and <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> as she heard her name.|$|E
60|$|Morgan le Fay rippled {{along as}} musically as ever. Marvelous woman. And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people {{do when the}} {{lightning}} flashes out of a cloud. I could have got the habit myself. It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he {{was always on the}} ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> but he winced.|$|R
6000|$|... "Girl!... I'm hungry--for you!" [...] he breathed, hoarsely. And <b>turning</b> her <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> {{he embraced}} her, {{as if his}} nature was savage {{and he had to}} use a savage force.|$|R
60|$|She slowly <b>turned</b> {{her head}} <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> and a faint sigh escaped her.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> for {{the first}} time. In her new position, she was clearly visible in the light. He looked at her attentively. [...] "I have seen you somewhere," [...] he said, [...] "before now." ...|$|E
60|$|Elsie <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> {{and he saw}} the strange, elusive {{tenderness}} {{shining in}} her eyes. Momentary as it was, it transformed her face, and he wondered whether she approved his sentiment or knew whom he meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me see," [...] said Hans. Mirah in her childlike way <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> to {{be looked}} at; and he, going to a little further distance, knelt with one knee on a hassock to survey her.|$|E
2500|$|Believing U-505 to {{be seriously}} damaged, Oblt.z.S. Lange ordered his crew to abandon ship. This order was obeyed so {{promptly}} that scuttling was not completed, (although some valves were opened) and the engines were left running. With the engines still functioning and the rudder damaged by depth charges, U-505 circled clockwise at approximately [...] Seeing the U-boat <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>him</b> and believing she {{was preparing to}} attack, the commanding officer of Chatelain ordered a single torpedo to be fired at the submarine; the torpedo missed, passing ahead of the now-abandoned U-505.|$|R
60|$|As Tarzan approached, {{the beast}} <b>turned,</b> snarling, <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> {{struggling}} to extricate itself; but one great limb across its {{back and the}} smaller entangling branches pinioning its legs prevented it from moving but a few inches in any direction.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> {{slightly}} <b>toward</b> <b>him,</b> and saw {{him standing}} there, looking very fixedly at her, with a gaze which had something of entreaty in it, and also an unexplainable subtle something which at first she could not quite understand.|$|R
