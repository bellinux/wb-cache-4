[...] This case involved a couple with assets exceeding £4.5m which was deemed more than either needs for their reasonable requirements. It was held {{that the absence of}} financial need did not mean departing from a more generous settlement for an applicant in big money cases. This, therefore, enables the courts to make settlements reflecting the wealth of the parties, and not just <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements.</b> However, it seems clear from Lord Nicholls' leading speech that he intended much of what he said to apply to all ancillary relief cases, and not just big money ones. Lord Nicholls said that in all cases, regardless of division of assets, a judge would always be well advised to check his tentative views (on distribution of assets) against the [...] "yardstick of equality of division". This was not to introduce a presumption of equality in all cases, but [...] "to ensure the absence of discrimination", for instance, between a wage earner, and a child-carer, thereby recognising the non-financial contribution of the parent caring for children.|$|E

The present paper also answers the question that how society democratically and effectively access to Web 2. 0 technologies for spatial information and translate the virtually tested, analyzed design in the real world. In overall, the paper tries to frame a concept to use Web 2. 0 technologies {{as a tool for}} establishing Intelligent Transportation System within the existing land-use system. No doubt Web 2. 0 technologies in the cybernetic age is the fastest way to access, collect, analyze and transfer spatial information and providing innovative, sustainable, participatory solutions for effective government and community empowerment. However, the use of Web 2. 0 technologies in transportation system is not the part of smart city model in India. Hence, the paper will act as a guiding principle and methodology for Smart City Mission in India. The paper also suggests the possible ways to establish Web 2. 0 technologies applications for intelligent transport system through community base local Neighbourhood Digital Technology Center (NDTC). The establishment of NDTC will give local urban community free hand to tailored or customized Web 2. 0 software as per <b>their</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>and</b> generate or manipulate their own information or spatial data rather than given answer or raised query to the predefined proposed land-use map...|$|R

In order to execute the project logically, it has been divided into four logical stages focusing on tasks – market scanning for the potential candidate based on Sierra Atlantic’s acquisition criteria, ranking the companies based on scoring, choosing the top 3 companies for financial evaluation, performing non-financial evaluation including synergy and barriers. The acquisition criteria or the filter parameters for scanning the UK is provided by Sierra Atlantic based on their acquisition strategy and firm <b>and</b> corporate level <b>requirements.</b> Even the ranking system adopted is also suggested by Sierra Atlantic. As part of the financial evaluation discounted cash flow and comparable methods are adopted, as per Sierra Atlantic request, to estimate the firm value of the target companies. For both methods, scenario analyses of different cases are applied in order to estimate the true value of target firms. Lastly, a brief analysis of synergy and potential barriers acquisitions are identified.

Consumers generally do not make <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> explicit and then subsequently go in search of products to fulfill them. Neither do they think up novel products themselves. Instead, our thesis is that consumers are aware of which products others around them are using and they select what they want from this assortment presented to them. Firms often do not take this social process in account in their new product development activities, preferring to focus on the practicalities such as product functionality and design. ...|$|E
