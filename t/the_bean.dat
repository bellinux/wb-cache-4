5|$|Prepared dried bean flakes {{can also}} be used in the dish's preparation. <b>The</b> <b>bean</b> flakes are reconstituted into a bean paste using boiling water, and can be used to create an instant or quick bean dip. The use of dried bean flakes can {{contribute}} to a bean dip with a creamy and smooth texture.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{wash the}} beans {{several times to}} remove {{the remains of the}} skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry. Cooperative employees turn the beans regularly as technicians spot and remove bad beans. A longer drying process of up to two weeks in the sun follows (with provision for quick covering in the event of rain), again with constant turning. This last process reduces the water content of <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> from 40 percent to 12 percent.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} {{must be to}} take the goose across the river, as any other {{will result in the}} goose or <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> being eaten. When the farmer returns to the {{original}} side, he has the choice of taking either the fox or <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> across next. If he takes the fox across, he would have to return to get <b>the</b> <b>beans,</b> resulting in <b>the</b> fox eating the goose. If he takes <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> across second, he will need to return to get the fox, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> being eaten by the goose. The dilemma is solved by taking the fox (or <b>the</b> <b>beans)</b> over and bringing the goose back. Now he can take <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> (or <b>the</b> fox) over, and finally return to fetch the goose.|$|R

50|$|As {{with many}} <b>beans,</b> <b>the</b> fasolia gigandes turn out better if soaked {{overnight}} in cold water. Then <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are boiled until tender and drained, {{and the rest}} of ingredients are added. The aromatics are sautéed to make a sofrito and mixed with <b>the</b> <b>beans.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are baked until the top layer of the dish is browned. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are garnished with parsley and Greek feta, and served with bread.|$|R

25|$|In 1687, van Leeuwenhoek {{reported}} {{his research}} on the coffee bean. He roasted <b>the</b> <b>bean,</b> cut it into slices and saw a spongeous interior. <b>The</b> <b>bean</b> was pressed, and an oil appeared. He boiled the coffee with rain water twice and set it aside.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{roasting}} {{begins when}} the temperature inside <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> reaches approximately , though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of <b>the</b> <b>bean.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> common <b>bean</b> is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species that {{has a long history}} of cultivation. All wild members of the species have a climbing habit, but many cultivars are classified as [...] "bush beans" [...] or [...] "pole beans", depending on their style of growth. These include <b>the</b> kidney <b>bean,</b> <b>the</b> navy <b>bean,</b> <b>the</b> pinto <b>bean,</b> and <b>the</b> wax <b>bean.</b> <b>The</b> other major types of commercially grown <b>bean</b> are <b>the</b> runner <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus coccineus) and <b>the</b> broad <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba).|$|R
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{then move}} <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> to <b>the</b> technical centre in nearby Kizi. Certain machines, {{housed in a}} warehouse {{up the side of}} the hill, remove the parchment skins from <b>the</b> <b>beans.</b> Employees take <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> into <b>the</b> adjacent laboratory for the final quality control process – hand sorting – which is carried out by several experienced women. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are bagged and labeled according to their quality, and stored in the compound's warehouse to await sale.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{cherries}} are {{put through}} the pulper and the seeds have been soaked, they are {{set out to}} sun-dry {{for a period of}} one week. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are periodically raked to ensure even drying. Once dried, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> will form a thin, paper-like shell called parchment. Once formed, the parchment will increase the beans’ storage life considerably. When <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are ready, <b>the</b> parchment is removed, and <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are graded and sorted according size, weight and defects. <b>The</b> sorted <b>beans</b> are then stored in 60 or 70 kg sacks called sisal bags that help <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> retain moisture {{for a longer period of}} time. [...] The storage time cannot exceed one year for <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> to be considered a current crop. If the green coffee remains in storage for longer than a year, it is considered old crop, and is less valuable because of its drier state.|$|R

25|$|Coffee plants grow {{within a}} defined {{area between the}} Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> belt or coffee belt.|$|E
25|$|In general, dark-roast coffee {{has very}} {{slightly}} less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> {{by a small}} amount.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Keller found <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> at a farmer's {{market in}} Yountville, California, and now uses <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> in his French Laundry and Per Se restaurants.|$|R
50|$|When {{fermentation}} is complete, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are washed thoroughly {{to remove}} fermentation residues and any remaining mucilage. If not removed, these cause decolouring of the parchment and make <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> susceptible to yeasts. After washing, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are dried. When the drying {{process is not}} rapid enough earthy and musty taints, like Rio-flavor come up.|$|R
50|$|Fluid bed or hot-air roasters force {{heated air}} through a screen or {{perforated}} plate under <b>the</b> coffee <b>beans</b> with sufficient force to lift <b>the</b> <b>beans.</b> Heat {{is transferred to}} <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> as they tumble and circulate within this fluidized bed.|$|R
25|$|It eats {{away the}} inside of <b>the</b> <b>bean,</b> making a hollow for itself. If the seed is cut, the larva will repair the hole with silk.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in the process is the {{roasting}} of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. <b>The</b> <b>bean</b> decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.|$|E

25|$|Preparing {{broad beans}} {{involves}} first removing <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> from their pods, then steaming or boiling <b>the</b> <b>beans,</b> either whole or after parboiling them to loosen their exterior coating, {{which is then}} removed.|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> out in <b>the</b> sun from five to seven days.|$|R
5000|$|Within 24 {{hours of}} picking, the cherry is {{run through a}} pulper. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are {{separated}} from the pulp and then placed overnight in a fermentation tank. The fermentation time is about 12 hours at low elevation or 24 at higher elevation. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are rinsed and spread to dry on a hoshidana or drying rack. Traditional hoshidanas have a rolling roof to cover <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> in rain. It takes seven to 14 days to dry beans to an optimal moisture level of between 10 and 13% (by Hawaii Department of Agriculture regulations: 9.0-12.0%). Too much moisture content in coffee allows the growth of ochratoxin A, a harmful mycotoxin, hazardous to human health. From here, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are stored as [...] "pergamino" [...] or parchment. The parchment is milled off <b>the</b> green <b>bean</b> prior to roasting or wholesale.|$|R
25|$|Bean leaves {{have been}} used {{historically}} to trap bedbugs in houses in Eastern Europe. The trichomes on <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> leaves capture the insects by impaling the feet (tarsi) of the insects. The leaves are then destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{future price}} of cocoa butter and cocoa powder is {{determined}} by multiplying <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> price by a ratio. The combined butter and powder ratio has tended to be around 3.5. If the combined ratio falls below 3.2 or so, production ceases to be economically viable and some factories cease extraction of butter and powder and trade exclusively in cocoa liquor.|$|E

50|$|Green {{coffee beans}} are soaked {{in a hot}} water/coffee {{solution}} to draw the caffeine {{to the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>beans.</b> Next, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are transferred to another container and immersed in coffee oils that were obtained from spent coffee grounds and left to soak.|$|R
50|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} into the Tanzanian region from modern day Ethiopia in the 16th century. Coffee was not really brewed in the region but {{was used as a}} stimulant. Through oral sources in the region the Haya tribe located in northwest Tanzania in modern-day Kagera region was the only recorded tribe that used <b>the</b> <b>beans.</b> <b>The</b> tribe boiled <b>the</b> Robusta <b>beans</b> and steamed them with various herbs and chewed on the mixture as a stimulant. The tribe also used <b>the</b> coffee <b>beans</b> as a form of currency and the growing and cultivating of <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> were highly controlled by tribal leaders.|$|R
50|$|In {{chocolate}} making, the Broma process (not to {{be confused}} with the Dutch Process), is a method of extracting white cocoa butter from roasted cocoa <b>beans.</b> <b>The</b> Broma process consists of hanging bags of roasted cocoa beans in a very warm room and allowing the cocoa butter, which melts at slightly above room temperature, to melt, drip off <b>the</b> <b>beans,</b> and be collected. The Dutch Process differs from the Broma process in that, after the cocoa butter has been drained off <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> as described above, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are then soaked in an alkaline solution to make them chemically neutral.|$|R
25|$|Back in Storybrooke, Fiona, {{convinced}} that she has succeeded, brings {{what was left of}} the book to Henry and gloats that Emma has lost her faith, though Henry refuses to accept this. Emma leaves Storybrooke to return to Boston. When she gets home, she discovers that Henry left her a hand-drawn storybook in order to make her remember their past. Meanwhile, as the realms are starting to collapse, and the Darkness approaches, David and Hook escape the dragon, but while climbing down the beanstalk, they lose their balance and fall. Regina and the Evil Queen discover that <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> had withered and lost its magic, because Fiona's Curse has caused Emma's lack of faith to drain the magic from the realm. Snow finds Hook alright, and she tells him to take <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> to the castle without her. When Snow finds an unconscious David, she kisses him and when he wakes, he tells her that Darkness never wins. As they rush to the castle, the storm of Dark Magic accelerates towards them.|$|E

50|$|According to taste, {{the bacon}} is placed either in {{complete}} strips or cut up into water {{which is then}} brought to the boil. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are cleaned, washed and cut into sections. After 25 minutes of cooking, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are added together with the savory to the bacon and cooking continues.The flowers are removed from the pears, but the stalks are left on. The pears are left with their skins on throughout. They are then laid on <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> and everything is cooked together.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>beans</b> {{may also}} be roasted on the stove top. One classic method is to use open-top {{cookware}} such as a cast-iron skillet, a frying pan, or a wok, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> constantly stirred to obtain an even degree of roasting. Another option {{is to use a}} stove-top popcorn maker such as a [...] "Whirley Pop" [...] or similar device with an integral crank and internal agitator system to keep <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> in motion as they roast. Constant cranking or stirring is required, as is plenty of ventilation.|$|R
