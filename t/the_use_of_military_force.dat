5|$|In late 2002 {{and early}} 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi {{disarmament}} mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four {{days prior to}} the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. The court should abstain from interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E

40|$|A {{bilateral}} military co-operation between Norway and Sweden {{has essentially}} required handling security challenges and rising costs. In addition, during recent {{years it has}} been revealed that cooperation with other nations is a prerequisite to obtain operational influence in multinational operations. These operations have required military forces {{with a high level}} of interoperability, to get the necessary fighting power. The aim of this study is to describe each country’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> forces, and then compare them. It is also to present an unbiased assessment of what kind of implications co-operation between Norway and Sweden may have on military interoperability. To achieve this intention, I have chosen to focus on contemporary military strategic and operational doctrines in Norway and Sweden by addressing the following questions: - What is the Norwegian understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> forces? - What is the Swedish understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> forces? - What kind of differences and similarities exist between the Norwegian and Swedish understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> forces? <b>The</b> analysis indicated both similarities and differences between the Norwegian and Swedish understanding. I have focused on the differences. As basic tools in this study I have <b>used</b> NATO`s classification <b>of</b> interoperability and British reflections on what shapes an effective fighting power. The study has discovered that the two countries` understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> forces does not form an acceptable basis for their military forces to be interoperable. Through different <b>use</b> <b>of</b> definitions and theories, implications are revealed as to <b>the</b> development and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> forces, e. g. lack of common doctrines. These implications will reduce the general understanding which is necessary in a military co-operation. In its turn this may reduce the core interoperability. The study shows that if military co-operation is to be useful, it is important to have a common understanding of the doctrines that constitute the basis for military co-operation...|$|R

25|$|The first Christian {{ruler of}} territories later called Poland, Mieszko I is {{considered}} the de facto creator of the Polish state. He continued the policy of both his father and grandfather, who were rulers of the pagan tribes located {{in the area of}} present-day Greater Poland. Through both alliances and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force,</b> Mieszko extended ongoing Polish conquests and early in his reign subjugated Kuyavia and probably Gdańsk Pomerania and Masovia. For most of his reign, Mieszko I was involved in warfare for the control of Western Pomerania, eventually conquering it up to the vicinity of the lower Oder river. During the last years of his life, he fought the Bohemian state, winning Silesia and probably Lesser Poland.|$|E

25|$|The PRC has {{consistently}} claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC {{is no longer}} in legitimate existence. Under its One-China Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence, though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal. The PRC has threatened <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible.|$|E
25|$|By July, the {{operation}} still showed little progress. Phase I of Operation Mongoose {{drew to a}} close. The Special Group provided plans on March 14, 1962 for {{the first phase of}} {{the operation}} until the end of July 1962. There were four main objectives for Phase 1, a. was to gather hard intelligence on the target area, b. undertake all other political, economic, and covert actions short of creating a revolt in Cuba or the need for U.S. armed intervention, c. be consistent with U.S. overt policy and be in the position to pull away with minimum loss of assets in U.S. prestige, d. Continue JCS planning and essential preliminary actions for a decisive U.S. capability for intervention. During Phase I the Punta del Este conference was a major U.S. political action to isolate Castro and neutralize his influence in the Hemisphere. President Kennedy's successful visit to Mexico was another major U.S. political action with an impact upon the operation but was not directly tied to the operation. Two political operations were performed in Phase I: counter Castro-Communist propaganda exploitation of May Day and to arouse strong Hemisphere reaction to Cuban military suppression of the hunger demonstration at Cardenas in June. Another key interest for Operation Mongoose was the Cuban refugees as it was thought they wanted to overthrow the Communist regime in Havana and recapturing their homeland. The refugees wee given open U.S. assistance to remain in this country yet are involved in covert actions in a limited way. Policy limitations of audibility and visibility were taken into consideration for the handling and use of the refugee potential. As Phase 1 drew to a close Phase II projected plan was written up and considered four possibilities. The first one was to cancel operational plans and treat Cuba as a Bloc nation and protect Hemisphere from it. The next possibility was to exert all possible diplomatic, economic, psychological, and other pressures to overthrow the Castro-Communist regime without overt employment of U.S. military. Another possibility was to help the Cubans overthrow the Castro-Communist regime with a step-by-step phase to ensure success including <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> if required. The last possibility was to use a provacation and overthrow the Castro-Communist regime by U.S. military force. In his July review, Lansdale recommended a more aggressive plan of action in the near future. He believed that time was of the essence, especially with the intensified Soviet military build-up in Cuba at the time. New plans to recruit more Cubans to infiltrate the Castro regime, interrupt Cuban radio and television broadcasts, and the deployment of commando sabotage units were drawn up.|$|E
