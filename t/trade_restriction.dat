25|$|The 1820 Battle of Cepeda, fought {{between the}} Centralists and the Federalists, {{resulted}} {{in the end of}} the Supreme Director rule. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another centralist constitution, with Bernardino Rivadavia being appointed as the first president of the country. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution. Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the Argentine Confederation in 1831, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. During his regime he faced a French blockade (1838–1840), the War of the Confederation (1836–1839), and a combined Anglo-French blockade (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory. His <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 Justo José de Urquiza, another powerful caudillo, beat him out of power. As new president of the Confederation, Urquiza enacted the liberal and federal 1853 Constitution. Buenos Aires seceded but was forced back into the Confederation after being defeated in the 1859 Battle of Cepeda.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> on corporate risk-taking. Using a cross-country sample of 38 countries over the 1990 to 2003 period, we find that corporate risk-taking is positively related to insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions.</b> This finding is robust to alternative regression specifications and sample periods, {{to the use of}} alternative measures of insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> and risk-taking incentives, and to controls for possible endogeneity. Further investigation suggests that the relation between insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> and corporate risk-taking is influenced by cross-sectional differences in stock market development and legal origin, and that the increase in risk-taking is beneficial to firms. In conclusion, this paper highlights the role of insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> as an important determinant of corporate risk-taking...|$|R

Intermediate goods invented elsewhere are only introduced on the LDC market if it is profitable to do so. The LDC economy evolves to a balanced growth path in which income, welfare, and the share of available goods increase if <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> fall. The adjustment path is asymmetric: an increase in <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> leads to a slow-down of economic growth, while a decrease {{may lead to a}} rapid catch-up process.

5000|$|A <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> is an {{artificial}} restriction {{on the trade}} of goods and/or services between two countries. It is the byproduct of protectionism. However, the term is controversial because what one part may see as a <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> another may see {{as a way to}} protect consumers from inferior, harmful or dangerous products. For instance Germany required the production of beer to adhere to its purity law. The law, originally implemented in Bavaria in 1516 and eventually becoming law for newly unified Germany in 1871, made many foreign beers unable to be sold in Germany as [...] "beer". This law was struck down in 1987 by the European Court of Justice, but is still voluntarily followed by many German breweries.|$|E

In these cases, one cannot define which country has comparative advantage.|$|E

5000|$|America's {{declaration}} of war, in mid-June 1812, was followed shortly by the Enemy Trade Act of 1812 on July 6, which employed similar restrictions as previous legislation; it was likewise ineffective and tightened in December 1813, and debated for further tightening in December 1814. After existing embargoes expired {{with the onset}} of war, the Embargo Act of 1813 was signed into law December 17, 1813. Four new restrictions were included: An embargo prohibiting all American ships and goods from leaving port; a complete ban on certain commodities customarily produced in the British Empire; a ban against foreign ships trading in American ports unless 75% of the crew were citizens of the ship's flag; and a ban on ransoming ships. The Embargo of 1813 was the nation's last great <b>trade</b> <b>restriction.</b> Never again would the US government cut off all its trade to achieve a foreign policy objective. [...] The act particularly hurt the northeastern states, since the British kept a tighter blockade on the south, and thus encouraged American opposition to the administration. To make his point, the act was not lifted by Madison until after the defeat of Napoleon, and the point was moot. On February 15, 1815, Madison signed the Enemy Trade Act of 1815; it was tighter than any previous <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> including the Enforcement Act of 1809 (January 9) and the Embargo of 1813, but it would expire two weeks later when official word of peace from Ghent was received.|$|E

5000|$|Encouraged by {{the example}} of the United States of America, which had won its {{independence}} from Britain, the attempt centred in the colonial province of Minas Gerais took place in 1789 to achieve the same objective. However, the Inconfidência Mineira failed, the leaders arrested and, of the participants of the insurrections the one of lowest social position, Tiradentes, was hanged. Among the conspiracies led by the Afro- population was the Bahian revolt in 1798, led primarily by Joao de Deus do Nascimento.

Impoverished social conditions and a high cost of living were among reasons of the revolt. Authorities diffused the plot before major action began; they executed four of the conspirators and exiled several others were exiled to the Atlantic Coast of Africa.

5000|$|Haji's faction {{gained the}} upper hand in May 1680, just as Ageng had Batavia {{surrounded}} and was declaring war on the Dutch. His father had a decade earlier withdrawn to a residence outside Banten proper, but Haji led a coup and confined Ageng to his residence outside the city. His position was weak, however, because he lacked the support of the Muslim elite, who remained loyal to his father, and who resented his overtures to the Dutch. He turned to the VOC for help, but they were unwilling to help unless he agreed to certain conditions: that escaping slaves and deserters be returned to Batavia even if they converted to Islam, that [...] "pirates" [...] be punished and the VOC compensated for their attacks, that Cirebon (on the opposite side of Batavia from Banten) be yielded, that there be no more interference in the relations of Batavia and the Mataram Sultanate, and that other Europeans be excluded trade with Banten.

5000|$|Mexico {{brings the}} {{complaint}} through GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) dispute resolution system utilizing the WTO committee {{arguing that the}} US MMPA product ban on tuna imports was inconsistent with the provisions of GATT. Mexico argues through WTO panel dispute resolution mechanism that the import prohibition was inconsistent with Article XI, Article XIII, Article III of GATT. Mexico also claimed that the embargo {{did not meet the}} exceptions of Article XX. Article III refers to the National treatment provision and the fact that countries must apply tariffs equally to similar products of all other contracting parties. This also brings to debate the Product vs. process debate. Also known as PPM's (Process and Production Methods), referring to desire of some countries to regulate international trade on like for like goods {{on the basis of their}} process technologies or harvesting techniques in this case. Although the intention of the embargo is to bring to light the externalities of dolphin casualties due to the purse-seine harvesting techniques, the issue of PPMs is that the process is irrelevant if the product is the same. Developing countries have historically been wary of including PPM's in the WTO. The fear being that this will create an imposition of environmental, technological and other qualitative standards with high thresholds set by industrialized countries thus creating a technical disadvantage for developing countries. Essentially what Mexico argues is that MMPA is discriminating against like products based on their production methods. Article XI addresses the quantitative restriction provision which involves the dispute over embargoes vs. tariffs. Article XI says that a country is permitted to impose tariffs as a <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> but prohibits any type of non-tariff restriction such as quotas or limiting importing/ exporting licenses. Further, Mexico argues the Article XX provision of GATT is inconsistent with that of the MMPA. Specifically Article XX(b) and XX(g) which refer to the allowance of trade restrictions when it is deemed [...] "necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health" [...] or [...] "relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources". The issue with Article XX is that even while it may be valid, it cannot be applied outside the jurisdiction of the United States, hence making the argument in the favor of Mexico. The outcome of this challenge fell in the favor of Mexico however these findings were not adopted formally due to the upcoming NAFTA negotiations, however the argument was revisited in the Dolphin Tuna II case in 1992.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the trade restrictions on steel imports {{in order to protect the}} US steel industry. During the period of 1963 to 1988, the industry experienced a tremendous decline in its output. Trade restrictions are implemented to limit steel imports. The overall goal of this study is to estimate {{the impact of the}} steel <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> regimes on the output of the industry. Beside foreign competition, the study addresses the impact of other factors - other shipments (nonsteel shipments) and the prices of steel substitutes - aluminum, and plastic and rubber that may have also caused variation in steel production. The study makes two major contributions. First, the study constructs the <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> regimes and other high-frequency monthly data set on steel output and factor prices. Second, output is modelled as a function of the <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> regimes, other shipments and factor prices. Regression results show that the protection regimes are not statistically significant to enhance output expansion. This implies policies ineffectiveness and invalidates the call for the trade restrictions. The other shipments variable enhances output demand while the prices of the steel substitutes do not. Given the results here and for the fact that the mini-mills were competitive during the regime periods, a competition, not protective trade may be warranted. ...|$|E
