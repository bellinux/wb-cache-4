5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Nisshin was {{assigned}} to the 3rd Fleet for the invasion and occupation of Sakhalin in July–August. On 2 September 1911, the ship escorted the ex-Russian hospital ship Anegawa to Vladivostok to be returned to <b>the</b> <b>Russians.</b> <b>In</b> November 1912, a boiler exploded aboard the ship, killing 20 crewmen. At the start of 1914, she was overhauled with her boilers replaced by 12 Kampon Type 1 water-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|Bremen {{served on}} the East American Station for the {{majority}} of her career, including the ten years before the outbreak of World War I. She returned to Germany in 1914 {{before the start of the}} war. At the onset of hostilities, she was attached to the fleet in the Baltic tasked with containing <b>the</b> <b>Russians.</b> <b>In</b> August 1915, she participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, but did not see significant action during the battle. Four months later, on 17 December, she struck two Russian naval mines and sank, with the loss of 250 of her crew.|$|E
5|$|Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, {{which ended}} {{the war on}} the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany, {{the main focus of}} the Ottoman Army turned to the Anatolian provinces and territories lost in 1877–1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. The Ottoman Army {{embarked}} on a series of territorial conquests in the Caucasus beginning in northern Persia. Erzerum which had been captured by <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. Reoccupation of these former possessions brought little strategic advantage to the Ottoman Empire, compared with the potential benefits of military success in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|In Colonel Redl, Brandauer plays Alfred Redl, {{counter-intelligence}} {{chief of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire who was blackmailed into espionage for <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent the revelation of his homosexuality. The film won top awards in Germany and the UK, but provoked a scandal in Austria, where several periodicals accused the film of bringing the country into disrepute. In Hanussen, Brandauer plays the real life clairvoyant performer Erik Jan Hanussen, whose growing fame brings him into increasingly close—and dangerous—contact with the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|The Prussians {{lost their}} entire horse {{artillery}}, {{an amalgam of}} cavalry and artillery in which the crews rode horses into battle, dragging their cannons behind them, one of Frederick's notable inventions. The Prussians also lost 60 percent of their cavalry, killed or wounded, animals and men. The Prussians lost 172 of their own cannons plus the 105 that they had captured from <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> the late morning on the Mühlberge. They also lost 27 flags and two standards.|$|E
5|$|The Russian and French armies met in February 1807 at {{the savage}} and indecisive Battle of Eylau, which left behind between 30,000–50,000 casualties. Napoleon regrouped his forces {{after the battle}} and {{continued}} to pursue <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> upcoming months. The action in Poland finally culminated on 14 June 1807, when the French mauled their Russian opponents at the Battle of Friedland. The resulting Treaty of Tilsit in July ended two years of bloodshed and left France as the dominant power on the European continent. It also severely weakened Prussia and formed a Franco-Russian axis designed to resolve disputes among European nations.|$|E

5|$|The Russians had a {{numerical}} advantage {{but soon the}} tide swung as Drouet's Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The horse artillery of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for {{about a quarter of}} a mile. The casualties of <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen who was killed.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes were {{building}} three additional hemmemas at the shipyards within the fortress of Sveaborg {{when it was}} surrendered to <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> 1808, and all three were incorporated in the Russian Navy. Shortly afterward, the Russian Navy built its own 32-gun versions, with the final vessel launched as late as 1823. Two more were built in Sweden in 1809, Birger Jarl and Erik Segersäll. Birger Jarl sank in an accident in 1813 and Erik Segersäll was planned for conversion as a paddlewheel steam battery for coastal defense, though the idea was eventually abandoned and the ship scrapped in 1826.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|First Russian forces {{crossed the}} border in Ukraine {{on the night of}} 18/19 May 1792. <b>The</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> that theater would {{encounter}} significantly more resistance than they expected, as Commonwealth's top commanders, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were stationed there. Kościuszko joined Prince Poniatowski near Janów on 29 May. The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four columns of enemy armies advancing into West Ukraine and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the Southern Bug River, towards Lubar and Połonne, with Kośiuszko commanding the rear guard. Poniatowski, in face of a significant numerical inferiority of his forces, and promised reinforcements by King Poniatowski, decided to abandon Ukraine and move to Volhynia, where Połonne was to be fortified as a major defensive point, and where Lubomirski was tasked with gathering supplies.|$|E
5|$|In 1708, Leszczyński {{appointed}} Poniatowski {{his personal}} representative to Charles XII. He {{participated in the}} Battle of Holowczyn that year, and served as an aide to Charles XII during his exile in the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Poltava in 1709. Here, he worked to establish an alliance between the Ottomans and the Swedes, aiming to bring the Ottomans into the war against Russia. Due to diplomatic efforts {{on the part of}} the French, aligned with Sweden, the Ottomans began to campaign against <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> 1710. With this change in Ottoman foreign policy came the dismissal of Çorlulu Ali Pasha, Grand Vizier of Ahmed III.

5|$|Kajaani Church {{was built}} in 1896 in the Neo-Gothic style by {{architect}} Jac Ahrenberg. It replaced an earlier church on the spot which was originally built in 1656 and destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> 1716 {{at the time when}} Kajaani castle was destroyed. The second church was built 1734-35 which served the parish for 160 years until replaced with Ahrenberg's new church. The church, built from wood, has three naves and features a delicate, slender bell tower. It is decorated with English Gothic style carvings. Kajaani Orthodox Church (Kajaanin ortodoksinen seurakunta), which has a regional membership of about 1880 members is centred at Christ Church of the Transfiguration in Kajaani. The church was completed in 1959 to designs by Ilmari Ahonen. It contains murals painted by Petros Sasaki and Alkiviadis Kepolas. In the suburb of Paltaniemi is a church, originally built in 1599, and considered to be the regional centre for the Lutheran Church.|$|E
5|$|Laudon {{wanted a}} fight, so he {{swallowed}} his differences and joined <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> building fortifications. Saltykov established his troops on {{a strong position}} from which to receive the Prussian attack, concentrating his force in the center, which he calculated {{was the best way}} to counter-act any attempt by Frederick to deploy his deadly oblique order. Saltykov entrenched himself in a position running from the Judenberge through the Grosser Spitzberge to the Mühlberge, creating a bristling line of fortifications, and faced his troops to the northwest; the Judenberge, most heavily fortified, fronted what he believed would be Frederick's approach. He and the Austrian troops were stretched along the ridge that ran from the outskirts of Frankfurt to just north of the village of Kunersdorf. Anticipating that Frederick would rely on his cavalry, the Russians effectively negated any successful cavalry charge by using fallen trees to break up the ground on the approaches.|$|E
5|$|Some {{relatively}} large memorials were constructed during the war. The largest nagelfiguren was {{a statue of}} General Hindenburg, famous for his victory over <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> Prussia {{at the battle of}} Tannenberg; the 12 m tall statue was put up in Berlin, complete with scaffolding to allow participants to reach the statue and hammer nails in. By the end of the war, architects in Germany already considering how to commemorate the dead. A large, temporary memorial shrine was built in Hyde Park in August 1918, with over 100,000 visitors in its first week: it lasted over a year. The Hyde Park shrine encouraged debate in Britain about permanent war memorials in the major cities and towns. Museums to remember the events of the war also began to be commissioned; governmentally: the Imperial War Museum in Britain in 1917, Australia began a War Museum in 1917; privately, the repository of wartime records in France, Germany the Kriegsbibliothek.|$|E

5|$|Strassburg and Stralsund {{served with}} the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea against the British.

Stralsund was also present at the Battle of Dogger Bank, but was not heavily engaged. Strassburg saw action during Operation Albion against <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> the Baltic. Both ships were surrendered to the Allies {{after the end of}} the war; Strassburg was ceded to Italy and renamed Taranto; she {{served with the}} Italian Navy until 1943, when she was scuttled after the Italian surrender. She was raised by the Germans and sunk by Allied bombers twice in 1943–1944, and finally scrapped in 1946–1947. Stralsund was given to France and renamed Mulhouse. She served only until 1925, when she was placed in reserve. She was ultimately broken up in 1935.|$|E
5|$|The VC was {{introduced}} on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War.

Only 15 medals, 11 {{to members of the}} British Army, and four to the Australian Army, have been awarded since the Second World War. The traditional explanation of the source of the metal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the Siege of Sevastopol. Some research has suggested a variety of origins for the material. Research has established that the metal for most of the medals made since December 1914 came from two Chinese cannons that were captured from <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> 1855.|$|E
5|$|Vitgeft {{made another}} attempt {{to break through the}} Japanese {{blockade}} on 10 August in accordance to a direct order from the Tsar. The squadron was spotted relatively quickly and the Japanese main fleet intercepted <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>in</b> the early afternoon. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Poltava and Sevastopol were the last battleships in the Russian column and Poltava, which was slowed by engine problems, became the primary target of the Japanese battleships and armored cruisers when Vitgeft maneuvered the squadron past the Japanese and forced them into a stern chase. Shortly before sunset, a lucky hit killed Vitgeft and threw the squadron into confusion. The squadron second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, eventually gained control of the squadron and led most of them back to Port Arthur. Poltava had been hit by 12–14 shells, eight or 12 inches in caliber, and suffered 12 killed and 43 wounded; Sevastopol was only hit by several shells that killed one crewman and wounded 62 men.|$|E
