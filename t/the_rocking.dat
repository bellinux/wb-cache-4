5|$|Though {{some stories}} {{attribute}} its invention to Benjamin Franklin, historians trace <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> chair's origins to North America {{during the early}} 18th century.

5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} {{be heard over the}} sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined <b>the</b> <b>Rocking</b> Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into {{striking}} the German plane because the real gulls {{used in the}} first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds—including a boa constrictor—were used for the train scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> motion and flickering lights.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by the second tournament match pitting Chris Jericho and <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> for <b>the</b> World Championship. The two exchanged many holds and reversals in the beginning. Jericho hit a spinning heel kick, and a missile dropkick. Jericho knocked <b>The</b> <b>Rock's</b> head into <b>the</b> steel ring steps, and hit a flying back elbow. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> came back with a flying clothesline. Jericho applied a sleeper hold but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> fought out of it. Jericho then hit a one-handed bulldog and a Lionsault. Jericho went to the top rope, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> crotched him on <b>the</b> top. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> tried a Superplex but Jericho knocked him down, and hit a flying crossbody, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> rolled through. Jericho continued attacking <b>The</b> <b>Rock,</b> but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> sent Jericho's head into the ringpost. Jericho fell to the outside where he dropped <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> onto <b>the</b> barricade, and catapulted him into the ringpost. Jericho then tried to hit a <b>Rock</b> Bottom through <b>the</b> announce table, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> reversed it into a People's DDT through <b>the</b> table. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> threw Jericho into the ring and set him for a Rock Bottom, but Jericho countered it into a Breakdown. He set <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> up for <b>the</b> People's Elbow, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> caught his legs, and applied a Sharpshooter on Jericho. Jericho reversed it into his own Sharpshooter, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> got to <b>the</b> ropes to break the hold. Jericho then applied the Walls of Jericho, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> countered it into a roll-up. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> hit a Rock Bottom, as Mr. McMahon came down to ringside. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> went for <b>the</b> pinfall but McMahon distracted <b>the</b> referee. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> hit McMahon, and hit a Spinebuster on Jericho. He brought McMahon into the ring and hit Jericho with a People's Elbow. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> attacked McMahon and, while the referee checked McMahon, Jericho hit a low blow and a Rock Bottom to win the match, and the title.|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} sets of {{the boats}} were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. The photo of Tegan's Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her mind, was shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in Logopolis) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models {{of the boats}}, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while the oars were battery operated. The model of Davey's ship remained intact, with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence. Kelt {{was shocked by the}} dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop, and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One, and asked producer John Nathan-Turner if he could replace it but was told there was no money available.|$|E
25|$|By {{recording}} several images {{at different}} detuning angles, meaning at different positions on <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> curve, a data set is gained {{which allows the}} retrieval of quantitative differential phase information. There are several algorithms to reconstruct information from <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> curves, some of them provide an additional signal. This signal comes from Ultra-small-angle scattering by sub-pixel sample structures and causes angular broadening of the beam and hence a broadening of the shape of <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> curve. Based on this scattering contrast {{a new kind of}} image called Dark-field image can be produced.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> {{activation}} of <b>rock</b> bolts anchored in <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> massif at <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> bolt termination by the deformation process of <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> mantle of an underground opening {{of circular cross-section}} driven in the virgin hydrostatic stress field, i. e. with a centrically symetrical deformation. From the solution follows that <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> bolt activation by the deformation process of <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> massif depends on {{the depth of the}} opening under the surface, modulus of deformation, and Poissons number of <b>the</b> <b>rock,</b> length, and <b>the</b> building density of rock bolts, {{as well as on the}} initial deformation of the opening formed prior to <b>the</b> installing <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> bolts...|$|R
50|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was the {{encounter}} of Goldberg and The Rock; the main feud from the Raw brand {{heading into the}} event. The feud began on the March 31, 2003 episode of Raw, where <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> held a segment entitled <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> Appreciation Night, a segment intended to promote his win against Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIX. During <b>the</b> segment, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> discussed <b>the</b> list of people he has beaten in his career including Steve Austin, wondering who would challenge him next into a match. Goldberg then made his WWE debut, as he {{came down to the}} ring and stated that he would be <b>The</b> <b>Rock's</b> next challenge. After the confrontation, Goldberg speared <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> <b>The</b> following week on Raw, Goldberg and <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> had another confrontation, where Goldberg provoked <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> into answering his challenge, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> refused. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> finally accepted Goldberg's challenge on the April 14, 2003 episode of Raw via satellite. The week before Backlash, the feud intensified as <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> held another segment entitled <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> Concert, where he mocked Goldberg with Gillberg, a wrestler whose gimmick was to parody Goldberg. Later into the segment, Goldberg appeared from the audience and entered the ring, only to have <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> execute a Rock Bottom on him.|$|R
50|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} SummerSlam was between <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> and Booker T, battling over the WCW Championship. After losing the WWF Championship to Steve Austin at WrestleMania X-Seven, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> took a hiatus from {{professional}} wrestling to film the movie, The Scorpion King. On the edition of July 9, 2001 of Raw Is War, campaigning for <b>The</b> <b>Rock's</b> return began. Following <b>the</b> campaigning, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> returned to <b>the</b> WWF on the edition of July 30, 2001 of Raw Is War, where {{he chose to}} align himself with the WWF instead of The Alliance for The Invasion. This action was shown by <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> delivering a <b>Rock</b> Bottom and <b>the</b> people's elbow onto Shane McMahon, The Alliance leader. Later that week on SmackDown!, Booker T and <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> cut a promo, where Booker T challenged <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> to a match at SummerSlam; {{the beginning of the}} Rock-Booker T rivalry. Seeking revenge for the attack on the edition of July 30, 2001 of Raw Is War, McMahon fought <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> in a Street Fight on the edition of August 6 of Raw Is War, where <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> pinned McMahon. <b>The</b> rivalry between <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> and Booker T intensified after the match, where Booker T and Shane McMahon double-teamed <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> Later that week on SmackDown!, in retaliation, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> accepted Booker T's challenge. On the edition of August 13 of Raw Is War, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> was involved in a tag team match, where he teamed with Chris Jericho in a loss to Booker T and Rhyno. After the match, Booker T delivered his variation of <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> Bottom on <b>The</b> <b>Rock,</b> a move dubbed, The Book End. On the final edition of SmackDown! before SummerSlam, McMahon announced that Booker T would defend the WCW Championship at SummerSlam against <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> Later that night, the rivalry continued to intensify during a Lights Out match between Booker T and <b>The</b> <b>Rock,</b> after Booker T delivered a Book End onto <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> through a commentators announce table.|$|R

25|$|Drive {{was taken}} from <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> arm of an exhaust valve, a lever fixed to the valve housing {{transmitting}} impulses to the gun through a rod. Designed by Leutnant Otto Bernatzik, it was geared down to deliver a firing impulse every second revolution of the propeller, and fired at about 380 to 400 rounds per gun. As with other gears synchronizing the Schwarzlose gun, firing became erratic at high engine speeds.|$|E
25|$|Using {{his newly}} {{developed}} electromagnetic principle, Henry in 1831 created {{one of the}} first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern DC motor. It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole, rocking back and forth. <b>The</b> <b>rocking</b> motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Hurricane feuded with <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> In {{backstage}} segments, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> {{referred to}} <b>The</b> Hurricane as [...] "The Hamburglar" [...] (in part because his mask {{was similar to}} the Hamburglar's). The feud culminated in a match on Raw, in which <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> dominated. Hurricane, however, was able to roll up <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> from behind after <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> was distracted by Stone Cold Steve Austin's appearance on the ramp.|$|R
50|$|One {{hot summer}} day, Napi, the supernatural trickster of the Blackfoot peoples, rested on <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> because <b>the</b> day {{was warm and}} he was tired. He spread his robe on <b>the</b> <b>rock,</b> telling <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> to keep <b>the</b> robe in return for letting Napi rest there. Suddenly, the weather changed and Napi became cold as the wind whistled and the rain fell. Napi asked <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> to return his robe, but <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> refused. Napi got mad and just took the clothing. As he strolled away, he heard a loud noise and turning, he saw <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> was rolling after him. Napi ran for his life. The deer, the bison and the {{pronghorn}} were Napi's friends, {{and they tried to}} stop <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> by running in front of it. <b>The</b> <b>rock</b> rolled over them. Napi's last chance was to call on the bats for help. Fortunately, they did better than their hoofed neighbours, and by diving at <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> and colliding with it, one of them finally hit <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> just right and it broke into two pieces.|$|R
25|$|The {{atoms in}} a CH2X2 group, {{commonly}} found in organic compounds and where X can represent any other atom, can vibrate in nine different ways. Six of these vibrations involve only the CH2 portion: symmetric and antisymmetric stretching, scissoring, rocking, wagging and twisting, as shown below. Structures {{that do not have}} the two additional X groups attached have fewer modes because some modes are defined by specific relationships to those other attached groups. For example, in water, <b>the</b> <b>rocking,</b> wagging, and twisting modes do not exist because these types of motions of the H represent simple rotation of the whole molecule rather than vibrations within it.|$|E
25|$|Toys {{became more}} {{widespread}} {{with the changing}} attitudes towards children engendered by the Enlightenment. Children began {{to be seen as}} people in and of themselves, as opposed to extensions of their household and that they had a right to flourish and enjoy their childhood. The variety and number of toys that were manufactured during the 18th century steadily rose; John Spilsbury invented the first jigsaw puzzle in 1767 to help children learn geography. He created puzzles on eight themes – the World, Europe, Asia, Africa, America, England and Wales, Ireland and Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>rocking</b> horse (on bow rockers) was developed {{at the same time in}} England, especially with the wealthy as it was thought to develop children's balance for riding real horses.|$|E
25|$|The pot is {{then brought}} {{on board the}} boat and the crew sorts the king crab. Any crab not meeting the {{regulation}} requirements are thrown back. The crabs are stored live in a holding tank until the boat reaches shore, where they are sold. If the weather becomes too cold the live crabs may freeze and burst. If they are left in the tank for too long they will harm and possibly kill {{each other as they}} can be cannibalistic. Even <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> of the boat can cause damage to the crab, so boards are inserted in the holds to prevent excessive side-to-side movement. If a crab dies in the hold for any reason it releases toxins which can kill other crabs. If the crew fails to remove the dead crabs, they can poison the entire tank and ruin the catch.|$|E

25|$|The next {{match was}} an Intercontinental Championship match between Faarooq and <b>the</b> champion, <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> After Faarooq made his entrance, Howard Finkel {{announced}} <b>The</b> <b>Rock's</b> entrance; however, {{he did not}} come out and after a second announcement, Commissioner Slaughter came out and gave <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> ten seconds to come out. If <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> failed to come out, he would be stripped of the championship. After Slaughter counted to two, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> came out wearing a neck brace, from the earlier attack, and before {{he was able to}} get into the ring, Faarooq attacked <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> in <b>the</b> aisle. After they entered the ring, the two wrestlers fought back and forth until Faarooq Spinebustered <b>The</b> <b>Rock,</b> and attempted to pin him, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> broke <b>the</b> pin at a two count after he placed his foot on the bottom ring rope. As Faarooq argued with <b>the</b> referee, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> retaliated by rolling up Faarooq into a pinfall to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|R
25|$|Subsequently, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> {{defeated}} <b>The</b> British Bulldog in a singles match {{by performing}} a Rock Bottom and People's Elbow. After <b>the</b> match, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> cut a promo where he challenged {{the winner of}} the main event to a match. Triple H, however, came out and hit <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> with a sledgehammer, which caused <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> to be taken backstage by a stretcher.

Another open cluster in Cygnus is NGC 6910, also called <b>the</b> <b>Rocking</b> Horse Cluster, possessing 16 stars with a diameter of 5 arcminutes visible in a small amateur instrument; it is of magnitude 7.4. The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent {{the bottom of the}} toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.|$|E
25|$|Those aboard Collapsible B {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} night. The boat gradually sank lower {{into the water}} as the air pocket underneath it leaked away. The sea began to get up towards dawn, causing the boat to rock in the swell and lose more of its precious air. Lightoller organised {{the men on the}} hull to stand in two parallel rows {{on either side of the}} centreline, facing the bow, and got them to sway in unison to counteract <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> motion caused by the swell. They were directly exposed to the freezing seawater, first up to their feet, then to their ankles and finally to their knees as the boat subsided in the water. For some, the ordeal proved too much and one by one they collapsed, fell into the water and died. The victims possibly included John George Phillips, the first radio officer, and the third class passenger David Livshin, whose body was taken to the Carpathia on the following morning. About 30 people were left alive by the morning and were transferred into other lifeboats before being rescued by Carpathia.|$|E
500|$|Today, three {{versions}} of the work survive. Initially in 1913, Sibelius conceived of the commission as a three-movement suite for orchestra in E major, of which only No.2 (Tempo moderato) and No.3 (Allegro) are extant. At some point in 1913–14, Sibelius decided to rework the thematic material of the Allegro, very much a [...] "work in progress", into a single-movement symphonic poem; the musical content of the Tempo moderato would {{find its way into}} the piano piece [...] (To Longing), JS202. In making the transition from suite to tone poem, Sibelius transposed the material from E to D major; in addition, he also introduced new musical ideas, such as <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> wave-like motif in the strings and woodwinds, and expanded the orchestration.|$|E

500|$|When Berry was {{released}} from prison in 1963 his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bands—notably the Beatles and the Rolling Stones—had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs, and other bands had reworked some of them, such as the Beach Boys' 1963 hit [...] "Surfin' U.S.A.", which used the melody of Berry's [...] "Sweet Little Sixteen". In 1964 and 1965 Berry released eight singles, including three that were commercially successful, reaching the top 20 of the Billboard 100: [...] "No Particular Place to Go" [...] (a humorous reworking of [...] "School Days", concerning the introduction of seat belts in cars), [...] "You Never Can Tell", and <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> [...] "Nadine". Between 1966 and 1969 Berry released five albums for Mercury Records, including his first live album, Live at Fillmore Auditorium, in which he was backed by the Steve Miller Band.|$|E
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate <b>the</b> <b>rocking</b> arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|E

After the bell rang, Cena struck first before <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> {{seized control of}} the match and halted Cena’s {{momentum}} by sending him scrambling outside the ring to regroup within the bout’s opening moments. The match went on while <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> had control by striking Cena with blows and punches. Cena then locked <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> into an Crossface, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> countered into a pin for a 2-count. Cena then locked <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> in an STF, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> powered out. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> then executed a Rock Bottom on Cena {{but only for a}} 2-count. Cena then performed an AA on <b>The</b> <b>Rock,</b> but only got a 2-count. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> soon delivered a People's Elbow on Cena for another 2-count. Cena soon went for a second AA, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> countered into a second Rock Bottom for a 2-count yet again. A frustrated Rock nearly fell into the same trap Cena did the year before when he taunted Cena with Cena's own [...] "You Can't See Me" [...] taunt before going for a second People's Elbow, however Cena caught <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> and delivered a second AA for another near-fall. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> soon went for a third Rock Bottom, but Cena countered and executed a Rock Bottom instead for a nearfall. Cena then tried to sucker <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> into a third AA by faking a People's Elbow attempt, the same mistake that cost Cena the match the last year. However, when Cena went for the third AA, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> countered into a third Rock Bottom for another 2 count. Afterwards, both John Cena and <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> went for an AA and a Rock Bottom respectively. This continued until <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> delivered a DDT on Cena.
