40|$|In {{order to}} allow users to use {{handheld}} devices accessing video information, such as downloading and playing video files, {{there is a need}} to downscale the compressed video into lower spatial resolution and lower <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rate. In this work, transcoding the compressed H. 263 video into low spatial-resolution is discussed and realized. To reduce the computation cost, motion vectors from the incoming video stream are resampled and reused. We propose a novel approach to refine motion vectors adaptively according to the motion of every frame or every macroblock in a frame. The proposed approach can improve the video quality and reduce predictive residues of every frame, hence reduce the <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rate.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel minimum {{transmit}} power-based (MP) packet scheduling algorithm that can achieve power-efficient transmission to the UEs while providing both system throughput gain and fairness improvement. The proposed algorithm {{is based on}} the ratio of the transmit power to the number of <b>transmission</b> <b>bits.</b> Thus, the proposed MP scheduler allocates the physical resource block (PRB) to the UE that requires the least ratio of the transmit power per bit. For this, it is assumed that the channel quality indication (CQI) information for all UE channels is available at the evolved Node B (eNB), with which the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level and the UE transmit power are determined. The performance of the proposed MP algorithm is compared with the conventional algorithms through computer simulation, considering real-time and non-real-time traffic in multicell environments.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{presented}} the decoupled packet scheduling algorithms in 3 GPP LTE systems and proposed a novel algorithm which considers {{the efficiency of}} transmit power consumption. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated by comparing with the conventional algorithms: the maximum throughput (MT), round robin (RR), and proportional fairness (PF). From the simulation results, the MP-MP algorithm applying the proposed minimum transmit power-based packet scheduling (MP) algorithm to the time domain packet scheduler (TDPS) and the frequency domain packet scheduler (FDPS) in 3 GPP LTE systems showed better throughput performances than the other conventional algorithms. Moreover, the MP-MP algorithm showed significant improvement of the fairness performance, which comes from the different packet scheduling metric regarding {{the ratio of the}} transmit power to the number of <b>transmission</b> <b>bits.</b> Conclusively, from the results, we confirm that the proposed scheduling metric successfully improves the system performance such as the fairness and throughput. Further work includes CQI reporting scheme because the performance of the proposed downlink scheduling algorithm, as well as the conventional ones, depends on the accuracy of the CQI information.|$|E

In this paper, {{we have developed}} a two-dimensional (2 D) chaos-based encryption scheme {{that can be applied}} to signals with <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> errors in clinical electroencephalography (EEG) and mobile telemedicine. As opposed to one-dimensional (1 D) chaos-based encryption, the proposed 2 D schemes uses the concept of parallel processing to increase the encryption speed.

30|$|It is {{also found}} {{that most of the}} gain of average user {{throughput}} of mixed traffic UEs in Figure 3 (a) comes from the NRT traffic UEs in Figure 3 (b). It is because NRT traffic UEs having BE feature can receive as many available data as possible, while RT traffic UEs do not receive more data than their target data rates. In Figure 3 (c), the MP algorithm also shows the best capacity of RT traffic because more capacity is provided when the algorithm is applied. Under the same maximum number of UEs in a cell, the MP-MP algorithm shows the best throughput per UE. This result indicates that better average user throughput occurs with more UEs. It is because of efficiency of transmit power consumption. Under the saturation of a cell, the transmit power consumption becomes a more critical issue because power is a limited resource. Therefore, from the results, the packet scheduling algorithm by the ratio of the transit power to the number of <b>transmission</b> <b>bits</b> provides a great increase of the average user throughput.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of channel coding, the Generalized Belief Propagation (GBP) is an {{iterative}} algorithm used to recover the <b>transmission</b> <b>bits</b> sent through a noisy channel. To ensure a reliable transmission, we apply a map on the bits, that is called a code. This code induces artificial correlations between the bits to send, {{and it can be}} modeled by a graph whose nodes are the bits and the edges are the correlations. This graph, called Tanner graph, is used for most of the decoding algorithms like Belief Propagation or Gallager-B. The GBP is based on a non unic transformation of the Tanner graph into a so called region-graph. A clear advantage of the GBP over the other algorithms is the freedom in the construction of this graph. In this article, we explain a particular construction for specific graph topologies that involves relevant performance of the GBP. Moreover, we investigate the behavior of the GBP considered as a dynamic system {{in order to understand the}} way it evolves in terms of the time and in terms of the noise power of the channel.

40|$|Time-slotted ALOHA {{packetized}} multiple-access {{has been}} extensively used in satellite communications, and has recently been attracting considerable attention in wireless Adhoc networks. In this paper, we consider a time-slotted ALOHA system which combines multiple-access, broadcasting channels and rate splitting. This system allows some <b>transmission</b> <b>bits</b> to be reliably received even when collisions occur and more bits to be reliably received {{in the absence of}} collisions. In contrast to previous work, our work focuses on the case in which the transmission channels obey i. i. d (independent and identically distributed) Rayleigh fading. Two fundamental problems are considered. The first one is the calculation of the system capacity, and the second one is how to select an appropriate channel coding scheme with which the system achieves its capacity. We shall review the single time slotted capacity, and present the total capacity expression with the knowledge of channel side information. We will then derive a threshold for the transmission probability in a single time slot provided that all the users have the same transmission probability. It will be shown that when the transmission probability is greater than the derived threshold, low-resolution codes can help the system achieve its capacity. We shall also present an explicit estimation method for computing the threshold, and prove that it can be extended to the more general case when the transmission probabilities are approximately equal...|$|E
40|$|A 2 D RAKE {{receiver}} for a direct-sequence {{spread spectrum}} communications {{system is a}} space-time processor that cancels strong multi-user access interference while optimally combining multipath for the desired user. A recently proposed scheme involves passing the output of each antenna through a matched filter based on the spreading waveform of the desired user, and then estimating the signal plus interference space-time correlation matrix during {{that portion of the}} bit interval where the fingers of the RAKE occur. The interference alone space-time correlation matrix is estimated during that portion of the bit interval away from the “fingers”. The weight vector yielding the optimum signal to interference plus noise ratio for bit decisions is the “largest” generalized eigenvector of the resulting matrix pencil. However, even when the number of elements comprising the array is relatively small, this space-time correlation matrix pencil is of very large dimension. In addition to detracting from the real-time applicability of the scheme, this also causes a slow convergence rate. A reduced dimension blind space-time 2 D RAKE receiver is presented based on a novel frequency domain implementation of a RAKE receiver and a data adaptive transformation to a lower dimension beamspace that contains most of the desired user 2 ̆ 7 s energy. An adaptation of the scheme for the IS- 95 uplink is then presented. We present a decision directed variation of the aforementioned blind 2 D RAKE receiver that reliably estimates which Walsh function was sent for every six <b>transmission</b> <b>bits.</b> Due to the high computational complexity of the eigenanalysis based algorithms, we propose a blind 2 D RAKE receiver based on RLS-type space-time adaptive filtering to update the space-time weight vector on a per space-time snapshot basis as its adaptive solution.

This information may be used for enhancing the performance of the demodulation process, “smart” downlink beamforming, and geolocation. Simulations will be presented demonstrating the efficacy of these proposed methods. ...|$|E
30|$|However, in {{wireless}} communication environments where {{a large number}} of terminals exist in an assumed 5 G scenario, and a large amount of information is simultaneously exchanged, wireless security for each transmission is equally important. In other words, it is important to ensure confidentiality by encryption to prevent information from leaking to third parties and eavesdroppers during wireless transmissions. In current communication systems, upper layer encryption protocols such as public key cryptography are mainly used. However, the enhancement of encryption properties only in the upper layer often leads to protocol complications and an increase in calculation complexity. Therefore, ensuring the integrity of {{wireless communication}} only in the upper layer is not desirable, but a similar approach in the physical layer where the modulated signal is encrypted is also effective. The physical layer encryption can enhance security protocols when it is concurrently used with the upper layer encryption, or can, otherwise, simplify the upper layer security protocol. As with regards to physical layer security schemes, we have proposed a chaos multiple-input multiple-output (C-MIMO) transmission method, which has both the functionality of encrypted modulation and channel coding, for exploiting the principle of chaos communications [7]. In this method, Gaussian modulated signals are generated from chaos signals correlated with <b>transmission</b> <b>bits</b> in a short block, and these signals are transmitted by MIMO spatial multiplexing. A chaos signal is irregular and unpredictable, but its behavior is deterministically controlled by the initial chaos value. By taking advantage of this feature, the initial chaos value {{can be used as a}} signal key shared by the transmitter and receiver in the C-MIMO system, thereby achieving the physical layer encryption effect based on common key encryption. In essence, only a valid user at the receiver end who has the same signal key used in the transmitter can correctly decode the received signals, thus blocking out third party intrusions. In addition, C-MIMO has a channel coding effect at a coding rate of 1 by convoluting the transmission bit to the chaos signal in generating the transmission signal. Thus, C-MIMO can provide secure and high-quality wireless transmission. However, C-MIMO is a link transmission scheme, and has not been applied for high-capacity allocation multiple access technologies such as 5 G.|$|E
