5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I <b>think</b> <b>someone,</b> maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
500|$|Erik Ernst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel {{said the}} song was [...] "ridiculously catchy". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly decided that [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was Cyrus' bouncy attempt at urban music, since she had {{previously}} transitioned into other markets. Jessica Holland of The Observer deemed [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{one of the highlights}} on The Time of Our Lives. Michael Menachem of Billboard stated {{the song was}} one of Cyrus' most entertaining songs. Menachem continued, [...] " [...] injects the song with an energy recalling Robyn and early Gwen Stefani. After successfully tackling dance and country formats and delivering one of the year's strongest ballads ('The Climb'), Cyrus continues to show off her impressive range." [...] Ryan Brockington of The New York Post said that although the track was more mainstream than Cyrus' prior singles, he did not hate it. Vicki Lutas of BCC described [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] as [...] "a breath of fresh air" [...] while being [...] "seriously stomping" [...] and slightly relatable. She said the song's best attribute was Cyrus' voice and concluded that Cyrus contains an ability of making her voice sound interesting all the time. Upon listening to the track, Lutas feels that [...] "suddenly you <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> else is in the room with you and you've got all the ingredients for, well, a huge party contained in one little song." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the album's {{listening}} {{party on}} August 20, 2012 at Germano Studios in Manhattan, New York, Two Elevens executive producer Breyon Prescott revealed {{that there would}} be fifteen songs on the final track listing. Eleven of the songs were previewed at the album party but not all were completely mixed, mastered or finished. The album's first single [...] "Put It Down" [...] featuring Chris Brown has a distinctly hip-hop flavour, with Norwood taking on her [...] "rap-singing" [...] vocal performance she last used when assuming her persona of Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009). The song is built around a [...] "mid-tempo thumping production" [...] courtesy of Bangladesh. Its co-writer and co-producer Sean Garrett revealed that [...] "Put It Down" [...] was a [...] "good segway" [...] to {{what the rest of the}} album would sound like. By contrast not all of Garrett's songs follow the same flow. The album's second single, titled [...] "Wildest Dreams", was also written by Garrett, but this time produced by The Bizzness. An introspective ballad, [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] speaks about Norwood's losing out emotionally. Lyrics include the line [...] "Never in my wildest dreams did I <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> could care 'bout me/ Not just the way you love me, but you know I'm emotional (sometimes)." [...] During the course of the song, Norwood mentions herself several times, over the [...] "thawacking percussion" [...] and production.|$|E
