5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End was a third-person {{perspective}} survival horror {{title for}} the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, which was originally announced in November 2002 as a PlayStation 2-exclusive Call of Cthulhu: Tainted Legacy for a planned release in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> 2004. It {{was to be a}} direct sequel to Dark Corners of the Earth, set in the ruins of Innsmouth and in locations along the coast of New England in modern times, nearly 80 years after the events of the original game. It was to feature a cooperative multiplayer mode for two players, each controlling one of the two characters: the gun-wielding Jacob and the magic-using Emily (in its early version, Tainted Legacy, they were Joshua and Jack Walters' granddaughter Madeline). Its gameplay was publicly presented during the E3 2005.|$|E

Denver passed an initiative in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance.

5|$|The {{game was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, {{it is the most}} successful game by developer id Software to date. Critics praised the game's graphics and presentation, although reviewers were divided by how close the gameplay was to that of the original Doom, focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters. The game was followed by , an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software in April 2005, while a Doom film loosely based on the series was released in October 2005. A series of novelizations of Doom 3, written by Matthew J. Costello, debuted in February 2008.

Bud Schwenk made his first appearance in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the game, substituting for Graham as the game turned into a blowout. He threw for a fifth touchdown, a 20-yard pass to Bill Lund. Edgar Jones added to Cleveland's scoring with a touchdown run in the first quarter, and center Frank Gatski scored the team's final touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}} after intercepting a pass and running it back 36 yards. It was the only touchdown of Gatski's 12-year career. Groza made a 51-yard field goal, the longest of the year in either the National Football League or AAFC, and kicked through six of the team's seven extra points. The seventh extra point was blocked, only the second time he missed a conversion in 33 tries.

Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, {{the last of his}} career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench.

On a night when teammate Jabari Parker went down with a knee injury, Middleton looked spry in limited action, scoring five points in 15 minutes in a 106–88 loss to the Miami Heat. Seven days later, in his fourth game back, Middleton scored a season-high 20 points in a 129–125 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He topped that mark on March 1, scoring 21 points to go with five rebounds and five assists in a 110–98 loss to the Denver Nuggets.

40|$|Abstract: Cinematic {{tradition}} {{suggests that}} Hollywood films, like plays, {{are divided into}} acts. Thompson (1999) streamlined the conception of this largescale film structure by suggesting that most films are composed of four acts of generally equal length—the setup, the complicating action, the development, and the climax (often including an epilog). These acts {{are based on the}} structure of the narrative, and would not necessarily have a physical manifestation in shots and transitions. Nonetheless, exploring a sample of 150 Hollywood style films from 1935 to 2005, this article demonstrates that acts shape shot lengths and transitions. Dividing films into quarters, we found that shots are longer at quarter boundaries and generally shorter near the middle <b>of</b> each <b>quarter.</b> Moreover, aside from the beginnings and ends of films, the article shows that fades, dissolves, and other non-cut transitions are more common in the third and less common in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> films...|$|R
40|$|The Value of a Government Monitor for Firms with Hard-to-Value Assets Do federal bank {{examinations}} {{add value}} to the market's supervisory process?

Using data from <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> 1988 and 1990, we find that government examinations can significantly affect the market's interpretation of reported book values, although the particular effects vary between years and according to a bank's specific characteristics. Our results imply that individual examination visits do not directly affect bank market values, although they do improve the quality of reported accounting numbers. Federal examinations are generally motivated by the government's need to control insured banks' 1 risk-taking and to permit efficient resolution of failed institutions in a legal environment which exempts b [...] ...|$|R
