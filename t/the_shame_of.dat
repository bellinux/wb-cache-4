5|$|The Action of 13 September 1810 was an {{inconclusive}} frigate engagement {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates during which a British frigate {{was defeated by}} two French vessels near Isle de France (now Mauritius), but British reinforcements were able to recapture the ship before the French could secure her. The British frigate was HMS Africaine, a new arrival to the Indian Ocean. She was {{under the command of}} Captain Robert Corbet, who had served there the previous year. Corbet was a notoriously unpopular officer and his death in the battle provoked a storm of controversy in Britain over claims that Corbet had either committed suicide at <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> losing his ship, been murdered by his disaffected crew, or been abandoned by his men, who were said to have refused to load their guns while he remained in command. Whether any of these rumours were accurate has never been satisfactorily determined, but the issue has been discussed in several prominent naval histories and was the subject of at least one lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|In these lectures, Newman denounced various anti-Catholic utterances.

25|$|Contrastingly {{in other}} Asian cultures, {{especially}} for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other {{factors such as}} education. Academic success of a student {{is seen as a}} source of pride and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work hard to avoid academic failure which brings shame to the family. In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In Japan, for example, ritualized suicide practices such as harakiri were committed by Japanese samurai for centuries {{in the event of a}} defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties. It establishes {{that there}} may be an inverse relation between <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties and their deterrent effects - the more people are <b>shamed</b> <b>the</b> less deterring <b>shaming</b> penalties become. This conclusion is based on a search model in which the costs of searching for law-abiding partners increase with <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming,</b> and may lead to lower expected sanction for offenders. The inverse relation between <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties and their effectiveness is later used to show that increasing the probability of detection, increasing <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties or reducing the number of wrongful acquittals does not necessarily increase <b>the</b> deterrent effects <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties (and may, in fact, decrease these effects). ...|$|R

25|$|Alice courageously faces <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> bearing and rearing their illegitimate {{daughter}} Anna alone. This ordeal is {{the test}} of the title—of herself, her family, and her community. Her story is paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, a sinner of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified {{by most of the}} small-minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold feet at the news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost her own child, importunes her to let her have Anna instead; persuaded {{it would be in the}} best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies.|$|E
25|$|Eliade {{provided}} {{two distinct}} explanations {{for not having}} met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the Gestapo, and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend. Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the Israeli magazine Toladot, who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the Final Solution in Romania and of how this could affect Sebastian (see Holocaust in Romania). In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could {{have contributed to the}} clash between the two literary figures.|$|E

To avoid <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> his daughter's actions, Oeij Se moves to Batavia. Some months later Kim Nio (now a Muslim and known as Siti Fatimah) visits, seemingly to make amends with her family.

In 1995, he performed drums as part of Gilbert's touring band, Thud, which recorded a live album, Live at the Troubadour, released in 1999. After Gilbert's death in 1996, D'Virgilio was asked by Gilbert's estate to complete his second solo album, <b>The</b> <b>Shaming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> True, based on the extant tapes and Gilbert's notes.

25|$|In {{order to}} uphold the Senjinkun {{military}} code, it was considered extremely dishonourable to become an enemy prisoner in Japan at the time, even in a situation as desperate as the one faced by the Japanese Army in New Guinea. In the Japanese Army Penal Code, commanding officers ordering their troops to surrender {{was treated as a}} form of desertion, and even when troops gave their all in battle, surrender was still punishable by six months' imprisonment (article 41). Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, commander of the 18th Army, also gave an order on 18 March 1945, telling his soldiers that they should under no circumstances bring upon themselves <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> being taken prisoner. As a result, examples of the Japanese Army surrendering as a group are extremely rare. Apart from Takenaga's unit, the only other examples of group surrender by the Japanese Army in the Pacific War were two other groups in New Guinea that are discussed below, and the Army Naval Raiding Squadron, commanded by Umezawa and defending Zamami Island, in the Battle of Okinawa. However, Takenaga's unit was not the first example; there was a previous incident in May, 1905, at the Battle of Mukden in the Russo-Japanese War, where 42 survivors of a company of the 49th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Division were all taken prisoner.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

500|$|Critics drew close {{comparisons}} between Obsessed and Adrian Lyne's 1987 stalker thriller Fatal Attraction. However, two distinctions noted were that Obsessed contains no bunny boiling-like incidents, and that Derek and Lisa {{did not actually}} have sexual intercourse. John Anderson of Variety wrote, [...] "If Derek had actually slept with Lisa, a la Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction, Obsessed would at least have had the spurned-woman gambit to play, however hoary." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film zero out of four stars, and wrote that Derek's {{lack of interest in}} Lisa allowed for no conflict in the film. Travers concluded, [...] "Everything you need to know is in the trailer." [...] The Daily Telegraph Tim Robey thought that Obsessed would have been more entertaining had Lisa's character been fiercer like Alex Forrest in Fatal Attraction. Rickey opined that while the lack of infidelity made the film less thrilling, it [...] "is about the sanctity of marriage rather than <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> adultery." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{action was}} {{considered}} a defeat by the Admiralty and was not reported in the London Gazette. The British naval authorities were particularly disturbed by rumours that began to circulate concerning the death of Captain Corbet and the behaviour of his crew during the battle. Prominent among these rumours was the suggestion that Corbet had been murdered by his disaffected crew: historian William James wrote in 1827 that [...] "There are many who will insist, that Captain Corbett's [...] death-wound was inflicted {{by one of his}} own people." [...] although he goes on to point out the unlikelihood of Corbet being shot by one of his own cannon. He gives more credence to the story that Corbet committed suicide to avoid <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> defeat, that he [...] "cut the bandages from his amputated limb, and suffered himself to bleed to death." [...] This story was also alluded to in Edward Pelham Brenton's 1825 history: [...] "Corbet did not (we fear would not) survive his capture". The truth of Corbet's end will never be known with certainty, although James ultimately concludes that Corbet's wound was almost certainly a mortal one and thus the most likely cause of death.|$|E
500|$|From November 2008 to January 2009, Morrissey {{returned}} to the theatre {{for the first time}} in nine years to appear in the Almeida Theatre's British premiere of Neil LaBute's In a Dark Dark House. He played Terry, one of two brothers who had been abused as a child, opposite Steven Mackintosh and Kira Sternbach. He took the role because he liked LaBute's previous play, The Mercy Seat (2002). After accepting the part, he researched the character by reading case studies of adults who were abused when they were children. He learned about how they coped with <b>the</b> <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> their abuse, and incorporated those feelings into his acting. He was also able to consult LaBute during rehearsals but avoided asking him exactly how to play Terry. In a Daily Telegraph review that criticised the play, Charles Spencer wrote that Morrissey's was the best performance [...] "as the blue-collar older brother who reveals extraordinary depths of grief, damage and forgiveness that finally light up this dark, flawed play." [...] Benedict Nightingale of The Times initially believed that Morrissey's acting was [...] "a bit stiff, almost as if he was waiting for his cues rather than reacting instantaneously to their content" [...] but found him more impressive as the play went on.|$|E
