25|$|The DE-9IM {{offers a}} full {{descriptive}} assertion {{about the two}} input geometries. It is a mathematical function that represents {{a complete set of}} all possible relations about two entities, like a <b>Truth</b> <b>table,</b> the Three-way comparison, a Karnaugh map or a Venn diagram. Each output value is like a <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> line, that represent relations of specific inputs.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} Boolean {{results are}} transferred from a <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> onto a two-dimensional grid where, in Karnaugh maps, the cells are ordered in Gray code, and each cell position represents one combination of input conditions, while each cell value represents the corresponding output value. Optimal groups of 1s or 0s are identified, which represent {{the terms of}} a canonical form of the logic in the original <b>truth</b> <b>table.</b> These terms can be used to write a minimal Boolean expression representing the required logic.|$|E
500|$|Some truth {{functions}} are noncommutative, since the <b>truth</b> <b>tables</b> for the {{functions are}} different when one changes {{the order of}} the operands. For example, the <b>truth</b> <b>tables</b> for f (A, B) [...] A Λ ¬B (A AND NOT B) and f (B, A) [...] B Λ ¬A are ...|$|R

25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} used to {{facilitate}} the simplification of Boolean algebra functions. For example, consider the Boolean function described by the following <b>truth</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
25|$|Logical connectives. A formula in {{the form}} , , etc. is {{evaluated}} according to the <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> for the connective in question, as in propositional logic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} above, the four input {{variables}} {{can be combined}} in 16 different ways, so the <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> has 16 rows, and the Karnaugh map has 16 positions. The Karnaugh map is therefore arranged in a 4×4 grid.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Truth</b> <b>tables</b> {{can be used}} {{to prove}} many other logical equivalences. For example, {{consider}} the following truth table: ...|$|R
25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} {{correspond to}} truth tables for the propositions , , etc., {{in the sense}} that each region of Venn diagram corresponds to one row of the <b>truth</b> <b>table.</b> This type is also known as Johnston diagram. Another way of representing sets is with John F. Randolph's R-diagrams.|$|E
25|$|Example 6. Periodic {{sequence}} with {{period a}} power of two. This is a proper subalgebra of Example 5 (a proper subalgebra equals the intersection of itself with its algebra). These {{can be understood as}} the finitary operations, with the first period of such a sequence giving the <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> of the operation it represents. For example, the <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> of x0 in the table of binary operations, namely 2f10, has period 2 (and so can be recognized as using only the first variable) even though 12 of the binary operations have period 4. When the period is 2n the operation only depends on the first n variables, the sense in which the operation is finitary. This example is also a countably infinite atomless Boolean algebra. Hence Example 5 is isomorphic to a proper subalgebra of itself! Example 6, and hence Example 5, constitutes the free Boolean algebra on countably many generators, meaning the Boolean algebra of all finitary operations on a countably infinite set of generators or variables.|$|E
25|$|Logic is {{the study}} of the {{principles}} of valid reasoning and inference, as well as of consistency, soundness, and completeness. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in intuitionistic logic) Peirce's law (((P→Q)→P)→P) is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a <b>truth</b> <b>table.</b> The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic, and has applications to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.|$|E
30|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>tables</b> {{showing the}} {{equivalence}} {{of the sequence}} of operations to NAND are shown in Fig.  5 e.|$|R
25|$|These {{definitions}} {{give rise}} to the following <b>truth</b> <b>tables</b> giving the values of these operations for all four possible inputs.|$|R
25|$|Alternatively {{the values}} of x∧y, x∨y, and ¬x can be {{expressed}} by tabulating their values with <b>truth</b> <b>tables</b> as follows.|$|R
25|$|The n-ary Boolean {{operations}} themselves {{constitute a}} power set algebra 2W, namely when W {{is taken to}} be the set of 2n valuations of the n inputs. In terms of the naming system of operations n'f'i where i in binary is a column of a <b>truth</b> <b>table,</b> the columns can be combined with Boolean operations of any arity to produce other columns present in the table. That is, we can apply any Boolean operation of arity m to m Boolean operations of arity n to yield a Boolean operation of arity n, for any m and n.|$|E
25|$|After the Karnaugh map {{has been}} constructed, {{it is used}} to find one of the {{simplest}} possible forms — a canonical form — for the information in the <b>truth</b> <b>table.</b> Adjacent 1s in the Karnaugh map represent opportunities to simplify the expression. The minterms ('minimal terms') for the final expression are found by encircling groups of 1s in the map. Minterm groups must be rectangular and must have an area that is a power of two (i.e., 1,2,4,8…). Minterm rectangles should be as large as possible without containing any 0s. Groups may overlap in order to make each one larger. The optimal groupings in the example below are marked by the green, red and blue lines, and the red and green groups overlap. The red group is a 2×2 square, the green group is a 4×1 rectangle, and the overlap area is indicated in brown.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> {{reduction}} or a weak <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> reduction must present {{all of its}} oracle queries at {{the same}} time. In a <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> reduction, the reduction also gives a boolean function (a <b>truth</b> <b>table)</b> which, when given {{the answers to the}} queries, will produce the final answer of the reduction. In a weak <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> reduction, the reduction uses the oracle answers as a basis for further computation depending on the given answers (but not using the oracle). Equivalently, a weak <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> reduction is one for which the use of the reduction is bounded by a computable function. For this reason, weak <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> reductions are sometimes called [...] "bounded Turing" [...] reductions.|$|E

30|$|When doing {{exploratory}} analysis, {{one could}} use the above indexes to assess the necessity and sufficiency of one explanatory condition. However, when analysing multiple conjectural causes, one needs to build <b>truth</b> <b>tables</b> based on consistency, which present the connections between the combinations of explanatory conditions and the outcome, and then use a Boolean minimization algorithm to simplify the <b>truth</b> <b>tables</b> so as to reveal the causal paths leading to the result (Ragin 2008).|$|R

2500|$|If {{a formula}} is a tautology, {{then there is}} a <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> for it which shows that each {{valuation}} yields the value true for the formula. Consider such a valuation. By mathematical induction on the length of the subformulas, show that the truth or falsity of the subformula follows from the truth or falsity (as appropriate for the valuation) of each propositional variable in the subformula. Then combine the lines of the <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> together two at a time by using [...] "( [...] is true implies [...] ) implies (( [...] is false implies [...] ) implies [...] )". Keep repeating this until all dependencies on propositional variables have been eliminated. The result is that we have proved the given tautology. Since every tautology is provable, the logic is complete.|$|E
2500|$|More {{generally}} one may complement any of {{the eight}} subsets of the three ports of either an AND or OR gate. The resulting sixteen possibilities give rise to only eight Boolean operations, namely those with an odd number of 1's in their <b>truth</b> <b>table.</b> There are eight such because the [...] "odd-bit-out" [...] can be either 0 or 1 and can go in any of four positions in the <b>truth</b> <b>table.</b> There being sixteen binary Boolean operations, this must leave eight operations with an even number of 1's in their truth tables. Two of these are the constants 0 and 1 (as binary operations that ignore both their inputs); four are the operations that depend nontrivially on exactly one of their two inputs, namely x, y, ¬x, and ¬y; and the remaining two are x⊕y (XOR) and its complement x≡y.|$|E
2500|$|... (ii) [...] The j-th {{column in}} the right half of the table is the binary {{representation}} of j, again in little-endian order. In effect the subscript of the operation is the <b>truth</b> <b>table</b> of that operation. By analogy with Gödel numbering of computable functions one might call this numbering of the Boolean operations the Boole numbering.|$|E
