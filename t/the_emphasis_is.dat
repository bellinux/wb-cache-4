5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Snake Eater {{is similar}} to that of previous games in the Metal Gear Solid series. Snake, controlled by the player, must move undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment. Although Snake acquires various weapons (ranging from handguns to rocket propelled grenades), <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on using stealth to avoid confrontations. A number of objects and gadgets can be found along the way to aid in this, including motion detectors to track hostile soldiers, and the Metal Gear series' trademark cardboard box, which Snake can hide under to avoid visual detection.|$|E
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on treating {{this with}} diuretics {{to reduce the}} circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene was}} a plain, bare, {{monotonous}} vault of a school-room, and the speaker's square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence {{with a line}} on the schoolmaster's sleeve. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> helped by <b>the</b> speaker's square wall of a forehead, which had his eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves, overshadowed by <b>the</b> wall. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> helped by <b>the</b> speaker's mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> helped by <b>the</b> speaker's voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> helped by <b>the</b> speaker's hair, which bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside. The speaker's obstinate carriage, square coat, square legs, square shoulders, - nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it was, - all helped <b>the</b> <b>emphasis.</b>|$|R

5|$|Major {{memorial}} themes, such as {{victory and}} death all had their symbols. Many Canadian and British soldiers are shown raising a hat or a rifle, {{a sign of}} victory first introduced into Boer War memorials. The Greek goddess Nike herself frequently appears on civic memorials, particularly in Britain and Canada, personifying victory, often pointing the way to soldiers: the image is far less, common, however, on more sombre memorials in battlefields and graveyards. Personifications of Death rarely feature on these memorials, however, probably because <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> typically on the self-sacrifice of the soldiers involved, rather than their being taken or claimed by Death. Death is more typically presented through images of widows, orphans and elderly parents on memorials, all popular inter-war allegorical forms for death and grieving. Figures of women often represented peace, civilisation or wider humanity.|$|E
5|$|The kulintang {{repertoire}} has no fixed labels {{because the}} music {{itself is not}} considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always {{in a state of}} flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the labels they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on the excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the labels attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.|$|E
5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E

25|$|In any {{study of}} Angkorian architecture, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> {{necessarily}} on religious architecture, {{since all the}} remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature. During the period of Angkor, only temples and other religious buildings were constructed of stone. Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were constructed of perishable materials such as wood, and so have not survived.|$|E
25|$|The Nritta {{performance}} is abstract, fast and rhythmic {{aspect of the}} dance. The viewer is presented with pure movement in Nritta, wherein <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{history of the}} United States is about characteristics of and important developments in the U.S. economy from colonial times to the present. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on economic performance {{and how it was}} affected by new technologies, the change of size in economic sectors and the effects of legislation and government policy. Specialized business history is covered in American business history.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} three centuries <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> veneration of martyrs, as a {{continuation}} of the yearly celebrations of their death, e.g. as noted in the early Christian text on the Martyrdom of Polycarp.|$|R
50|$|The Christian Church {{performed}} {{marriages in}} the narthex {{of the church}} prior to the 16th century, when <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> marital contract and betrothal. Subsequently, the ceremony moved inside the sacristy of the church.|$|R

25|$|Theravāda orthodoxy {{takes the}} seven stages of {{purification}} {{as the basic}} outline of the path to be followed. This basic outline {{is based on the}} threefold discipline of sīla (ethics or discipline), samādhi (meditative concentration) and paññā (understanding or wisdom). <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on understanding the three marks of existence, which removes ignorance. Understanding destroys the ten fetters and leads to nibbana.|$|E
25|$|Hunting scenes, {{especially}} those {{set in the}} enclosed vista of the reed beds of the Nile Delta from Ancient Egypt, can give {{a strong sense of}} place, but <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. The frescos from the Tomb of Nebamun, now in the British Museum (c. 1350 BC), are a famous example.|$|E
25|$|Type A1 {{is without}} lights and sirens Type A2 with lights and sirens and can {{function}} as emergency ambulances.
