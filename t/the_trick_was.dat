5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
25|$|Cruyff Turn (Cruijff Turn), a {{dribbling}} trick perfected by Cruyff. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> famously {{employed by}} Cruyff in the 1974 World Cup, first {{seen in the}} Dutch match against Sweden and soon widely emulated.|$|E
25|$|Mawari-butai (revolving stage) {{developed}} in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The kuraten (“darkened revolve”) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for akaten (“lighted revolve”), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early eighteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|The highest card of <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> Boss card. (e.g. if <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> K, 4, 7, Q, 3 - players {{state that}} <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> [...] "K-boss") ...|$|R

50|$|The Dragon {{may only}} be played in a single card <b>trick.</b> <b>The</b> player wins <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> unless <b>the</b> Dragon <b>is</b> bombed. If <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> won with <b>the</b> Dragon, <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> given to your {{opponent}} (you choose which one). Furthermore, if the dragon is bombed, the player who played the largest bomb on <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> takes <b>the</b> entire <b>trick</b> for themselves (which includes the dragon).|$|R
25|$|While each playwright {{will take}} {{his or her}} own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who {{undertook}} and completed this task for Timon of Athens felt that <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to leave what is immediate and alive to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere to unpack whatever might hinder the free flow of the story {{in a way that is}} clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{itself was}} smaller in scale when {{compared}} to the Battle of Ticinus. Although Fabius was not duped by Hannibal’s moves, his blocking force at the pass was. Leonard Cottrell, in his book “Hannibal: Enemy of Rome", wrote that <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> designed to be recognized by Fabius as a trick. Hannibal had studied the mind of his opponent, and devised a plan to make him do exactly what Hannibal needed him to do. Fabius thought Hannibal was {{trying to get him to}} fight a night action over broken, uneven ground, where Roman infantry would lose their greatest advantages of discipline and teamwork, as their formations would become disorganized. Since Hannibal was choosing the battle ground and the hour, he might have sprung other surprises to gain further advantages on the Romans. Fabius predictably did what Hannibal had anticipated: nothing. The Romans guarding the pass, with no Fabius to keep them in check, thought they were doing their job when they rushed out, preventing a Carthaginian escape. Again, they acted as Hannibal had anticipated, and the Carthaginians took advantage of their actions to escape.|$|E
500|$|Remembering his {{experience}} with Shaoweng, the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da; he requested the mystic to display his power. Luan Da set down a chess board and, while chanting, caused the chess pieces to charge at one another. The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> achieved by coating the pieces {{in a mixture of}} rooster's blood, iron shavings, and [...] "magnetic dust". In Science and Civilisation in China (1986), Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used: powdered magnetite would not have been very effective.|$|E

5000|$|An [...] "ollie impossible" [...] {{involves}} the vertical 360-degree {{rotation of the}} board around the skater's back or front foot—the board rolls around the foot similar to the spinning of a baton around one's hand. A proficient ollie impossible is executed when {{the rotation of the}} board is as vertical as possible, whereby the board wraps around the foot. When <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> executed with <b>the</b> front foot, <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> named a [...] "front-foot impossible". In a [...] "trick tip" [...] video presented by professional skateboarder Lee Yankou, <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> described as a [...] "scooping motion", rather than a <b>trick</b> that <b>is</b> launched with the execution of an ollie.|$|R
5000|$|The board spins 360 degrees, {{while the}} rider spins 180 {{degrees in the}} same direction; {{sometimes}} <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> combined with a kickflip—a <b>trick</b> that has <b>been</b> named the [...] "bigspin flip"—or it is combined with a heelflip, a <b>trick</b> that has <b>been</b> named the [...] "bigspin heel". <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> named after Brian Lotti, whose name sounds like [...] "lottery"—his friend named <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> after <b>the</b> California Lottery's [...] "Big Spin" [...] game.|$|R
500|$|A {{dish that}} succeeded to puzzle or {{surprise}} the diners {{was considered the}} greatest achievement of culinary sophistication. The [...] "secrets", divulged {{at the end of}} each chapter, provide examples of such recipes. One is for a capon in a bottle; <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to skin the bird, place the skin inside a bottle, fill it with a mixture of milk and eggs, and put the bottle into boiling water. As the mixture expanded in heat, it produced an illusion of a whole capon fit inside a bottle. Another [...] "secret" [...] is a recipe for an uncut pike with its head fried, its tail baked and its middle boiled; it was made by spit-roasting the fish while basting its head with oil or butter and sprinkling it with flour, and pouring salted vinegar on cloth wrapped around the middle part. The last recipe is for a broth boiled with a string of pearls and a golden coin, which was supposed to cure the sick and those [...] "despairing about their health".|$|E
500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. In a 2010 {{review of the}} episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "Grade A" [...] rating. He noted {{the difference between the}} style of the episode and previous stories of the series, saying that at first, it [...] "feel like it might be a very special Murder, She Wrote or something," [...] and that later, [...] "we're clearly in some other show entirely, the only links in the continuity chain being Mulder and Scully themselves." [...] Including Morgan's other scripts for the show, VanDerWerff called his writing [...] "deeply, deeply funny", but said that [...] "Humbug" [...] "may be [...] weakest script". He particularly praised the ending of the episode, saying [...] "there are few other TV writers that would come up with something as haunting and as perfectly understanding of the human condition as the final reveal of who the killer is." [...] Also writing for The A.V. Club in 2010, Zack Handlen called it [...] "a terrific episode ... well-written and odd". Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called [...] "Humbug" [...] "the pivotal episode of The X-Files." [...] Robert Goodwin said of the episode [...] "Talk about offbeat. It's very theatrical and grandiose. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> being careful that it didn't become like a bad Vincent Price movie, but it worked out well." [...] Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Reviewers for website IGN named [...] "Humbug" [...] the tenth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series. Topless Robot named it the sixth funniest episode of the series.|$|E

2500|$|A contact while moving {{was always}} possible. However, {{offensive}} action usually took two forms: either {{an attack on}} a camp, or an ambush. The tactic for dealing with a camp was to get a party behind it then charge the front. However, ambushes were probably the most effective tactic and could be sustained for many days. They targeted tracks and, particularly in parts of Borneo, waterways. Track ambushes were close range, , with a killing zone typically [...] long, depending on the expected strength of the target. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to remain undetected when the target entered the ambush area and then open fire all together at the right moment.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} Crooks, Crux, Pointer Grind, or the K-grind {{after the man}} to whom <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> most {{commonly}} accredited, Eric Koston.

2500|$|Gibson {{performed}} in The Hazards of Helen for 69 episodes until the series ended in February 1917, after which Kalem tried producing another serial The Daughter of Daring, with {{a starring role}} for her. [...] One of her best stunts appeared in this serial: traveling at full speed on a motorcycle chasing after a runaway freight train, Gibson rode through a wooden gate, shattering it completely, up a station platform, and through the open doors of a boxcar on a siding, with her machine traveling through the air until it landed on a flatcar in a passing train. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to undercrank the camera and execute it all with flawless timing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{innovation}} that met the room temperature challenge was the double heterostructure laser. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to quickly move the wafer in the LPE apparatus between different [...] "melts" [...] of aluminum gallium arsenide (p- and n-type) {{and a third}} melt of gallium arsenide. It {{had to be done}} rapidly since the gallium arsenide core region needed to be significantly under 1µm in thickness. The first laser diode to achieve continuous wave operation was a double heterostructure demonstrated in 1970 essentially simultaneously by Zhores Alferov and collaborators (including Dmitri Z. Garbuzov) of the Soviet Union, and Morton Panish and Izuo Hayashi working in the United States. However, it is widely accepted that Zhores I. Alferov and team reached the milestone first.|$|E

2500|$|Yashin {{would always}} organise the {{defensive}} {{game of his}} team, often so fiercely that even his wife accused him of yelling {{too much on the}} pitch. He rarely captained his teams, as the accepted custom of appointing a goalkeeper captain was virtually unheard-of in that era, but his leadership on the field was always evident. Yashin was one of the goalkeepers that began the practice of punching balls out in difficult situations instead of trying to catch them. Other novel practices he developed were the quick throw of the ball to begin a counterattack, coming out of the penalty area to anticipate danger, and the command and organisation of the defenders – practices now quite common among goalkeepers. When asked what his secret was, he would reply that <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> [...] "to have a smoke to calm your nerves, then toss back a strong drink to tone your muscles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doyle was {{friends for}} a time with Harry Houdini, the American magician who himself became a {{prominent}} opponent of the Spiritualist movement in the 1920s {{following the death of}} his beloved mother. Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers—a view expressed in Doyle's The Edge of the Unknown. Houdini was apparently unable to convince Doyle that his feats were simply illusions, leading to a bitter public falling out between the two. [...] A specific incident is recounted in memoirs by Houdini's friend Bernard M. L. Ernst, in which Houdini performed an impressive trick at his home in the presence of Conan Doyle. Houdini assured Conan Doyle <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> pure illusion and that he was attempting to prove a point about Doyle not [...] "endorsing phenomena" [...] simply because he had no explanation.

2500|$|The common shell {{consisted}} of a hollowed-out cast-iron ball that was filled with gunpowder. Each shell had a fuse [...] long that was cut by gunners to varying lengths according to the range. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> to cut the fuse so that the shell exploded at the target. If a fuse was cut too short the shell would burst in the air harmlessly. If the fuse was cut too long it would roll around sputtering, and there were incidents where soldiers snuffed out the fuse. An exploding shell had a kill zone of about [...] but was less effective on soft, wet ground. The fuse was designed to ignite when the howitzer was fired. A shell fired {{from a distance of}} 1,000 paces at an elevation of 25° could be expected to strike within an area 25 paces wide and 50 paces long about 50% of the time.
