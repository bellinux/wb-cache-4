5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E

5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

Following the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715, the court of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans made the sparkling version of Champagne a favorite among the French nobility.

Towards {{the close of the}} year, he returned to Kassel, where his mother and Wilhelm had settled, the latter having finished his studies. The next year, he obtained a position in the war office with the very small salary of 100 thalers. One of his grievances was that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and pigtail. But he had full leisure for the pursuit of his studies.|$|E
25|$|Samuel ben Meir, {{brother of}} Jacob ben Meir, argued that infused tastes could endure in a cooking vessel or utensil {{for up to}} 24 hours; his {{suggestion}} led to the principle, known as ben yomo (Hebrew: son of the day, בן יומו), that vessels and utensils {{should not be used}} to cook milk within 24 hours of being used to cook meat (and vice versa). Although, after 24 hours, some residual flavour may still reside in porous cooking vessels and utensils, some rabbis hold the opinion that such residue would become stale and fetid, hence only infusing <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> worse (Hebrew: nosen taam lifgam, נותן טעם לפגם), which they do not regard as violating the ban against mixing the tastes of milk and meat.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} present a model of {{occupational}} choice in which the agents are uncertain about their wage within the occupation. Agents are assumed to know their own stock of human capital {{and the distribution of}} wages per unit of human capital in the occupation at the time of initial labor market entry. The agents decide which occupation to select based on their expected utility from each occupation, given <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> future consumption, <b>the</b> available stock of human capital, <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> occupation, the costs of entry into the occupation, <b>the</b> assets available <b>for</b> consumption, <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> risk, and <b>the</b> distribution of wages within each occupation. By specifying the form of the utility function, we can derive estimable equations relating the probability of choosing an occupation, i, to the moments of the distribution of wages and the past accumulations of human capital. By imposing appropriate restrictions on the parameters of the model, both within equations and across equations, all the parameters of the structural model underlying the occupational choice may be derived...|$|R

25|$|Byzantine dress changed {{considerably}} {{over the}} {{thousand years of}} the Empire, but was essentially conservative. The Byzantines liked color and pattern, and made and exported very richly patterned cloth, especially Byzantine silk, woven and embroidered for the upper classes, and resist-dyed and printed for the lower. A different border or trimming round the edges was very common, and many single stripes down the body or around the upper arm are seen, often denoting class or rank. <b>Taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> middle and upper classes followed the latest fashions at the Imperial Court. As in the West during the Middle Ages, clothing was very expensive for the poor, who probably wore the same well-worn clothes nearly all the time; this meant in particular that any costume owned by most women needed to fit throughout the full term of a pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The Drumcree conflict, {{stemming}} from an Orange Order protest at Drumcree Church after their parade had been banned from marching through the predominantly nationalist Catholic Garvaghy area of Portadown, {{returned to the}} headlines in 1995 with trouble expected in Wright's Portadown stronghold. Just before the July marching season Irish government representative Fergus Finlay held a meeting with Wright in which the latter pledged his loyalty {{to the peace process}} and David Ervine in particular, although Wright also warned Finlay that loyalist views had to be respected. Cracks began to show however as Wright felt that the UVF response to the trouble had been inordinately low-key whilst his <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) strategy also began to wane as the party moved increasingly towards a form of socialism, an ideology repugnant to Wright. A further problem arose when Wright, who by that time was a popular loyalist figure across Northern Ireland, travelled to the Shankill Road in Belfast in late 1995 to try to overturn a ban preventing an Orange Order parade entering a neighbouring Catholic area. Wright had hoped to bring local UVF units onto the streets of the Shankill to force an overturning of the ban but the Shankill commanders refused to put their units at Wright's disposal, having assured the British authorities that they would not in a series of secret negotiations. Wright returned to Portadown in disgust, accusing the Belfast UVF of having surrendered. Nonetheless, when Wright was arrested in late 1995 for intimidation he was still on good terms with the UVF, whose magazine Combat called for his release.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} that allows one to model the optimal bundling problem of a multiproduct monopolist providing interrelated goods with an arbitrary degree of complementarity or substitutability. Characterizations of optimal bundling strategies are derived <b>for</b> <b>the</b> seller {{in the case of}} long-tailed valuations and <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> products. We show, in particular, that if goods provided in a Vickrey auction or any other revenue equivalent auction are substitutes and bidders' <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> objects are not extremely heavy-tailed, then the monopolist prefers separate provision of the products. However, if the goods are complements and consumers' tastes are extremely thick- tailed, then the seller prefers providing the products on a single auction. We also present results on consumers' preferences over bundled auctions in the case when their valuations exhibit heavy-tailedness. In addition, we obtain characterizations of optimal bundling strategies for a monopolist who provides complements or substitutes for profit maximizing prices to buyers with long-tailed tastes. ...|$|R

500|$|Around {{the time}} I Vampiri was in development, Italian film {{productions}} had grown exponentially. Italian film productions rose from 25 films in 1945, to 204 in 1954. This growth allowed film makers in Italy to approach new genres and new styles not attempted before. In 1956, {{the chief executive}} officer of Titanus, Goffredo Lombardo, stated that Italian film productions should be aimed a European market opposed to just an Italian one. During the production of the film Beatrice Cenci (1956), director Riccardo Freda and his friend, cinematographer Mario Bava discussed the idea of developing a horror film. Horror films had been previously banned in Italy during the 1930s and 1940s, while a new <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> macabre was developing.
