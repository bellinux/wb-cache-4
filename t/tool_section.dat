40|$|Range {{optimization}} {{is one of}} {{the tasks}} associated with the development of cost- effective, stand-off, air-to-surface munitions systems. The search for the optimal input parameters that will result in the maximum achievable range often employ conventional Monte Carlo techniques. Monte Carlo approaches can be time-consuming, costly, and insensitive to mutually dependent parameters and epistatic parameter effects. An alternative search and optimization technique is available in genetic algorithms. In the experiments discussed in this report, a simplified platform motion simulator was the fitness function for a genetic algorithm. The parameters to be optimized were the inputs to this motion generator and the simulator`s output (terminal range) was the fitness measure. The parameters of interest were initial launch altitude, initial launch speed, wing angle-of-attack, and engine ignition time. The parameter values the GA produced were validated by Monte Carlo investigations employing a full-scale six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) simulation. The best results produced by Monte Carlo processes using values based on the GA derived parameters were within - 1 % of the ranges generated by the simplified model using the evolved parameter values. This report has five sections.

' In particular, the article examines the MEO lobbying efforts to expand national trademark and unfair competition systems to include an event organizer right of association. In order to present ambush marketing as an advertising <b>tool,</b> <b>Section</b> 2 begins by giving examples of ambush marketing methods, i. e. competitive marketing techniques regularly employed by nonsponsor businesses around mega-events. Section 2 then goes on to define ambush marketing in light of these selected examples, existing law and an event organizer right of association. Section 3 introduces approaches MEOs have developed and implemented to reduce the avenues open to, and supposed detrimental effects of, ambush marketing {{in the absence of an}} event organizer right of association. A review of these strategies helps to contextualize the perceived need to expand legal systems to include an event organizer right of association. Section 4 provides a survey of the sui generis protection regimes a growing number of countries have enacted so as to shield MEOs and their corporate sponsors from the alleged ill-effects of ambush marketing. Section 5 concludes by critiquing the introduction of such laws from both a legal and a policy perspective. It is argued that the danger at play here is not so-called ambush marketing; instead, the real threat is posed by the MEO frontal attack on competitive advertising practices...|$|E

We describe {{the differences between}} the two and explain the new features, some of which are not (yet) available in any other termination tool, in some detail. T_ T is a tool for automatically proving termination of rewrite systems based on the dependency pair method of Arts and Giesl [3]. It produces high-quality output and has a convenient web interface. The tool is available at [URL] T_ T incorporates several new improvements to the dependency pair method. In addition, it is now possible to run the tool in fully automatic mode on a collection of rewrite systems. Moreover, besides ordinary (first-order) rewrite systems, the tool accepts simply-typed applicative rewrite systems which are transformed into ordinary rewrite systems by the recent method of Aoto and Yamada [2].
