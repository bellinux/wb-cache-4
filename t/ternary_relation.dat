40|$|The {{notion of}} a {{relational}} grammar is extended to <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> and illustrated by a fragment of English. Some of Peirce's terms for <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> are shown to be incorrect and corrected. Binary relations have been studied extensively by Peirce and Schroder in the nineteenth century, and in this century by Tarski and his students. No comparable {{attention has been paid}} to <b>ternary</b> <b>relations.</b> This is surprising, for Peirce had already dealt with <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> on various occasions. But Schroder strictly confined himself to binary relations, and it is the topic of binary relations that has become the focus of interest for Tarski and his students. For notable exceptions see Carnap (1929), Copi and Harary (1953), and Aubert (1955) and the theory of relational database systems. Peirce has illustrated his ternary relational terms by natural language examples. For instance, the equation (b a) m = b (am) where b = betray, a = enemy, and m = man was explained in English as follo [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a two-sorted substructural logic called 'Update Logic' where the central objects of study are updates, which are represented formally by <b>ternary</b> <b>relations.</b> We develop a basic correspondence theory which relates properties of <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> with axioms and inference rules stating properties of updates. We claim that update logic can capture various logic-based formalisms dealing with belief change. As case study, {{we consider the}} logical framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) and we show that we can embed it within update logic. Also, we identify axioms and inference rules that completely characterize the DEL product update. Moreover, we introduce Gentzen calculi which extend Gentzen calculi for modal logic and which axiomatize our update logic and DEL. Our completeness proof techniques are new compared to the standard proof techniques used to prove completeness of Gentzen calculi. Our contributions to proof theory are independent from our contributions {{to the study of}} logical dynamics and can also be read independently...|$|R
40|$|Models of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR), built {{according}} to the "make only as many distinctions as necessary" belief, partition the universe of values into {{a finite number of}} regions; elements lying in a same region are qualitatively equal, i. e., indistinguishable. The purpose of this work is not to tackle the foundational arguments of QSR, in which I strongly believe; rather, I believe as well that some application domains need a representational model based on a partition of the universe of values as fine-grained as possible: that is to say, a quantitative model. I investigate such a model, which is a constraint-based model of <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> on triples of 2 D points; a relation of the model describes the relative, quantitative, orientation of its three arguments.

In nonconflict problems, weights or distances varied, while the other was held constant.

In Experiment 3, 3 - and 4 -year-olds succeeded on all except conflict balance problems, while 5 - and 6 -year-olds succeeded on all problem types.

Tasks from six domains (transitivity, hierarchical classification, class inclusion, cardinality, relative-clause sentence comprehension, and hypothesis testing) were administered to children aged 3 - 8 years. Complexity analyses indicated that the domains entailed <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> (three variables). Simpler binary-relation (two variables) items were included for each domain. Thus RC was manipulated with other factors tightly controlled. Results indicated that (i) ternary-relation items were more difficult than comparable binary-relation items, (ii) the RC manipulation was sensitive to age-related changes, (iii) <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> were processed at a median age of 5 years, (iv) cross-task correlations were positive, with all tasks loading on a single factor (RC), (v) RC factor scores accounted for 80 % (88 %) of age-related variance in fluid intelligence (compositionality of sets), (vi) binary- and ternary-relation items formed separate complexity classes, and (vii) the RC approach to defining cognitive complexity is applicable to different content domains.

Mostly, such data consist of unstruc-tured texts, which often contain {{references}} to structured in-formation (e. g., person names, contact records, etc.). In this work, we propose a novel solution to discover social events from actual press news edited by humans. Con-cretely, our method is divided in two steps, each one ad-dressing a specific Information Extraction (IE) task: first, we use a technique to automatically recognize four classes of named-entities from press news: Date, Location, Pla-ce, and Artist. Furthermore, we detect social events by extracting <b>ternary</b> <b>relations</b> between such entities, also ex-ploiting evidence from external sources (i. e., the Web). Fi-nally, we evaluate both stages of our proposed solution on a real-world dataset. Experimental results highlight the qual-ity of our first-step Named-Entity Recognition (NER) ap-proach, which indeed performs consistently with state-of-the-art solutions. Eventually, we show how to precisely se-lect true events from the list of all candidate events (i. e., all the <b>ternary</b> <b>relations),</b> which result from our second-step Relation Extraction (RE) method. Indeed, we discover that true social events can be detected if enough evidence of those is found in the result list of Web search engines...|$|R
