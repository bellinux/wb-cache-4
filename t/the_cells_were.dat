5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research.

5|$|By 1935, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} {{several hundred}} men—the figures range from 200 to 800—organized in cells of five men, and arranged military training for peasants. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> equipped with bombs and firearms, which {{they used to}} raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British-constructed rail lines. Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass, al-Qassam's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force, Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.|$|E

25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E

25|$|Endospores {{can stay}} dormant {{for a very}} long time. For instance, endospores were found in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs.

In 1995, Raul Cano of California Polytechnic State University found bacterial spores in the gut of a fossilized bee trapped in amber from a tree in the Dominican Republic. The bee fossilized in amber was dated to being about 25 million years old. The spores germinated when the amber was cracked open and the material from the gut of the bee was extracted and placed in nutrient medium.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{presenting}} multiple stimuli types such as chemical, physical, and biological cues on neural progenitor cell differentiation {{has not been}} explored. A {{study was conducted in}} which three different stimuli were presented to adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs): postnatal rat type-1 astrocytes (biological), laminin (chemical), and micropatterned substrate (physical). Over 75% of the AHPCs aligned within 20° of the grooves compared to random growth on the non-patterned substrates. When AHPCs were grown on micropatterned substrates with astrocytes, outgrowth was influenced by the astrocytes that had aligned with the grooves; namely, the AHPCs extended processes along the astrocytic cytoskeletal filaments. However, the alignment was not as significant as that seen by the AHPCs in culture alone with the micropatterned substrate. In order to assess the different phenotypes expressed as a result of differentiation, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> stained with antibodies for class III β-tubulin (TuJI), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which are markers for early neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, respectively.

25|$|Concern {{regarding}} the immunogenicity of IPS cells arose in 2011 when Zhou et al. performed a study involving a teratomaformation assay and demonstrated that IPS cells produced an immune response {{strong enough to}} cause rejection of the cells.

In 2013, Araki et al. attempted to reproduce the conclusion obtained by Zhou et al. using a different procedure. They took cells from a chimera that had been grown from IPSC clones and a mouse embryo, this tissue was then transplanted into syngenic mice. They conducted a similar trial using ES cells instead of IPSC clone and compared the results. Findings indicate {{that there was no}} significant difference in the immunogenic response produced by the IPS cells and the ES cells.

25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) have the {{capability}} to self-renew and to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages. Many culture methods have been developed for directing NSC differentiation; however, the creation of biomaterials for directing NSC differentiation is seen as a more clinically relevant and usable technology. One approach to develop a biomaterial for directing NSC differentiation is to combine extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors. A very recent study by Nakajima, Ishimuro et al. examined the effects of different molecular pairs consisting of a growth factor and an ECM component on the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes and neuronal cells. The ECM components investigated were laminin-1 and fibronectin, which are natural ECM components, and ProNectin F plus (Pro-F) and ProNectin L (Pro-L), which are artificial ECM components, and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The neurotrophic factors used were epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The pair combinations were immobilized onto matrix cell arrays, on which the NSCs were cultured. After 2 days in culture, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> stained with antibodies against nestin, β-tubulin III, and GFAP, which are markers for NSCs, neuronal cells, and astrocytes, respectively. The results provide valuable information on advantageous combinations of ECM components and growth factors as a practical method for developing a biomaterial for directing differentiation of NSCs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{description}} {{in terms of}} the continuous state leaky bucket algorithm is given by the ITU-T as follows: “The virtual scheduling algorithm updates a Theoretical Arrival Time (TAT), which is the 'nominal' arrival time of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> assuming <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> sent equally spaced at an emission interval of T corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> rate Λ 1/T when the source is active. If the actual arrival time of a <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> not 'too early' relative to the TAT and tolerance τ associated to <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> rate, i.e. if the actual arrival time is after its theoretical arrive time minus the limit value (ta > TAT - τ), then <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> conforming; otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> nonconforming" [...] If <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> nonconforming then TAT is left unchanged. If <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>is</b> conforming, and arrived before its TAT (equivalent to the bucket not being empty but being less than the limit value), then <b>the</b> next <b>cell's</b> TAT <b>is</b> simply TAT + T.
