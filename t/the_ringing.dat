5|$|On 13 June 1940 <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> {{of church}} bells was banned; {{henceforth}} {{they would only}} be rung by the military or the police to warn that an invasion—generally meaning by parachutists—was in progress.|$|E
5|$|Webb's next project, <b>The</b> <b>Ringing</b> Bell was {{released}} on May 1, 2007. Before the release date, it was available for pre-order at TheRingingBell.com in a deluxe edition which included a 96-page graphic novel inspired by the album. Those who pre-ordered the deluxe edition of the album were also able to immediately download it in its entirety.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ring</b> current creates its own {{magnetic}} field. Outside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> {{this field}} {{is in the}} same direction as the externally applied magnetic field; inside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> field counteracts the externally applied field. As a result, the net magnetic field outside <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> is greater than the externally applied field alone, and is less inside <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|As a graded Hopf algebra, {{the dual}} of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of quasisymmetric {{functions}} is <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of noncommutative symmetric functions. Every symmetric function {{is also a}} quasisymmetric function, and hence <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of symmetric functions is a subalgebra of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of quasisymmetric functions.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Gifu {{absorbed the}} former post town of Kanō, greatly {{increasing}} its land area. Kanō had many traditional industries, which helped improve Gifu's overall industrial strength. With the neighboring city of Kakamigahara {{serving as an}} aeronautics center for Japan, Gifu was a large industrial center during World War II, including a downtown manufacturing sector. As a result, Gifu {{was the target of}} heavy firebombing by the United States Army Air Forces, culminating in the Gifu Air Raid of July 9, 1945, which resulted in 1,383 casualties (863 dead, 520 injured) and 20,426 buildings affected. Gifu commemorates these events each year on July 9, with <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of the Peace Bell at each temple within the city. Its sister cities also take part in these events.|$|E
50|$|Due to a {{rotating}} hole's rotational frame-dragging effects, spacetime {{in the vicinity}} of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> will undergo curvature in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>ring's</b> motion. Effectively this means that different observers placed around a Kerr black hole who are asked to point to the hole's apparent center of gravity may point to different points on <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> Falling objects will begin to acquire angular momentum from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> before they actually strike it, and the path taken by a perpendicular light ray (initially traveling toward <b>the</b> <b>ring's</b> center) will curve in <b>the</b> direction of <b>ring</b> motion before intersecting with <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>ring's</b> {{diameter}} is reduced, {{the magnetic}} flux threading <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> represented by five field lines, {{is reduced by}} the same ratio as the area of <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> <b>The</b> variation of the magnetic flux induces a current in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> (red arrows), which in turn creates a new magnetic field, so that the total flux {{in the interior of}} <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> is maintained (four green field lines added to the five blue lines give the original nine field lines).|$|R
50|$|This {{device was}} {{fabricated}} {{a shape of}} <b>the</b> p-i-n <b>ring</b> resonator on a silicon-on-insulator substrate with a 3-mm-thick buried oxide layer. Both the waveguide coupling to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and that forming <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> have awidth of 450 nm and a height of 250 nm. The diameter of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> is 12 mm, and the spacing between <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and <b>the</b> straight waveguide is 200 nm.|$|R
5|$|The sonorous {{sound of}} the bell was also used to warn of {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of a temple bell could be heard over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows {{light the}} staircase to <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|E
5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling. The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or plastered, as slots in the {{principals}} show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476–1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete sapwood. The original ceiling can still be reached from <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof).|$|E
5000|$|In Handly Cup Style Lawn Darts, {{scores are}} based on darts in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> plus darts closer to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> {{than any of the}} {{opposing}} team's darts. Darts landing inside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> or [...] "ringers", are worth 3 points each, and can be cancelled by an opponent also throwing a dart into <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> Additionally, any dart that is closer to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> (but outside) than any other dart by the opposing team is worth one point. This means that if neither team managed to place a dart into <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> but Team A had two darts closer than any of Team B's darts, Team A would score 2 points. If Team A had one dart in <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> and one dart closer than any of Team B's darts, they would score 4 points. If both teams have darts in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> it is impossible for a dart outside <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> to score any points (as it is farther from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> than <b>the</b> opposing team's dart that is inside). If Team A and Team B each had a dart inside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> and Team A also had a dart outside <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> but closer to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> than Team B's other dart, neither team would score any points for that round. Handly Cup Style matches typically are played in teams of two, with the pairs alternating, until one team's total score is 21 or more. In addition, for a point to count the dart must stick into the ground.|$|R
50|$|If a is {{idempotent}} in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> R, then aRa {{is again}} a ring, with multiplicative identity a. <b>The</b> <b>ring</b> aRa {{is often referred}} to as a corner <b>ring</b> of R. <b>The</b> corner <b>ring</b> arises naturally since <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of endomorphisms EndR(aR) ≅ aRa.|$|R
25|$|Players are not {{permitted}} to carry <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> over <b>the</b> two blue lines; they can advance <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> over <b>the</b> line only by passing it to another player. <b>The</b> <b>ring</b> must be touched by any other player first, but {{does not need to be}} under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> off a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given a free pass. If <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> goes over both blue lines, the team that passed it may not touch it until the opposing team does or attempts to get <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other regulations were imposed, including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
5|$|The Lincoln-Liberty Building, {{completed}} in 1932, {{was intended to}} partly house a large men's department store and offices. The building's cornerstone was set on October 1, 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City, Paris and London. The Wanamaker Men's Store opened on October 12, 1932, with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of the building's Founders Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, Nevin said the new building {{was a sign of}} the store's faith that the economy would improve. Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection, the men's store ordered US$2,000,000 worth of merchandise and was the largest store {{of its kind in the}} world. As early as 1939 there were rumors the men's store would close, but Wanamaker's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space. When a new tenant was ready to take the store's place in the 1950s, the men's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street.|$|E
5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the ringed-pole surface-mounted permanent-magnet {{machine is}} {{investigated}} {{from the point}} of view of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> losses. <b>The</b> <b>rings</b> around <b>the</b> poles create a high-frequency anisotropy that is useful to detect the rotor position by means of a high-frequency signal injection. However, the presence of <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> causes additional rotor losses. <b>The</b> causes of <b>ring</b> losses are investigated in the paper. The first cause is the high-frequency signal injection itself. The harmonics in the airgap magnetomotive force, which are not synchronous with the rotor and hence induce currents in <b>the</b> <b>rings,</b> are <b>the</b> second source of losses. The third source is the airgap flux fluctuation due to stator slotting. Machines of different sizes and winding types are investigated. A finite-element analysis and an analytical model are used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> losses, comparing <b>the</b> results. The influence of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> cross-sectional area on <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> losses is analyzed, showing that <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> losses can be reduced in certain configurations...|$|R

5|$|Ten {{nations were}} {{entered in the}} tandem competition, {{and in the first}} round, they were drawn with Germany and South Africa, who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom Shardelow and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The Australians made their move too early and led at <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> of the bell {{at the start of the}} last lap, but they were {{overhauled}} well before the line as they faded in the final straight. Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day. The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance, but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish. This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated, however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle, resulting in a heavy pile-up. Neither teams finished the race, but the Soviets were hospitalised. The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against the losers in the previous repechages to qualify. This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve.|$|E

25|$|The skin is held {{in place}} by being trapped between <b>the</b> top <b>ring,</b> called <b>the</b> crown <b>ring,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> below it, called <b>the</b> flesh <b>ring.</b> A third <b>ring</b> (<b>the</b> bottom <b>ring)</b> is placed around <b>the</b> stem. <b>The</b> <b>rings</b> are {{commonly}} made from 6–8mm (¼–⅓in) rebar. A series of cow hitches on <b>the</b> crown <b>ring</b> and bottom ring form loops. Through these loops, a length of rope connects <b>the</b> crown <b>ring</b> and <b>the</b> bottom ring; tightening this rope applies tension. As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow hitches on <b>the</b> crown <b>ring</b> press <b>the</b> skin against <b>the</b> flesh <b>ring</b> below; this attaches the skin to <b>the</b> flesh <b>ring</b> very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.|$|R
50|$|Throwing one's {{opponent}} out of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> is possible, as {{is fighting}} outside of <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> but one will start after one enters.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a wrestler}} executes {{a move on}} another wrestler too close to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> ropes, they may end up {{knocking}} their opponent, or themselves, out of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> entirely. In this situation, the on-screen scene will change from an upper-view of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> to a side-view of it. The wrestler who has been knocked out has a count of 20 to re-enter <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> to avoid being counted out. Often, in the situation where the player's wrestler has been knocked out of <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> opposing wrestler will follow {{them in order to}} execute one of the 4 moves allotted in the given situation. The first 3 moves are similar to The Straight Jab and The Karate Chop, the fourth, The Corner Bar, causes the wrestler executing the move to bash his opponent's head into <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> post. Like in inside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> execution of these moves depend upon the"Action" [...] command flashing to determine who has the advantage. The purposes of these moves is to hopefully keep the wrestler from re-entering <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> in time and be counted out. The instant a player's wrestler re-enters <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> on-screen scene immediately cuts back to the original one.|$|R
25|$|By early 1795 {{a return}} {{to some form of}} religion-based faith was {{beginning}} to take shape and a law passed on 21 February 1795 legalized public worship, albeit with strict limitations. <b>The</b> <b>ringing</b> of church bells, religious processions and displays of the Christian cross were still forbidden.|$|E

25|$|Pershore Abbey has a 25 cwt ring {{of eight}} bells. <b>The</b> <b>ringing</b> room, devised {{as part of}} Scott's 1862-64 restorations, is a metal 'cage' {{suspended}} high above the chancel crossing; it is accessed by means of two stone spiral staircases, a walkway through the roof, a squeeze through a narrow passage and a see-through iron staircase.|$|E
40|$|A {{spiral wound}} {{retaining}} ring with angled ends is described. <b>The</b> <b>ring</b> is crimped {{at the same}} angle as <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> ends to maintain a constant thickness dimension. The angling of the ends of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and crimp allow the ends to be positioned closer together while maintaining enough clearance to enable insertion and removal of <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> By reducing <b>the</b> separation distance between the ends a stronger <b>ring</b> results since <b>the</b> double layer area of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> is maximized...|$|R
