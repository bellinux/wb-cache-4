5|$|Mugabe {{was opposed}} {{to the idea of}} a ceasefire, but under {{pressure}} from Machel he agreed to it. Mugabe signed the agreement, although felt cheated, remaining disappointed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces.|$|E
5|$|On Warner's {{train ride}} to Ithaca (the site of Cornell), he met Carl Johanson, then Cornell's {{football}} coach, who {{was impressed by}} Warner's weight (200 pounds). Johanson practically ordered Warner to attend practice. This happened even though Warner admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> handled a real football.|$|E

5|$|Suter and Heisman turned away. 'Can {{you beat}} that?' Suter asked the Auburn coach. Heisman didn't say anything, I guess {{he thought a}} great deal. He told me {{afterwards}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> felt so sorry for {{a man on a}} football field as he had for Suter at that moment.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Cinema Retro {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to the screening. Johnson said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> actually stepped foot in the hall during filming, {{and that this was}} the first occasion he had actually been inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E
5|$|Stivetts {{was again}} {{reserved}} by Boston, and later re-signed for $2000. Due to the Beaneaters' solid, four-man starting pitching rotation of Nichols, Klobedanz, Lewis, and rookie Vic Willis, his role {{with the team}} {{was expected to be}} as an extra outfielder. Stivetts claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> felt better in his life and his outlook on the up-coming season was positive.|$|E

50|$|Beowulf says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> {{heard of}} anyone else having such a great sea-fight as he had; and then adds {{particularly}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> heard such stories told of Unferth, {{and in fact the}} story people tell about Unferth is how he killed his brothers, for which, Beowulf predicts, Unferth will be tormented in Hell despite his cleverness. Unferth silently concedes defeat and the feast continues.|$|R
5|$|While {{lacking in}} the social qualities common to politicians, one {{characteristic}} served Goebel well in the political arenahis intellect. Goebel was well-read, and supporters and opponents both conceded that his mental prowess was impressive. Cobb concluded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been more impressed with a man's intellect {{than he had been}} with Goebel's.|$|E
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seriously considered switching parties.|$|E
5|$|Blythe further {{testified that}} he was not under the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{well known}} fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> missed a penalty kick in his {{professional}} career to date.|$|R

5|$|In June 1997, Gallagher married Meg Mathews in Las Vegas, Nevada. He {{had met her}} in 1994 {{through her}} roommate, MTV {{presenter}} Rebecca de Ruvo, whom he was dating {{at the time and}} whom he left for Mathews. Mathews gave birth to a daughter, Ana√Øs Gallagher, on 27 January 2000. Gallagher and Mathews divorced in January 2001 on grounds of his adultery with Scottish publicist Sara MacDonald. After the divorce was finalised, Gallagher admitted he had only claimed to have cheated in order to speed up the divorce process and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> actually been unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|Throughout all this, Lody's {{demeanour}} {{was relatively}} calm {{after the initial}} shock. Cheeseman observed that Lody only appeared uneasy when his notebook was being examined; the inspector later commented that Lody was not the usual class of man he was accustomed to dealing with, but admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> met a man under precisely similar circumstances. Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced {{that the man was}} German.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{what other}} great men can you equally say it?--and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never,</b> but <b>NEVER,</b> <b>had</b> a deflexion?" [...] Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.|$|R

50|$|The Khamyangs {{are also}} {{sometimes}} referred to as the Nora, although Morey notes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> heard the remaining Khamyang speakers refer to themselves as Nora.|$|R
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City to the effect <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> advocated {{the use of the}} ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E

5|$|In 1258, Henry faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown {{about the way}} the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite {{were discovered}} in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found {{to belong to the}} same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, Metcalfe {{served on}} a House {{committee}} that investigated allegations that Vice-President John C. Calhoun had improperly benefited from a contract he awarded while serving as Secretary of War in 1822. While Calhoun was cleared of any wrongdoing, his friend, South Carolina Representative George McDuffie, began an exchange of correspondence with Metcalfe regarding the proceedings. The correspondence became heated, and McDuffie challenged Metcalfe to a duel. As {{the recipient of the}} challenge, Metcalfe had the right to choose the terms of the engagement. He chose rifles as the weapon at a distance of 90 feet. McDuffie insisted that wounds from a previous duel had left him incapable of handling a rifle, and proposed pistols as an alternative. Metcalfe replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> handled a pistol in his life. Unable to come to an agreement on the conditions of the duel, both sides eventually dropped the matter entirely.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins has distanced {{himself from}} Enron and Skilling, saying that Skilling {{misunderstood}} his book. Dawkins <b>has</b> said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> advocated selfishness {{as a means of}} progression.|$|R
