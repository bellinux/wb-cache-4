50|$|Transmission is {{a choice}} of either three-speed {{automatic}} or six-speed sequential gearbox. The three-speed TH400 gearbox predates the Baja 1000 but remains popular amongst competitors due to the long gear ratios and capability of handling the <b>torque</b> <b>spikes</b> caused by off-road racing. The six-speed sequential gearbox appeals to competitors due to the ease of changing gear ratios quickly.|$|R

Buck converters are used to power the motors, additional boost converters are {{to be used for}} regenerative braking. Use of PID regulator with current feedback for individual motors is proposed to avoid dangerous current levels and <b>torque</b> <b>spikes.</b> Step-response simulations are done to verify PID performance.

40|$|Large civil tiltrotors {{have been}} {{identified}} to replace regional airliners over medium ranges to alleviate next-generation air traffic. Variable rotor speed for these vehicles is required for efficient high-speed operation. Two-speed drive system research has been performed to support these advanced rotorcraft applications. Experimental tests were performed on two promising two-speed transmission configurations. The offset compound gear (OCG) transmission and the dual star/idler (DSI) planetary transmission were tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center variable-speed transmission test facility. Both configurations were inline devices with concentric {{input and output shafts}} and designed to provide 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 output speed reduction ratios. Both were designed for 200 hp and 15, 000 rpm input speed and had a dry shift clutch configuration. Shift tests were performed on the transmissions at input speeds of 5, 000, 8, 000, 10, 000, 12, 500, and 15, 000 rpm. Both the OCG and DSI configurations successfully perform speed shifts at full rated 15, 000 rpm input speed. The transient shifting behavior of the OCG and DSI configurations were very similar. The shift clutch had more of an effect on shifting dynamics than the reduction gearing configuration itself since the same shift clutch was used in both configurations. For both OCG and DSI configurations, low-to-high speed shifts were limited in applied torque levels in order to prevent overloads on the transmission due to transient <b>torque</b> <b>spikes.</b> It is believed that the relative lack of appreciable slippage of the dry shifting clutch at operating conditions and pressure profiles tested was a major cause of the transient <b>torque</b> <b>spikes.</b> For the low-to-high speed shifts, the output speed ramp-up time slightly decreased and the peak out torque slightly increased as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased. This was caused by slightly less clutch slippage as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased...|$|R
40|$|A key aspect in Attitude and Orbital Control Systems (AOCS) is {{the ability}} to estimateaccurately a spacecraft’s {{attitude}} and angular rate. While a classic gyrometer and star-trackerhybridization features high performances, gyroless solutions using only star-trackers as attitudesensors are often chosen to reduce the mission’s cost, when possible. Such an estimation is improvedusing the knowledge of the torque commanded by the spacecraft’s reaction wheels. The torqueestimate is however imperfect, mostly due to friction occurring on the wheels’ shafts. This paperpresents the research undertaken to improve this knowledge by adding a secondary torqueestimator to an existing gyroless estimator. An additional filter is developed for that matter, tuned,and the global AOCS performance is tested in diverse operating conditions to assess the newmethod’s benefits. While converged state performances are not improved, this solution is shown tomake the estimator more robust to friction <b>torque</b> <b>spikes</b> occurring on some reaction wheels, and toimprove settling performances after spacecraft manoeuvers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work accomplished through computer simulation {{to understand the}} impact of the hydromechanical turbine assembly (TA) fuel control on rocket gas ingestion induced engine surges on the AH- 1 (Cobra) helicopter. These surges excite the lightly damped torsional modes of the Cobra rotor drive train and can cause overtorqueing of the tail rotor shaft. The simulation studies show that the hydromechanical TA control has a negligible effect on drive train resonances because its response is sufficiently attenuated at the resonant frequencies. However, a digital electronic control working through the TA control's separate, emergency fuel metering system has been identified as a solution to the overtorqueing problem. State-of-the-art software within the electronic control can provide active damping of the rotor drive train to eliminate excessive <b>torque</b> <b>spikes</b> due to any disturbances including engine surges and aggressive helicopter maneuvers. Modifications to the existing TA hydromechanical control are relatively minor, and existing engine sensors can be utilized by the electronic control. Therefore, it is concluded that the combination of full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) with hydromechanical backup using the existing TA control enhances flight safety, improves helicopter performance, reduces pilot workload, and provides a substantial payback for very little investment...|$|R
40|$|Scanning Equipment {{supporting}} the Millimeter Wave Radiometer Instrument (MWRI) are flying in a sunsynchronized orbit of 850 -km altitude with an inclination of 98. 8 deg on the FY- 3 meteorological satellite (FY = Feng Yun, Wind and Cloud). MWRI is a linearly polarized, ten-channel passive Radiometer; it measures precipitation and water clouds, sea ice, snow/water equivalent, drought and flood index, land temperature and soil moisture. Following the FY 3 -A, the FY 3 -B Satellite {{was launched in}} autumn 2010. Since that time, the Scanning Equipment was continuously operated. During the last {{three and a half}} years in orbit, the Scanning Mechanism has executed about 65 million revolutions, while the Scan Compensation Mechanism (SCM) - used for momentum compensation - has already successfully executed more than one billion revolutions. During the commissioning phase of the instrument and during the first operation phase, random <b>torque</b> <b>spikes,</b> which manifested themselves as a motor current increase, were observed in the Scan Drive Mechanism, whereas the Scan Compensation drive operated nominally from the beginning. The result of the root cause investigations performed in order to isolate the issue, and the consequences for the follow-on MWRI equipment which was successfully launched by end of September 2013 (now flying on the FY 3 -C Spacecraft), are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aerospace {{mechanism}} engineering {{success stories}} often, if not always, consist of overcoming developmental, test and flight anomalies. Many times {{it is these}} anomalies that stimulate technology growth and more reliable future systems. However, one must learn from these to achieve an ultimately successful mission. It is not often that a spacecraft engineer is able to inspect hardware that has flown in orbit for several years. However, in February 1997, the Fine Guidance Sensor- 1 (FGS- 1) {{was removed from the}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and returned to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) during the second Servicing Mission (SM 2). At the time of removal, FGS- 1 had nearly 7 years of service and the bearings in the Star Selector Servos (SSS) had accumulated approximately 25 million Coarse Track (CT) cycles. The main reason for its replacement was due to a bearing torque anomaly leading to stalling of the B Star Selector Servo (SSS-B) when reversing direction during a vehicle offset maneuver, referred to herein as a Reversal Bump (RB). The returned HST FGS SSS bearings were disassembled for post-service condition assessment to better understand the actual cause of the <b>torque</b> <b>spikes,</b> identify potential process/design improvements, and provide information for remedial on-orbit operation modifications. The methods and technology utilized for this inspection are not unique to this system and can be adapted to most investigations at varying stages of the mechanism life from development, through testing, to post flight evaluation. The systematic methods used for the HST Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) SSS and specific findings are the subjects presented in this paper. The lessons learned include the importance of cleanliness and handling for precision instrument bearings and the potential effects from contamination. The paper describes in detail, the analytical techniques used for the SSS and their importance in this investigation. Inspection analytical data and photographs are included throughout the paper...|$|R
40|$|Well {{reported}} problems around {{air quality}} and climate change, {{together with the}} energy crisis resulting from finite fossil fuel resources is motivating all the automotive manufacturers to develop new propulsion systems through electrification and hybridisation. The range extended electric vehicle (REEV) {{is one of these}} solutions that seeks a practical compromise between the on-board battery size and the one-charge driving range. The auxiliary power unit (APU) is the key component in a REEV and is designed to maintain the battery charge for long distance trips. Since the APU does not propel the vehicle, it only requires a small capacity engine with low-cylinder-count. This type of engine exhibits severe speed fluctuations due to its low firing frequency. As the engine and the M/G are isolated from the vehicle driving wheels, it is possible to use the electric machine to deliver a counteracting torque to the engine reducing the resultant <b>torque</b> <b>spikes</b> and thus the system speed oscillation but likely to increase the electric losses. This research work aims to minimise the speed fluctuation balanced against the extra losses introduced. A Dynamic Torque Control (DTC) strategy was designed and tested on an APU using a novel approach to achieve this target. The system components were modelled individually regarding to the prototype system specifications, which is developed within a collaborative R&D project. The empirical engine model was calibrated with extensive bench testing data to recreate the in-cycle torque waveforms. The motor/generator was modelled as a novel hybrid between an analytical model and an FEA model which allowed the winding inductance variation due to the current rise {{to be included in the}} model. This approach was designed to replicate the electric machine performance with high fidelity whilst keeping the computational time and cost low. With the help from the system model, the DTC torque demand patterns were designed based on detailed analysis of the contribution factors of the speed fluctuation and the electric machine losses. A unique Pareto Curve of the speed fluctuation reduction and the electrical loss was identified during the analysis and allowed the optimal demand pattern to be developed for a given torque capability electric machine. The simulation results showed that the system in-cycle speed fluctuations could be reduced by 16. 4 % and 19. 11 % at 2000 rpm full load and 4500 rpm full load condition respectively while the electric specific fuel consumption (ESFC) rose by 2. 26 % and 1. 35 % at the same operation points. The DTC strategy was implemented in the prototype APU and successfully tested on the rig at 2000 rpm and 4500 rpm. A reduction in the speed oscillation and the ESFC increase consistent with the simulation results were observed. The simulation estimates on ESFC was proved within an error of 2. 19 %. This research improves the insight into the mechanisms that are responsible for increased losses when dynamic torque control is used and develops an optimisation approach which takes account of these factors. When an electric machine, which does not have the same instantaneous peak torque capability as the engine, is used in an APU, a better compromise between speed fluctuation smoothing and system efficiency can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Currently applied {{indicator}} organism systems, such as coliforms, {{are not fully}} protective of public health from enteric viruses in water sources. Waterborne disease outbreaks have occurred in systems that tested negative for coliforms, and positive coliform results do not necessarily correlate with viral risk. It is widely recognized that bacterial indicators do not co-occur exclusively with infectious viruses, nor do they respond {{in the same manner}} to environmental or engineered stressors. Thus, a more appropriate indicator of health risks from infectious enteric viruses is needed. Presentation of the hypothesis Torque teno virus is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that likely exhibits similar transport characteristics to pathogenic enteric viruses. Torque teno virus is unique among enteric viral pathogens in that it appears to be ubiquitous in humans, elicits seemingly innocuous infections, and does not exhibit seasonal fluctuations or epidemic <b>spikes.</b> <b>Torque</b> teno virus is transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route and can be assayed using rapid molecular techniques. We hypothesize that Torque teno virus is a more appropriate indicator of viral pathogens in drinking waters than currently used indicator systems based solely on bacteria. Testing the hypothesis To test the hypothesis, a multi-phased research approach is needed. First, a reliable Torque teno virus assay must be developed. A rapid, sensitive, and specific PCR method using established nested primer sets would be most appropriate for routine monitoring of waters. Because PCR detects both infectious and inactivated virus, an in vitro method to assess infectivity also is needed. The density and occurrence of Torque teno virus in feces, wastewater, and source waters must be established to define spatial and temporal stability of this potential indicator. Finally, Torque teno virus behavior through drinking water treatment plants must be determined with co-assessment of traditional indicators and enteric viral pathogens to assess whether correlations exist. Implications of the hypothesis If substantiated, Torque teno virus could provide a completely new, reliable, and efficient indicator system for viral pathogen risk. This indicator would have broad application to drinking water utilities, watershed managers, and protection agencies and would provide a better means to assess viral risk and protect public health. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation reviews {{many aspects}} of spaceflight. There are many pictures of the International Space Station. Some of the topics covered in this review are: Have you ever wondered why we have launch windows? Or why {{the attitude of the}} Space Station changes? The half-day seminar answers some of the many questions about why and how we fly in space. Topics in the course were: What's so valuable about micro gravity? How do we get to micro G so close to a huge gravity well like the Earth? How come such a big rocket gets so little payload to space? Why do we have daily launch windows, and why are they so short? What's the beta angle, why does it change so strangely, and why do we care so much about it? Why do we have launch seasons for the Shuttle? Why can't we just launch any old day? Why do we see the station some days, not on others, and at different times and directions? Why do we keep changing the attitude of the Space Station? What are the certified attitudes of the station, and why did we pick these few? Why do we keep changing the altitude of the Space Station among these three? What's the difference between Power Balance, Energy Balance, and Depth-of-Discharge? Where does all the uncertainty come from in our orbit predictions for phasing, collisions, communications coverage, etc? Why do we usually reboost only on days that we do attitude changes? What's F(10. 7), what does it do, why do we care, and why does it vary so much? Why do we care about orbital phasing of the ISS? Can't we just do phasing with the arriving vehicles? Why is the Space Station built the way it is? What's Sun Slicer? (or Night Glider, or Dual Angle, or (coming soon!) Mixmaster, or Outrigger, or [...] .) What's a BGA, and what is BGA conditioning all about? What's a Control Moment Gyroscope, and what does it do? What's a desat? Why is it more trouble now than it used to be? How much orbital debris is there, and how dangerous is it? Why aren't we more worried about meteor storms? What is atomic Oxygen? Where does it come from, and why is it a nuisance? What's a gravity gradient attitude, and why don't we use it? How come we see things like phantom <b>torques</b> and phantom <b>spikes</b> and other things that Shuttles and stations and capsules have never seen? and How are all these topics affecting our assembly plans for this year and through the life of station...|$|R
