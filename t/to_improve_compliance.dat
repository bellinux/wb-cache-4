2500|$|Major {{barriers}} to compliance {{are thought to}} include the complexity of modern medication regimens, poor [...] "health literacy" [...] and lack of comprehension of treatment benefits, the occurrence of undiscussed side effects and poor treatment satisfaction, the cost of prescription medicine, and poor communication or lack of trust between the patient {{and his or her}} health-care provider. [...] Efforts <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>compliance</b> have been aimed at simplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. Current studies show a great variation in terms of characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence. It is still unclear how adherence can consistently be improved in order to promote clinically important effects.|$|E
2500|$|Speed {{reduction}} {{has traditionally}} been attempted {{by the introduction of}} statutory speed limits.

[...] Zones where speeds are set at 30 km/h (or 20mph) are gaining popularity [...] as they are found to be effective at reducing crashes and increasing community cohesion. Speed limits which are set below the speed that most motorists perceive to be reasonable for the given road require additional measures <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>compliance.</b> [...] Attempts to improve speed limit observance are usually by either education, enforcement or road engineering.
