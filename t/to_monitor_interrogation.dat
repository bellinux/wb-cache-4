50|$|After the Tiananmen Square {{protests of}} 1989, Fang was {{pressured}} by the Chinese government {{to admit that}} his injuries were from a road accident. Fang refused, which resulted in Beijing Sport University’s withholding of Fang’s university degree and denying him a work assignment. Fang’s involvement in the protests also led to legal complications that prevented him from registering his household and his marriage. Also, Fang withdrew his membership from the Chinese Communist Party. From 1992 to 2000, Fang resided in Hainan Province where he continued <b>to</b> face <b>monitoring,</b> <b>interrogation,</b> and harassment in such instances as the detainment by police {{of family and friends}} visiting Fang in 1995 and the monitoring and cutting off of his phone line on anniversaries of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.|$|R

5000|$|Passive {{integrated}} transponders (PIT) {{are another}} method of telemetry used {{to track the}} movements of a species [...] Passive integrated transponders, or [...] "PIT tags", are electronic tags that allow researchers to collect data from a specimen without the need to recapture and handle the animal. Data is captured and <b>monitored</b> via electronic <b>interrogation</b> antennae, which records the time and location of the individual. [...] Pit tags are a humane method of tracking that has little risk of infection or mortality due to the limited contact necessary <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the specimens. They are also cost-efficient in {{that they can be}} used repeatedly should the need arise to remove the tag from the animal.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} LX-1O-Terran-C, {{the product of}} a genetic {{engineering}} project on one of the Cetagandan planets. He is a genetic construct designed to have telepathic abilities, and to function as an undercover agent. Unfortunately his abilities depend on him consuming large quantities of the amino-acid tyramine, and they are too variable to be useful in the field. He was employed in <b>monitoring</b> <b>interrogations</b> instead, but found the experiences so horrifying that he, along with a fellow telepath known as JN9, or Janine, escaped, using their training as agents to hide from Cetagandan agents. When she was later killed, he used his abilities to amass enough money to have House Bharaputra on Jackson's Whole splice her DNA into the shipments of ovaries destined for the planet Athos. By spreading the telepathy gene across the galaxy he hoped to avoid the Cetagandans having a monopoly on the ability. However, when he reaches Kline Station, where the shipment is waiting for transfer to Athos, he discovers the Cetagandans waiting for him. His story is told in the novel Ethan of Athos.|$|R

5000|$|Combination with static analysis. A common {{combination}} of static and dynamic analyses, particularly encountered in compilers, is <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> all the requirements which cannot be discharged statically. A dual and ultimately equivalent approach tends {{to become the}} norm in runtime verification, namely to use static analysis {{to reduce the amount}} of otherwise exhaustive monitoring. Static analysis can be performed both on the property <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> and on the system <b>to</b> be <b>monitored.</b> Static analysis of the property <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> can reveal that certain events are unnecessary <b>to</b> <b>monitor,</b> that the creation of certain monitors can be delayed, and that certain existing monitors will never trigger and thus can be garbage collected. Static analysis of the system <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> can detect code that can never influence the monitors. For example, when monitoring the HasNext property above, one needs not instrument portions of code where each call i.next (...) is immediately preceded on any path by a call i.hasnext (...) which returns true (visible on the control-flow graph).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Engine {{fuel flow}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parameters of aero-engine performance, which can accurately reflect the actual condition of aero-engine. It'is possible <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the aero-engine fuel flow (FF) by reading the data of QAR (Quick Access Recorder). However, it's difficult <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the actual condition of aero-engine through the traditional method because of the vast amount of QAR data and the complexity of the engine itself. Feed forward process neural network is adopted <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the QAR-based aero-engine fuel flow. The results of the simulation are acceptable and show that the Neural Net model is an effective method <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> aero-engine conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{monitoring}} {{application needs}} {{information such as}} log file path and number of threads to run with. Once the application is running, it needs to know what <b>to</b> <b>monitor,</b> and deduce how <b>to</b> <b>monitor.</b> Because the configuration data for what <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> is needed {{in other areas of}} the system, such as deployment, the configuration data should not be tailored specifically for use by the system monitor, but should be a generalized system configuration model.|$|R
50|$|Another method <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> may be <b>to</b> connect a layer-1 hub {{between the}} {{monitored}} device and its switch port. This will induce minor delay, but will provide multiple interfaces {{that can be}} used <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the individual switch port.|$|R

40|$|Among {{the factors}} {{providing}} incentives <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the behaviour of input suppliers are the regulatory requirements to which downstream firms are subject. We develop a formal economic model {{to examine the}} relationship between the strictness of the regulatory environment and downstream firms’ incentives to act as inspectors of their sub-contractors. We consider the interaction between a downstream producer and an upstream input supplier. The downstream chooses the probability with which <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the upstream’s compliance and the upstream chooses a compliance level which determines compliance of the end product with quality or environmental regulation. We find that the strictness of regulation affects the downstream’s monitoring strategy in combination with the level of quality or environmental standards. If the standards are sufficiently low then the strictness of regulation increases incentives <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the upstream. Contrary, if the standards are sufficiently high then the pressure on the downstream <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the upstream is relaxed and the strictness of regulation decreases incentives <b>to</b> <b>monitor.</b> We argue that the strictness of regulation should not be treated in isolation as a factor determining the choice of downstream firms <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> their input suppliers. compliance; monitoring; supply chain; quality and environmental regulation...|$|R
