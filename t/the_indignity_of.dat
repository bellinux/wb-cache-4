He started the Czech Republic's second group game against Portugal, but Portugal won 3–1 and Baroš failed to score. Jan Koller was preferred to Baroš {{in the starting lineup}} for the next match, against Turkey.

Although Charles and Parliament granted amnesty to nearly all of Cromwell's {{supporters}} in the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion, 50 people were specifically excluded. In the end nine of the regicides were executed: they were hanged, drawn and quartered; others were given life imprisonment or simply excluded from office for life.

25|$|For agent Mills the {{attention}} was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known. On the band's tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided {{some of the}} traveling difficulties of African-Americans by touring in private railcars.

It is true, is it not, that every man {{is something of a}} cripple and something of a beast? I've dipped a little deeper than most; that's all. It's only now when he has fully learnt the truth of that, that he can take hold of himself to be neither beast nor cripple. Now that he overcomes his servitude to his body, he can for the first time think of living the full life of his body.... Before another generation dies you'll have the thing in hand.

This situation continued until Jack Dunnett, a local member of parliament, took control of the club. He appointed Jimmy Sirrel, a charismatic Scot who had once played for Celtic F.C., as manager in November 1969. In the 1970–71 season, The Magpies clinched the Fourth Division title in record-breaking style, remaining unbeaten at Meadow Lane.|$|E
25|$|P. Munch's {{last years}} were not happy ones. As the {{occupation}} wore on, and {{especially after the}} liberation in 1945 his record as foreign minister came under severe attack from many sides. In late 1945 he had to subject to <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> <b>of</b> prolonged interrogation by a Parliamentary Committee set up to investigate {{the circumstances surrounding the}} occupation. Up until his death in 1948 there were repeated suggestions that he should be put on trial for negligence (and even treason).

The song soon made the rounds of camp and became popular with other soldiers, partly because hatred of reveille was universal.|$|R
25|$|By July 1969 a three-door wagon version {{intended}} for private use arrived, the LS11 Suzuki Fronte Estate, to give passenger car buyers a model with more luggage room without <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> <b>of</b> having {{to buy a}} commercial vehicle. The Estate had the same top-hinged rear opening, but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|E

To these brave priests and many others who suffered we owe a great tribute of thankfulness and praise, for it was through their determination to stand by the Church in her hour of peril that we have won the tolerance and liberty we have today. The Act of Parliament under which these priests suffered {{is still on the}} Statute Book, but for all practical purposes it is dead.|$|E
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> <b>of</b> their situations was {{directly related to}} easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E

25|$|Distributions to {{qualified}} {{persons were}} monthly. However, a certain {{proportion of the}} population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> <b>of</b> receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.|$|E
25|$|It was as {{an opening}} batsman that Sanders was {{most often used}} by Queensland. He made his {{first-class}} cricket debut in the 1950/51 Shield season and {{was never able to}} become a regular fixture in the side, instead he was used more as a reserve batsman for Queensland, who filled a spot when a player was injured. His best effort with the bat came in the 1951/52 season, against Victoria, when he opened the batting and made 49. He missed out on his half century when he edged a ball from John Cordner to the keeper. After an absence of two years, Sanders played his 10th and final first-class match when he was called up as a middle order batsman for a Shield fixture against New South Wales. He suffered <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> <b>of</b> scoring a pair and his dismissal in the second innings put debutant spinner Jack Treanor on a hat-trick, which he completed with the wicket of Peter Burge.|$|E

Ripple Rock, an undersea double pinnacle that sank more than 100 vessels (and cost as many lives) over the years, was obliterated by a man-made explosion on April 5, 1958.|$|R

500|$|The {{repetitive}} visual {{design of}} Cybertron drew criticism from critics. Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{majority of the}} game entails walking through similar-looking corridors." [...] Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann also cited repetitive visuals, but conceded that [...] "the metallic world of Cybertron doesn't lend itself particularly well {{to a lot of}} environmental variety." [...] 1UP.com's Matt Miller also raised issue with the repetitive visuals, but provided a counterpoint in saying [...] "there are a host of features in place to save the game from spiraling into mediocrity." [...] John Hamblin of Eurogamer and Tom McShea of GameSpot also pointed out the game's vast lack of ammunition. [...] "Watching Lord Megatron repeatedly suffering <b>the</b> <b>indignity</b> <b>of</b> being shot at by drones while he desperately scours the debris looking for an elusive ammo box [...] is just sad" [...] stated Hamblin. [...] He was further critical of the game's checkpoint system, which often leaves players in difficult situations upon respawning.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Napoleon's Continental System (beginning 1806) and the British Orders in Council (1807) {{established}} embargoes {{that made}} international trade precarious. From 1807 to 1812, about 900 American ships were seized as a result. The U.S. responded with the Embargo Act of 1807, which prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign ports and closed American ports to British ships. Jefferson's embargo was especially unpopular in New England, where merchants preferred <b>the</b> <b>indignities</b> <b>of</b> impressment to <b>the</b> halting of overseas commerce.
