Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Obesity is most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Emilia {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that crossed northern Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 16. The system moved westward, developing a well-defined low pressure area about 525miles (850km) southwest of Acapulco by July 19. The next day, its forward motion had shifted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> north-northwest track, and with its convection continuing to organize around the low, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Early on July 21, its thunderstorm activity organized enough for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Six-E, located to the southwest of Acapulco.|$|E

From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on}} a short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph of the hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E

By the 48th lap, Reutimann, who started thirteenth, {{had moved into}} the third position. Green flag pit stops for tires, fuel and car {{adjustments}} began on lap 52, when Elliott Sadler became the first driver to pit. Stewart became the new leader after Kurt Busch came onto pit road. Stewart made his pit stop on lap 56, handing the lead to Michael Waltrip. After the leaders made their pit stops, Kyle Busch claimed the lead on lap 58. Six laps later, Kyle Busch had a 2.5 second lead over Kurt Busch. On lap 70, Jeff Gordon fell to eleventh position due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> pit stop. Two laps later, Marcos Ambrose, who started thirty-fifth, had moved up twenty-nine positions to sixth.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault.

5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures {{had done something}} similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow,</b> scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E
5|$|On September29, {{shortly after}} Keith formed, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Yucatán peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and {{a tropical storm}} warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm turned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Australian season, Poulton was {{selected}} for the ODI team the ICC Women's Quadrangular Series in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in the round-robin phase. Poulton scored only 8 and 0 from 21 and 8 balls respectively as Australia lost their first two matches against New Zealand and India respectively. She was then dropped for the next two games. She was recalled for the penultimate round-robin match against England but did not bat in a six-wicket win, and then made 27 as Australia defeated India by four wickets in the last match. The Australians needed 231 for victory—4.62 runs per over—and Poulton got their innings off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start, taking 75 balls to accumulate her runs, scoring at {{less than half of the}} required rate. However, her teammates sped up and reached the target from the last ball of the match to qualify for the final against New Zealand. Australia won by six wickets with the dropped Poulton watching from the sidelines. She ended the series with 35 runs at 11.66 with a strike rate of only 33.65, was then overlooked for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand held in Darwin in July.|$|E

5|$|As Dallas {{celebrated their}} title, the NBA {{was in a}} lockout. It ended on December 8, 2011. The {{defending}} champions lost core players, such as DeShawn Stevenson, J. J. Barea, Peja Stojaković, and Tyson Chandler, while adding veteran all-star Vince Carter, Lamar Odom, and Delonte West in free agency. The Mavericks played only two preseason games, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start for Nowitzki. Soon, Nowitzki became the 98th player in NBA history to play in 1,000 games. Nowitzki received his championship ring on January 25, 2012. After scoring his 23,335th point, Nowitzki passed Robert Parish on the all-time scoring list at #20. He then passed Charles Barkley for 19th, and scored his 24,000th point on April 15, 2012 against the Lakers. Nowitzki blocked a shot by the Celtics' Avery Bradley, which was his 1,000th block. He became one of only 3 players in NBA history with at least 1,000 3-pointers and blocks, joining Clifford Robinson and Rasheed Wallace. Nowitzki made his 11th straight All-Star game appearance in Orlando. Nowitzki scored 31 {{points in the second}} half against Houston on April 18, 2012, including 21 in the fourth quarter. It marked the third-highest scoring half by a Dallas player in franchise history. The 21 points in the fourth quarter also represented Nowitzki's third-highest scoring quarter of his career. Carrying the load of the Mavericks, Nowitzki led his team in scoring 45 times. On March 30, he led the Mavs down from 15 points, including a game winner, against the Magic. Nowitzki's streak of 11 seasons with 1,500 points came to an end after scoring 1,342 in the shortened NBA season. The Mavs clinched the seventh spot in the West, and were matched against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2012 NBA Playoffs. The Thunder swept the Mavs in 4 games.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got around}} the outside of Hamilton in turn one, while Räikkönen lost {{positions}} due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> getaway. Sebastian Vettel got past Verstappen, but was immediately repassed on the approach to turn four. At {{the front of the}} race, coming out of turn three, Hamilton tried to retake the position from Rosberg. As the latter defended his position, Hamilton went off the track and spun and they collided at turn 4, ending the race of both Mercedes drivers. The collision resulted in a safety car period, with the order standing: Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Vettel and Räikkönen. The safety car came in at the end of lap four. Vettel got past Sainz on lap eight and Räikkönen tried to follow suit two laps later, but was forced off track into turn two. He completed the move one lap later at the same spot. Sainz and Button were the first to come into the pit lane for new tyres on lap 12, followed by race leader Ricciardo one lap later, making Verstappen the first Dutchman to lead a Grand Prix, before he came in another lap later. When Vettel made a pit stop on lap 16, he emerged third behind the two Red Bull drivers, all on the medium compound tyre.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and fourth}} sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. Conditions were dry for the Friday morning and afternoon {{practice sessions}}. Coulthard set the first session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 53.398 seconds, eight-tenths of a second quicker than Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen had the third-fastest time, with Jarno Trulli, Barrichello and Jacques Villeneuve in the next three positions. The two Benetton drivers were seventh and eighth (with Wurz ahead of Fisichella), and the Williams cars of Ralf Schumacher and Button completed the top ten. Alesi's Prost had a fuel-pressure problem which prevented him from completing a timed lap, and he was the slowest overall. In the second practice session, due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> rear puncture Coulthard's first-session lap was still the fastest; Häkkinen had the second-fastest time. Jaguar driver Johnny Herbert changed his car's balance, improving its performance and finishing third-fastest. Villeneuve moved into fourth after changes to his car's setup; Michael Schumacher slipped to fifth, and Wurz finished sixth. Jos Verstappen was seventh-fastest, ahead of Fisichella, Barrichello and Trulli.|$|E
