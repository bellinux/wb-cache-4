500|$|The duo were {{disappointed}} with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, {{who felt that}} he sang poorly.

2500|$|On the November 26, 2005 {{episode of}} Impact!, Gayda made her debut lashing out at Jeff Jarrett.

[...] After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, {{the same thing happened}} in the main event match, but Gayda was restrained by officials. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there {{had nothing to do with}} a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, she <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> to see Kim in her place. She said she had a big secret about Jarrett that TNA Management would love to hear, but did not reveal what it was.|$|E

50|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001 Wong had <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> to watch the news when he learned of the {{terrorist}} attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.. He and his wife Rose spent all day watching the news and trying to discern the fate of Wong's sons, who lived in New York and, as they ultimately learned, were unharmed. Rose finally went to bed in the evening, but Wong stayed up and continued to follow the news. The resulting exhaustion and the two strokes he had suffered years earlier took their toll, and Wong {{died of a heart attack}} at some point during {{the morning of}} September 12.

50|$|In mild {{cases of}} autophobia, {{treatment}} {{can sometimes be}} very simple.

Using noise to interrupt the silence of isolated situations can often be a great help for people suffering from autophobia.|$|R

Mrs. Turner gets a call from Vicky, who says that Timmy not only immediately <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> after they left, but also caused {{a variety of other}} destructive events around the house such as breaking the vase, shredding the family pictures, burning the piano, and writing [...] "My Parents Stink" [...] and [...] "Dinkleberg Rulz" [...] on the living room walls that were really caused by Vicky herself. Mr. and Mrs. Turner became so angry they erupt in a nuclear explosion, blowing the top off Dinkleberg's house off as they shouted Timmy's name. Vicky is satisfied with her dirty work as she says that Timmy will be in so much trouble, and runs off to get her camera so she can record Mr. and Mrs. Turner.|$|E
40|$|The thesis "Who saves or {{does not}} save the energy: Uncovering the reasons for {{practicing}} energy-saving activities in households" identifies the segments which tend to (not) perform selected household energy saving activities and discover the reasons behind the (non) practicing these activities. The author uses both quantitative and qualitative approach. By quantitative approach, the author analyzes data from pilot project PURGE {{in order to identify}} segments which are more likely to do selected activities. Emphasis is placed on class position. The author's own qualitative survey by semi-structured interviews identifies the reasons behind this activities. Generally, the author discovered that the upper classes practice energy- saving activities more often than the lower classes which is consistent with findings that lower classes tend to perform habitual behavior and rely on technology and upper classes tend to calculate and study the effect of these activities. Among lowest educational category are (compared with other educational groups) more people who leave always or often <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> or radio, even when no one is watching.

Now I <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> and see Americans without jobs, without food and without a chance to help themselves.

50|$|Among {{the voice}} actors {{for the game}} are former Monty Python members Terry Jones as the Parrot, and John Cleese (under the {{pseudonym}} of Kim Bread, itself an in-joke as this was the nickname John Cleese wished to be credited as when appearing in a Doctor Who serial written by Douglas Adams) as the Bomb. Adams {{is the voice of}} the Succ-U-Bus, and plays the part of the ship's creator, Leovinus, in one of the closing scenes.

5000|$|The song {{talks about}} three {{particular}} {{instances in which}} the narrator realizes [...] "there ain't no rest for the wicked." [...] First, he encounters a prostitute asking if he desires {{to spend the night}} with her. The narrator proceeds to ask her why she does what she does. The chorus (her response) analyzes the main reasons why individuals follow the paths they follow ("...Money don't grow on trees, I've got bills to pay, I've got mouths to feed..."). The narrator, fifteen minutes later, is mugged by a criminal, whom he asks the same question and from whom he receives the same answer. Finally, upon <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> <b>the</b> narrator sees a preacher being arrested for stealing the funds of his church. This is followed by a third chorus saying that everyone is the same and we all have no rest [...] "until we close our eyes for good." ...|$|R

This gets him sent to his room, where he basically goes about converting himself into a hot rod convertible. He comes out and zooms around the room, stopping in front of John, who, in disgust, checks out everything on him, then spanks him (by opening his trunk, exposing his bare buttocks) and sends him back to his room, demanding he go back to his taxi persona.|$|R
500|$|The comic, {{published}} monthly in Highlights for Children, {{consists of}} two panels depicting the actions of two children, Goofus and Gallant. Gallant's actions are always virtuous and respectful, in contrast to Goofus's, which are always rude and selfish. They are presented {{side by side with}} a brief caption (e.g. [...] "Goofus <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> when there are guests; whenever guests arrive, Gallant turns off <b>the</b> <b>television</b> at once.") though the direct results of their actions, good or bad, are never depicted. The strip's protagonists have varied in age and appearance over time, variously shown with long or short, or dark or light hair and aged twelve or eight or five years old. Goofus and Gallant have never appeared in the same panel of the comic.|$|R
50|$|Bab's {{first day}} sees him {{indirectly}} {{looking at the}} coconut vendor via a reflection in a heavily tinted window. However, an Ilocano-speaking security guard accosts him and they begin an informal conversation about the rigours of the job. It is revealed that the window Bab looked at {{was that of a}} bank. Unknown to both of them, a robbery was already in progress. Disappointed with the outcome of the initial surveillance, Bab goes home, changes clothes, and <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> just as a news program comes on air. He does not pay attention, as the show reports a robbery at the same bank where he chatted with the security guard. Worse, the guard himself has been arrested as a suspected accomplice.|$|R

One {{has only to}} <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> these days and see the awful grist that is offered {{to the public in}} the guise of badly written {{situation}} comedies and dramas, not to mention the proliferation of supposed news shows consisting of people shouting at each other in stage-managed entertainment on sets with pictures of the U. S. Capitol in the background. Surprisingly, one sees few historical dramas on television, unlike, for example, in England, where the British Broadcasting Corporation routinely draws on some episode in the country’s history to provide well-done and generally interesting popular entertainment...|$|R

50|$|Especially in {{societies}} like the United States, where linguistics or ethnic diversity {{are not particularly}} valued, language-minority children encounter powerful forces for language shift or assimilation when they enter the majority-speaking world of the classroom in the society’s schools. Young children are extremely vulnerable to the social pressures exerted by people in their social worlds. But the social pressure they experience are not entirely external. Internal pressure too play a part. Once they <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> and they can {{see that they are}} different in language, in appearance and in behavior and they come to regard these differences as undesirable. At the same time, they are motivated to stop using their L1, all too often long before they have mastered the second language, all due to the internal and external pressures from their environment.|$|R
