5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> mesosphere, and thermosphere.

Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere</b> is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth.

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{model of}} Ko et al. (1985) {{was used to}} calculate the stratospheric concentrations of ozone, to determine the principal modes of balance for different stratospheric regions. The results of this analysis show that the local concentration of ozone in different regions of stratosphere is determined by balances between different mechanisms. In <b>the</b> upper <b>stratosphere,</b> <b>the</b> ozone concentration is dominated by photochemical processes, whereas in <b>the</b> mid-lower <b>stratosphere,</b> <b>the</b> bulk of ozone appears to be controlled by an interaction between the transport and the photochemical processes.

5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere.</b>|$|E
40|$|A first-order, {{analytic}} {{estimate of}} the dynamical change in column ozone density is given {{as a function of}} temperature change in <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere.</b> It is found that, for each 1 percent (about 2 C) cooling averaged over <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere,</b> <b>the</b> column ozone density can be expected to decrease by approximately 7 percent, if it can be assumed that such a temperature change is induced by changes in wave transports...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on the winter middle atmosphere is modeled with a mechanistic global primitive equation model. The model's polar vortex evolution is sensitive to <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere's</b> tropical winds, with the polar vortex becoming more (less) disturbed as the lower stratospheric winds are more easterly (westerly). This agrees with the observed relationship between wintertime polar circulation strength and the phase of the QBO in <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere.</b> In these experiments it is the extratropical planetary Rossby waves that provide the tropical-extratropical coupling mechanism. More easterly tropical winds in <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> act to confine the extratropical Rossby waves farther north {{and closer to the}} vortex at the QBO altitudes, weakening the vortex relative to the case of westerly QBO phase. While the QBO winds occur in <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere,</b> <b>the</b> anomaly in the polar vortex strength is strongest at higher levels...|$|R

A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, {{most of which are}} consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere,</b> which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientific}} {{studies suggest that}} ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling {{has the effect of}} intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic gas {{includes}} {{a variety of}} substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano. Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere</b> can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth's ozone layer. Because carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air, the gas may flow into low-lying areas and collect in the soil. The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in these areas can be lethal to people, animals, and vegetation.|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between ozone and temperature in <b>the</b> upper <b>stratosphere</b> {{is used to}} estimate the drift in the SBUV spectrometer on Nimbus- 7 and the linear trend in ozone from 1979 to 1986.

These relations are {{used to determine the}} ozone sensitivity to temperature and ozone trends in terms of temperature trends. It is shown that in <b>the</b> upper <b>stratosphere</b> (approximately 2 mbar), the eight-year trend in ozone is a manifestation of dynamical perturbations.

40|$|The space-time {{variations}} in water vapor {{in the upper}} troposphere and lower <b>stratosphere</b> (UTLS) over <b>the</b> Asian summer monsoon (ASM) regions are investigated using six years of observations from the Aura-MLS to understand the ASM role in transporting water vapor to <b>the</b> tropical <b>stratosphere.</b> While some previous studies indicated that the ASM {{plays a role in}} dehydrating <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere,</b> <b>the</b> present investigations revealed that the ASM region plays an active role in hydrating rather than dehydrating <b>the</b> tropical lower <b>stratosphere.</b> <b>The</b> analysis also shows that only during the month of August (ASM) is moist air pumped into <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> over <b>the</b> two key geographical locations (India and Western Pacific). The air parcel from the tropical tropopause takes approximately 10 - 12 months to reach the mid-stratosphere with an ascent rate of 2. 8 × 10 - 4 m s- 1. Thus it is envisaged that the present results will have important implications in understanding the exchange processes across the tropopause and its role in stratosphere chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Major Stratospheric Sudden Warmings (SSWs) are {{characterized}} by {{a reversal of the}} zonal mean zonal wind and an anomalous warming in <b>the</b> polar <b>stratosphere</b> that proceeds downward to <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere.</b> In <b>the</b> tropical <b>stratosphere,</b> a downward propagating cooling is observed. However, the strong modulation of tropical winds and temperatures by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) renders accurate characterization of the tropical response to SSWs challenging. A novel metric based on temperature variations relative to the central date of the SSW using ERA-Interim data is presented. It filters most of the temperature structure related to the phase of the QBO and provides proper characterization of the SSW cooling amplitude and downward propagation tropical signal. Using this new metric, a large SSW-related cooling is detected in <b>the</b> tropical upper <b>stratosphere</b> that occurs almost simultaneously with the polar cap warming. The tropical cooling weakens as it propagates downward, reaching <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> in a few days. Substantial differences are found in the response to SSWs depending on the QBO phase. Similar to what is observed in <b>the</b> polar <b>stratosphere,</b> tropical SSW-associated temperatures persist longer during the west QBO phase at levels above about 40 hPa, suggesting that the signal is mainly controlled by changes in the residual mean meridional circulation associated with SSWs. Conversely, in <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere,</b> around 50 - 70 hPa, enhanced cooling occurs only during QBO east phase. This behavior seems to be driven by anomalous subtropical wave breaking related to changes in the zero-wind line position with the QBO phase.

5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather prediction is to sample {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage, however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E
