5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> about an hour after sunset. This may be in order to mate, {{or they may be}} influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Many {{secondary}} sponsors {{have invested}} in the tournament as well. Nike supplies the official match ball, as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> all other CONMEBOL competitions. Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer is also a secondary sponsor as the official Copa Libertadores video game. This was the first video game to feature the competition.

5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, {{the realm of the}} dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to the deceased as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E

25|$|Specialised {{arbitration}} {{organizations have}} been formed in order to settle disputes {{in the matter of}} specialised issues, they work in only a very limited field but are highly specialised in the work <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>For</b> this purpose they have made a special rules, procedures and regulations which they follow during the proceedings of arbitration. These institutions prove very useful in the cases where a very deep and specialised knowledge is needed in settlement, which in turn can be cost effective and time saving.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods for}} {{inferring}} evolutionary relationships use parsimony {{in a more}} traditional way. Likelihood methods for phylogeny use parsimony as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ information theory, a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.|$|E
25|$|This {{contains}} the lessons, psalms and liturgical formularies for saints' festivals, and {{depends on the}} days of the secular month. The readings of the second Nocturn are mainly hagiological biography, with homilies or papal documents for certain major feasts, particularly those of Jesus and Mary. Some of this material has been revised by Leo XIII, in view of archaeological and other discoveries. The third Nocturn consists of a homily on the Gospel which is read at that day's Mass. Covering a great stretch of time and space, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> the worshipper in the field of church history what the Scripture readings do in that of biblical history.|$|E

25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> <b>For</b> example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for {{electrical engineers}} are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, {{and the ability to}} understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{regarding}} statistical cues to phonological acquisition is {{a phenomenon}} known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to {{the same category as}} the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme. If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.|$|E
