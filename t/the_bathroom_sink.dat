Believing that he is suffering Mom's genetic experiments, Leela frees the giant, who chases the escapees until they flee down the drain of <b>the</b> giant's <b>bathroom</b> <b>sink.</b> <b>The</b> drain carries the three back to the bridge of the facility, where Leela confronts Mom.

30|$|These include {{systems that}} divert gray water for outdoor {{landscape}} irrigation, for toilet flushing and systems that divert gray water to treatment wetlands. This {{is perhaps the}} simplest form of gray water reuse, mostly from <b>the</b> laundry or <b>bathroom</b> <b>sinks</b> to a subsurface garden irrigation system or toilet flushing. Spraying gray water for irrigation is not recommended as it may {{come in contact with}} humans. These techniques are mostly gravity based without the use of any electricity. This involves very low capital and maintenance, and there is no storage involved which increases the risk of microbial growth. However, these systems does not kill or reduce the disease causing pathogens that may be present thereby limiting the option for reuse.|$|R

50|$|Since July 2011, the McFaddens {{have shared}} {{information}} {{to advance the}} investigation. In 2012, nearly {{a year after the}} murder, Galen McFadden gave a sample of his DNA.

Forensic testing in 2012 reveal that blood matching the DNA profile of Galen McFadden was found on the curtains of Richard's office, in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>sink,</b> and on a paper towel in the bathroom garbage can. One year after Galen's blood was found at the crime scene, officers covertly obtained Robert McFadden's DNA from a straw at a restaurant. The police forensics unit concluded the three areas where Galen's was blood found were unrelated to Richard's murder. No results concerning Robert's DNA were released.|$|E

She suggests he should act {{as if he is}} fine, and do something to let the subordinates know he remains a decisive leader. At Satriale's, Tony tries to bait Perry into a confrontation under the pretext that he slammed the refrigerator doors but he does not respond. With his crew looking on, Tony punches his bodyguard, starting a one-sided fight that ends with Perry bleeding on the floor and Tony defiantly walking away, seemingly unscathed. Afterwards, Tony retreats to the bathroom and vomits blood. Leaning on <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>sink</b> and looking at himself in the mirror, Tony gives himself a twisted, satisfied smile. The moment is short-lived, however, as Tony violently vomits again in the toilet.|$|E
50|$|Space in {{communal}} apartments {{was divided}} into common spaces and private rooms “mathematically or bureaucratically,” with little to no attention paid to the physical space of the existing structures. Most apartments were partitioned in a dysfunctional manner, creating “strange spaces, long corridors, and so-called black entrances through labyrinthine inner courtyards.” Entire families lived in a single overcrowded room, with little hope of changing their situation. Residents were meant to share <b>the</b> kitchen, <b>bathroom</b> and corridors amongst themselves, but even these spaces could be divided. For example, each family might have their own kitchen table, gas burner, doorbell, and even light switch, preferring {{to walk down the}} hall to use their light switch to turn on <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> lights rather than using a closer switch belonging to another resident. Furthermore, the hallways were often poorly lit, because each family had control of one of the lights hanging in the corridor, and would only turn it on for their own benefit. Though communal apartments were relatively small, residents had to wait at times to use <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> or kitchen <b>sink.</b> <b>The</b> kitchen was the primary place the residents interacted with one another, “sharing their joys and sorrows,” and scheduling shared responsibilities. Wary of theft, residents rarely left groceries in the kitchen unless they put locks on the kitchen cabinets. However, they often stored their toiletries in the kitchen as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> because other residents could more easily use things left unattended in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Laundry was left to dry in both the kitchen and <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b>|$|R

She hadn't shown up for work. He then contacted my husband and I, and we rushed home to find the street covered with York Region Police cars, and the house filled with police officers — all looking for Alicia. In Alicia's room were her cell phone, her purse, her cigarettes, her keys. Her bed had not been slept in. Her laundry lay folded, ready to be put away. Her ring was by <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>sink</b> — she'd washed for bed. Her car was in the driveway — she'd never gone to work. The backyard was strewn with Alicia's shoes, a glass, a cigarette, and the back yard gate had been left open. A sickness fell over us.|$|E
5000|$|Episode 1 - Days 1-3 (September 14) - Geoff {{introduces}} {{the team to}} their worksite and their budgetary constraints, and Ron reveals the {{plan to build a}} [...] "high tech loft" [...] out of the space. After the whole team (except Geoff) visit Turtle Island Recycling in Toronto's Port Lands to find recycled wood for their framing needs, Geoff is noticeably unimpressed; very few 2x4 wood was found, and the rest had to be milled into 2x4s. A round of slim pickings by Gordie and Michelle on the second day leads Geoff to commission the junk hotline, which yields immediate results: a tip from a home which had recently torn out their bathroom has given the team <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>sink</b> and tub they need, though Michelle is critical of the [...] "baby bathing station" [...] and the hand shower. In the end, thanks to Cam and Ross, the framing is complete, and none of the money is spent.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{just the}} {{beginning}} of Slobodan's extreme behavioural turnaround as the blow to his head seems to have caused a major change inside it. He stops coming home in favour of hanging out and crashing at other people's dorm rooms at Studentski Grad student residence, all of which alarms his parents and Maša who report him missing to the police. Following a fight at the dorm he's reduced to spending the night in a sleeping bag on benches at the train station. The police picks him up there, mistaking him for a petty criminal, and the inspector at the station calls his mother who comes to take him home. Once there, more antagonism awaits as his already agitated father completely loses it and gets physical upon seeing aloof Slobodan relieve himself in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>sink</b> with a devil-may-care attitude. Slobodan slaps him back with a stern and sarcastic: [...] "Don't you ever do that again, daddy". The father throws {{him out of the house}} and on the way out Slobodan takes his own Volkswagen and drives off.|$|E
