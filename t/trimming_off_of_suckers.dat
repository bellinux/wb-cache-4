Typically only one die is needed to completely form the part. Extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides, forming flash.

40|$|Time-lapse imaging {{is often}} {{the only way to}} {{appreciate}} fully the many dynamic cell movements critical to neural development. Zebrafish possess many advantages that make them the best vertebrate model organism for live imaging of dynamic development events. This review will discuss technical considerations of time-lapse imaging experiments in zebrafish, describe selected examples of imaging studies in zebrafish that revealed new features or principles of neural development, and consider the promise and challenges of future time-lapse studies of neural development in zebrafish embryos and adults.

50|$|Few {{essential}} {{tools are}} needed in carpet weaving: Knives are used to cut the yarn after the knot is made, a heavy instrument like a comb for beating in the wefts, and a pair <b>of</b> scissors for <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> the ends <b>of</b> the yarn after each row of knots is finished. From region to region, they vary in size and design, and in some areas are supplemented by other tools. The weavers of Tabriz used a combined blade and hook. The hook projects {{from the end of}} the blade, and is used for knotting, instead of knotting with the fingers. Comb-beaters are passed through the warp strings to beat in the wefts.

40|$|Clustering {{procedures}} {{allowing for}} general covariance {{structures of the}} obtained clusters need some constraints on the solutions. With this in mind, several proposals have been introduced in the literature. The TCLUST procedure works with a restriction on the "eigenvalues-ratio" of the clusters scatter matrices. In {{order to try to}} achieve robustness with respect to outliers, the procedure allows to <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> a proportion <b>of</b> the most outlying observations. The resistance to infinitesimal contamination of the TCLUST has already been studied. This paper aims to look at its resistance to a higher amount of contamination by means of the study of its breakdown behavior. The rather new concept of restricted breakdown point will demonstrate that the TCLUST procedure resists to a proportion of contamination equal to the trimming rate as soon as the data set is sufficiently "well clustered".

40|$|Abstract—Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) {{data are}} {{a rapidly growing}} example of big data {{and a source of}} new knowl-edge in science. However, sequencing errors remain unavoidable and reduce the quality of NGS data. Error correction, therefore, is a critical step in the successful utilization of NGS data, including de novo genome assembly and DNA resequencing. Since NGS throughput doubles approximately every five months and the length of NGS records (i. e., reads) is increasing, improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of computational strategies are needed. In this study, we aim to improve the performance of CloudRS, an open-source MapReduce application designed to correct sequencing errors in NGS data. We introduce the read-message (RM) diagram to represent the set of messages, i. e., the key-value pairs generated on each read. We also present the Gradient-number Votes (GNV) scheme in order to <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> portions <b>of</b> the RM diagram, thereby reducing the total size of messages associated with each read. Experimental results show that the GNV scheme successfully reduce execution time and improve the quality of the de novo genome assembly.

40|$|Herbage {{production}} of continuously grazed hill country pastures {{has traditionally been}} measured using grazing exclusion cages and a trim technique. Herbage production values obtained via this system {{differ from those of}} the surrounding grazed sward due to differences in sward structure. Herbage {{production of}} four farmlets with differing fertiliser treatments was measured by two methods over a full year. The first method involved a computer model which calculated herbage production from dry matter intake and cover change. Secondly, herbage production was measured via frame cuts, and the results of the two methods compared. The model measured less herbage production than the frames on an annual basis in all four fertiliser treatments (0. 77 of frame average for the four fertiliser treatments). The ratio of model to frame herbage production varied widely during the year, with maximum ratios of model to frame herbage production of 1. 6 occurring in autumn, and the minimum of - 0. 02 in winter. More herbage was produced under the frames in spring than in the grazed sward as a result of increased expression of reproductive tillers under the frames than in the grazed sward. Frames appear to underestimate herbage production in dry conditions as the <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> herbage at the placement of frames leads to lower levels of plant available water when compared to the surrounding sward. The low ratios are a result of the large amounts of dead material which build up in grazed hill pastures over summer and the rapid breakdown of this material when conditions are right, in this case in early-late winter. The results suggest that there are large differences in the annual, and seasonal pattern of herbage production between that measured off grazed swards and that measured via frames. This suggests that anyone wishing to calculate expected pasture supply using frame cut information must modify frame cut values to determine production of a continuously grazed sward...|$|R

40|$|Biomechanical {{properties}} <b>of</b> squid <b>suckers</b> {{were studied}} to provide {{inspiration for the}} development <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> artefacts for a robotic octopus. Mechanical support of the rings found inside squid suckers was studied by bending tests. Tensile tests were carried out to study the maximum possible sucking force produced by squid suckers based on the strength <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> stalks, normalized by the sucking areas. The squid suckers were also directly tested to obtain sucking forces by a special testing arrangement. Inspired by the squid <b>suckers,</b> three types <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> artefacts were developed for the arm skin of an octopus inspired robot. The first <b>sucker</b> artefact made <b>of</b> knitted nylon sheet reinforced silicone rubber has the same shape as the squid suckers. Like real squid <b>suckers,</b> this type <b>of</b> artefact also has a stalk that {{is connected to the}} arm skin and a ring to give radial support. The second design is a straight cylindrical structure with uniform wall thickness made of silicone rubber. One end of the cylinder is directly connected to the arm skin and the other end is open. The final design <b>of</b> the <b>sucker</b> has a cylindrical base and a concave meniscus top. The meniscus was formed naturally using the surface tension of silicone gel, which leads to a higher level of the liquid around the edge of a container. The wall thickness decreases towards the tip <b>of</b> the <b>sucker</b> opening. Sucking forces of all three types <b>of</b> <b>sucker</b> artefacts were measured.
