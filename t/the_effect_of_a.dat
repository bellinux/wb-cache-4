5|$|By 1909 Keynes had {{published}} his first professional economics {{article in the}} Economics Journal, about <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recent global economic downturn on India. He founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. Also in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall. Keynes's earnings rose further {{as he began to}} take on pupils for private tuition.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, German {{physician}} and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published what {{is referred to}} as Virchow's triad, the three major causes of thrombosis. The triad provides the theoretical framework for the current explanation of venous thrombosis, although it was focused on <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign body in the venous system and the conditions required for clot propagation.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept is}} that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and lighting system, with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio and lighting system animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station. The lighting pattern used for the park entrance track section gives <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E

5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in {{animals that are}} aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This had <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered {{in the end of}} serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Maeda {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by the situation of a real-life French journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby, who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and was created by Maeda {{in the hopes that}} he would go on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert Mat Beck created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.|$|E

5|$|On April 5, 2001, a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The {{increase in the}} forecast was attributed to the warm sea surface temperatures, although the agency noted that the season would likely not be as active as previous ones due to <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weak to moderate El Nino. The estimated potential {{for at least one}} major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly to 65 percent; the East Coast potential also went up slightly, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained nearly the same.|$|E
5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mutated gene on {{three generations of}} a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life. According to scholars, the novel's main themes are nature versus nurture, rebirth, and the differing {{experiences}} of what society constructs as polar opposites—such as those found between men and women. It discusses {{the pursuit of the}} American Dream and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} would {{probably}} be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to an explosion in a ship to measure <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E

In order to render words correctly, letters had to be re-written backwards so that they yielded the correct spelling. Monica Reyes' Georgetown apartment address is 67 Bennett Avenue. This is a reference to Rod Serling's address in Binghamton, New York. Furthermore, her apartment number 6, is a reference to Patrick McGoohan's number in the 1967 television series, The Prisoner.|$|E
5|$|With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve, Chauvel {{sent the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{to move on}} Magdhaba by the north and {{north-east}} {{to cut off the}} possibility of retreat while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight to Magdhaba. The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced mounted to the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed. By midday all three brigades and the Camel Brigade, despite support from machine-guns and artillery, were hotly engaged. Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft, which scouted out the Turkish positions, greatly assisted the attack, although the Turkish positions were obscured by <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mirage and dust clouds.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{alleged that}} the EIS focused almost {{exclusively}} on the Pleasant Avenue alignment, and {{that it did not}} consider <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> direct connection on speed limit compliance; faster traffic would mean more noise. Judge Paul Magnuson ruled in February 1984 that the EIS was valid, stating that the Pleasant Avenue alternative was the only reasonable one that would meet goals. This court order has been interpreted as a legal contract, prohibiting the state from raising the speed limit or allowing trucks. Construction went forward, and I-35E was opened from MN5 north to Saint Clair Avenue in 1984, using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction. Further extensions, including all new bridges, were opened to Grand Avenue in 1986, to Kellogg Boulevard in November 1988, and to I-94 on October 15, 1990, 26years after construction began. The 1990 opening ceremony of I-35E in downtown Saint Paul was attended by a group of highway experts from the Soviet Union, and both the US and Soviet national anthems were played.|$|E
