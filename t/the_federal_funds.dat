5|$|Revolving {{funds are}} similar to the Proprietary funds used by state and local governments for business-like activities.

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{all other}} {{stations}} {{on the line}} from Lincoln west, Ayer has no dedicated station parking, despite serving over 400 passengers per day. The lots adjacent to the station are privately owned and serve local businesses, but are often illegally used by commuters using the station. The 30-space Nashua River Rail Trail parking lot is available for commuters on weekdays; some commuters also use street parking and other business lots. In 2003, the town and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) began planning how to increase parking capacity. Five studies in six years concluded with plans for an $11 million, 400-space garage off Park Street, accessibility improvements to the station, and streetscape improvements for pedestrian access. The plans were reduced in scale due to traffic concerns and other issues. $3.2 million in FTA funds (originally intended for expanded parking at Littleton/Route 495 but later rejected) was committed to build a $4 million surface lot. However, the lot was delayed due to conflicts with businesses that would be displaced and the lack of a publicly owned pedestrian entrance (a requirement to use <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds).</b>|$|E

The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations.

25|$|In the United States, as of 2006, the Federal Reserve sets an {{interest}} rate target for <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>funds</b> (overnight bank reserves) market.

An amendment to the Metro's Compact on August 19, 2009, added the requirement for payments [...] "from dedicated funding sources" [...] by the Compact's participating jurisdictions. In June 2010, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell threatened to withhold Virginia's WMATA funding unless the composition of WMATA's board is modified to allow Virginia's Governor to appoint two of the four Virginia seats, instead of the localities. On June 17, 2010, Federal Transit Administrator Peter Rogoff required a formal commitment from Virginia to match its share of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> if the federal funding is to continue. On July 1, 2010, the WMATA Board of Directors agreed to provide matching funds without regard to McDonnell's request for Board seats. [...] Based on this agreement, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> were reconfirmed, and WMATA was able to proceed with a contract to purchase 428 new metrorail cars.
