5|$|The cricketer {{refused to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{candidacy}} was simply {{there to make}} up the numbers, and he told Bolte as much. The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954–55 grade cricket finals. Loxton took 7 wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title {{for the first time in}} 32 years, and was hailed as a local hero. It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets. In a close-run contest, the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count. He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s, claiming that it was too soft towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time. Loxton polled 35.70% of the first preferences, well behind Pettiona's 47.25%, but received almost all of the DLP's 13.66% of the vote as preferences to end with 50.04%. The result helped bring Bolte's Liberals to power, and they stayed in office until 1982, by which time Loxton had retired.|$|E

Yes, a colossal {{psychological}} blow has been dealt, but al-Qaeda is no longer a mere organisation, but a global brand, an idea, a philosophy that now has its first Saudi martyr from the holy lands of Islam.|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} 1930s, Waugh's {{inclination}} to Catholic and conservative polemics affected his {{standing with the}} general reading public. The Campion biography is said by David Wykes to be [...] "so rigidly biased {{that it has no}} claims to make as history". The pro-fascist tone in parts of Waugh in Abyssinia offended readers and critics and prevented its publication in America. There was general relief among critics when Scoop, in 1938, indicated a return to Waugh's earlier comic style. Critics had begun to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wit had been displaced by partisanship and propaganda.|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Davies {{was cast}} as Daniel {{because he was}} one of the writer-producers' {{favorite}} character actors, and they <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> [...] "transformative quality [...] the tremendous intelligence that seems to emanate from him … seemed perfect for [...]" [...] The producers constructed the role around Davies based on his performances in Rescue Dawn and Solaris. When Davies met costume designer Roland Sanchez, he was wearing a thin black tie. [...] Sanchez merged this [...] "cool, edgy look" [...] with his idea for the character's clothes: a [...] "nerdy" [...] loosely woven dress shirt from J.Crew. Davies reportedly took a [...] "" [...] on physics to understand the character better. Showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse called Daniel Faraday [...] "an obvious shout-out to Michael Faraday, scientist and physicist". Faraday was originally planned to be a recurring role.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Lyon observes, [...] "The plot {{revolves}} around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke." [...] While noting that the device is [...] "striking", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely [...] "warped" [...] individuals. She suggests that [...] "Neal and Berti... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other." [...] Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal seems to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> own violent acts are simply part {{of some kind of}} [...] "elaborate fiction". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, [...] "It was like a book... a book!" ...|$|E
500|$|Æthelbald's {{rebellion}} {{was supported}} by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though {{they appear to have}} been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted [...] "in the western part of Selwood", and western nobles may have backed Æthelbald because they resented the patronage Æthelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think {{it is more likely that}} it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east. Æthelwulf insisted that Judith should sit beside him on the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was [...] "without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles".|$|E

[...] Lance Reddick {{was told that he}} was auditioning for the part of [...] "Arthur Stevens", a [...] "ruthless corporate recruiter", instead of Matthew Abaddon. [...] "Matthew" [...] and [...] "Abaddon" [...] were revealed as season 4 clue words in the alternate reality game Find 815. [...] The writers chose the character's surname after they read the Wikipedia article on Abaddon, which states that it means [...] "place of destruction". [...] The writer-producers were originally interested in having Reddick play Mr. Eko during the second season, however, he was busy starring on HBO's The Wire.

500|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 2 September, the mutineers messaged the Chilean {{government}} {{with a more}} [...] "sophisticated" [...] list of twelve demands. Meanwhile, further south, junior members of the navy in the main naval base of Talcahuano joined the mutiny, taking several vessels in the process. Several of these sailed north to join the other rebels, while two cruisers, a few destroyers and submarines remained to guard the base. Other bases joined the now-full-fledged rebellion as well, including the Second Air Group based in Quintero. With so many rebels appearing, it was feared by many that the plethora of unemployed workers would join. The government attempted to solicit aid from the United States {{in the form of}} military intervention or war materiel (including two submarines and bombs capable of penetrating the armor of Almirante Latorre), but they were rebuffed both publicly and privately. Acting Vice President Manuel Trucco now found himself in an undesirable position; he had to defeat the rebels before more units joined and bolstered their forces, but if he was too harsh, there was a risk that the populace would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> policies were too similar to the former dictator Ibáñez del Campo. Trucco decided on a path of reconciliation. He sent a naval admiral, Edgardo von Schroeders, to negotiate with the mutineers. They met on board Almirante Latorre, where von Schroeders, seeing a potential split between sailors angry over their pay versus others with a more political agenda, tried to divide them along these lines and get them to surrender. However, a plea from the approaching southern fleet, asking for them to wait before any possible settlement, sealed the matter for the time being and von Schroders flew back to the capital.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Chicago game, the Michigan {{football}} players unanimously elected Curtis as captain of the 1906 football team. The players noted that Curtis was given the honor both due to his ability {{as a player and}} [...] "the desire of the team to evidence their belief that the ruling out of Curtis from the Chicago game on Thanksgiving day for alleged unnecessary roughness in play was entirely unjustified." [...] The selection of Curtis was reported to be [...] "peculiarly pleasing to Ann Arbor's students ... because they <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> disqualification in the Chicago match was a great injustice and mistake." ...|$|E

Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's [...] "Guess I'm Dumb", [...] "Let Him Run Wild, and [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew".

2500|$|Albino Luciani's {{views on}} Humanae vitae have been debated. Journalist John L. Allen, Jr. claims that [...] "it's {{virtually}} certain that John Paul I {{would not have}} reversed Paul VI’s teaching, particularly since he was no doctrinal radical. Moreover, as Patriarch in Venice some had seen a hardening of his stance on social issues {{as the years went}} by." [...] According to Allen [...] "...it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae Vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did, and probably would not have treated it as a quasi-infallible teaching. It would have remained a more 'open' question". Other sources take a different view and note that during his time as Patriarch of Venice that [...] "Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church's prohibition of contraception", though while not condoning the sin, he was tolerant of those who sincerely tried and {{failed to live up to}} the Church's teaching. The book states that [...] "...if some people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> compassion and gentleness in this respect implies he was against Humane Vitae one can only infer it was wishful thinking on their part and an attempt to find an ally in favor of artificial contraception." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Gilmour began to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd, so in 1978 he {{channelled}} his ideas into the eponymous solo album, David Gilmour, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting skills. Music written during the finishing {{stages of the}} album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became [...] "Comfortably Numb", which was included on The Wall. The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of The Wall album and subsequent film, compounded by The Final Cuts virtually being a Roger Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, About Face, in 1984. He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He has since admitted that he also used the album {{to distance himself from}} Pink Floyd. He toured Europe and the US along with support act the Television Personalities, who were promptly dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy unwisely revealed Syd Barrett's address on stage. Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit. When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced the Dream Academy, who had a US top ten hit with [...] "Life in a Northern Town" [...] in 1986.|$|E
