500|$|This {{episode was}} the first to {{prominently}} feature Ned Flanders {{and the rest of the}} Flanders family, and contained the first appearances of Maude and Rod Flanders. Maggie Roswell was given the role of Maude, Ned's loving wife, and became a regular cast member with this episode. She had previously played supporting parts in the show's first season. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, commented on Roswell's acting: [...] "Maggie has been blessed with a skill in creating one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> to create: the 'normal sound,' whatever that is. So she can easily slip into the gal next door [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|With Frusciante {{in place}} and Peligro still on drums, the band {{embarked}} on a small tour and began writing music for the next album. It wasn't long though before the band felt they needed to part ways with Peligro as well, who had his own personal drug problems. Peligro, who helped co-write [...] "Stone Cold Bush", [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] and [...] "Sexy Mexican Maid" [...] for the Mother's Milk album, was fired in late November 1988. Kiedis said {{it was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> he had to do because they considered Peligro a good friend.|$|E

I was trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} at Record Two Studio in Comptche, California. While recording the song, {{it began to}} develop differently from the original vision. Pike stated that the [...] "song was getting slower and slower and then it got weird. We started tripping out and second guessing ourselves." [...] Recording the album was difficult. Pike recalled that [...] "there was so much to memorize for that album, {{and we had to}} do it in like three different sections because a reel-to-reel only holds 22 minutes. It was really cool, but it was one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> I've ever done in in my life." [...] Sleep were in the studio for one month then went home to rehearse and returned for another month. Pike noted that they ended up with two or three different versions of the song.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have enjoyed}} the series' story and writing. Santos enjoyed how Steins;Gate misleads the viewer by {{spending}} {{the first half}} of the series on comedy before turning into a thriller for the second half, and how the finale revisits the events of the first episode, making for a [...] "rock-solid climax". Rebecca Silverman at Anime News Network called the pacing of the first half uneven, with exciting scientific discoveries coupled with less interesting sequences about daily life in the laboratory and maid café visits, but found the second half of the show to be a step up; she enjoyed the added urgency, and how the characters were given development and how the viewer was given insight into their motivations from {{the first half of}} the series. Similarly, Aiden Foote at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews said that the first half, while entertaining, is lacking in direction. Eisenbeis noted the rules for how time travel works as well defined, which he called among <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> to do when writing time travel fiction. Pierce Drew at The Fandom Post enjoyed the story and characters, but noted that Luka adds very little to the story.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her live action roles, Roswell did some voice acting in animated films and shows, including the voice of Teegra in Fire and Ice from 1983. This led to her being hired on the animated television series The Simpsons in 1989. Her first appearance was in the season one episode [...] "Homer's Night Out", in which she voiced the character Princess Kashmir (a belly dancer who seduces Homer). Out of the total thirteen episodes of the first season, Maggie Roswell appeared in four; however, they were only minor roles. Maggie Roswell did not become a regular cast member {{until the middle of}} the second season in the episode [...] "Dead Putting Society" [...] (1990), with the introduction of Maude Flanders (neighbor to the Simpson family and the loving wife of Ned Flanders). Maggie Roswell went on to voice other recurring characters on the show, such as Helen Lovejoy (the reverend's wife), Miss Hoover (an elementary school teacher), and Luann Van Houten (a housewife and mother), as well as several more one-time characters and background characters. Fellow Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright wrote in her autobiography that [...] "Maggie Roswell has been blessed with a skill in creating one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> to create: the 'normal sound,' whatever that is. So she can easily slip into the gal next door or any number of assorted reporters, medical students, jury members, accountants, scientists and moms." [...] Roswell was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on The Simpsons. She also received a 1997 Annie Award nomination in the category [...] "Best Individual Achievement: Voice Acting by a Female Performer in a TV Production" [...] for her role as Sharry Bobbins in the episode [...] "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious", but lost to June Foray.|$|E

[...] said Zorn, [...] "I have to be there with them, and that's why I started playing saxophone, so that I could meet musicians. I still feel that I have to earn a player's trust before they can play my music. At the end of the day, I want players to say: this was fun—it was a lot of fucking work, and it's one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> I've ever done, but it was worth the effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|Investors are {{generally}} most attracted to those new companies distinguished by their strong co-founding team, a balanced [...] "risk/reward" [...] profile (in which high risk {{due to the}} untested, disruptive innovations is balanced out by high potential returns) and [...] "scalability" [...] (the likelihood that a startup can expand its operations by serving more markets or more customers). Attractive startups generally have lower [...] "bootstrapping" [...] (self-funding of startups by the founders) costs, higher risk, and higher potential return on investment. Successful startups are typically more scalable than an established business, {{in the sense that}} the startup has the potential to grow rapidly with a limited investment of capital, labor or land. Timing has often been the single most important factor for biggest startup successes, while at the same time it's identified to be one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> to master by many serial entrepreneurs and investors.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{a part in}} the {{suspense}} drama Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Case of Miss Faulkner and her desire to play more-challenging roles, Entwistle was often cast as a comedian, most often the attractive, good-hearted ingénue. In 1929 she told a reporter:"I would rather play roles that carry conviction. Maybe it is because they are the easiest and yet <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> for me to do. To play any kind of an emotional scene I must work up to a certain pitch. If I reach this in my first word, the rest of the words and lines take care of themselves. But if I fail, I have to build up the balance of the speeches, and in doing this the whole characterisation falls flat. I feel that I am cheating myself. I don't know whether other actresses get this same reaction or not, but it does worry me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 1942, he {{surrendered}} to the Japanese. He was taken to prison-camps first at Sukabumi and then to Bandung. Van der Post was famous {{for his work in}} maintaining the morale of prisoners of many different nationalities. Along with others, he organised a [...] "camp university" [...] with courses from basic literacy to degree-standard ancient history, and he also organized a camp farm to supplement nutritional needs. He could also speak some basic Japanese, which helped him greatly. Once, depressed, he wrote in his diary: [...] "It is one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> in this prison life: the strain caused by being continually in the power of people who are only half-sane and live in a twilight of reason and humanity." [...] He wrote about his prison experiences in A Bar of Shadow (1954), The Seed and the Sower (1963) and The Night of the New Moon (1970). Japanese film director Nagisa Oshima based his film Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1982) on the last two of these books.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Mirren played Alfred Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville in the 2012 biopic Hitchcock, {{directed}} by Sacha Gervasi {{and based on}} Stephen Rebello's non-fiction book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho. The film centres on the pair's relationship during the making of Psycho, a controversial horror film that {{became one of the}} most acclaimed and influential works in the filmmaker's career. It became a moderate arthouse success and garnered a lukewarm critical response from critics, who felt that it suffered from [...] "tonal inconsistency and a lack of truly insightful retrospection." [...] Mirren was universally praised for her play however, with Roger Ebert noting that the film depended most on her portrayal, which he found to be [...] "warm and effective." [...] Her other film that year was The Door, a claustrophobic drama film {{directed by}} István Szabó, based on the Hungarian novel of the same name. Set at the height of communist rule in 1960s Hungary, the story of the adaptation centres on the abrasive influence that a mysterious housekeeper wields over her employer and successful novelist, played Martina Gedeck. Mirren found the role [...] "difficult to play" [...] and cited doing it as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> [...] ever done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dillahunt took {{inspiration}} from Andrew Cunanan, {{the man who}} killed Gianni Versace, when he recalled the brutality in which Cunanan murdered a man just for his car. Dillahunt recalls how an FBI profiler noted that this type of rage is typically directed toward someone the perpetrator knows, yet Cunanan managed to pull some element from his own life and place it on this random person who attempted to stand his ground against the would-be carjacker. To Dillahunt, that was how he wanted to approach Krug. To him, Mari actually shows that she is not afraid of Krug, which causes him to go [...] "crazy". That being said, the actor felt like the scene where his character rapes Mari was one of <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>things</b> emotionally to film. He notes that part of him was happy that Sara Paxton was cast as Mari, because they had worked together in the past, so they knew each other. On the other hand, he felt uncomfortable acting out such a scene with a person he considered to be a friend. Paxton echoed his sentiments to Craven, who stated the actress expressed to him a greater feeling of trust that the person who would have to do these [...] "horrible" [...] things to her was someone she knew, and as a result made them at least partially more bearable to act.|$|E
