5|$|Planning for Metro {{began with}} the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955 which {{attempted}} to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of 1980. In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington. Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for federal legislation creating a moratorium on freeway construction through July 1, 1962. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Capital</b> Transportation Agency's 1962 Transportation in <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Capital</b> Region report anticipated much of the present Blue Line route in Virginia with the route following the railroad right-of-way inside Arlington and Alexandria to Springfield. It did not include a route in Prince George's County. The route continued in rapid transit plans until the formation of WMATA.|$|E
5|$|The NCTA's November 1962 Transportation in <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Capital</b> Region report {{included}} {{a proposal for}} an 89-mile (143km), $793 million rail system. The {{total cost of the}} proposed highway and rail system was less than the 1959 plan due to the elimination of controversial freeways. The plan was supported by President Kennedy, but opposed by highway advocates in Congress who reduced the rail system to only 23-miles (37km) within the District of Columbia. However, that proposal was defeated in Congress shortly after President Kennedy's death. The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 passed Congress, which promised 66% federal funding for urban mass transportation projects. Encouraged by the new act, the NCTA recommended the formation of a private entity or a multi-state authority to operate the system using more non-federal funds. On September 8, 1965, President Johnson signed <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Capital</b> Transportation Act of 1965 approving the construction of a 25-mile (40km) rapid transit system.|$|E
