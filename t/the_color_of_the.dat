Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane.

The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It was <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green {{was the color of}} growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E

5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1874 {{as a species}} of Boletus, the fungus has also been classified in the genus Leccinum because of the scabers on the stipe, or in Tylopilus because of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spore print. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that the lilac-brown bolete was separate from both of these genera, and merited placement in a new genus. Sutorius was created to contain this bolete and the closely related Australian species S.australiensis.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smoke {{indicates}} {{the results to}} the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{spore print}} is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm.

Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the inner}} walls of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm.

A fifteen-card Booster Pack will typically contain one rare (gold), three uncommons (silver), ten commons (black), and one basic land (colored black, as commons). Sets prior to Shards of Alara contained eleven commons instead of a basic land.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} (Sitta carolinensis) {{is a small}} songbird of the nuthatch family which breeds in old-growth woodland {{across much}} of temperate North America. It is a stocky bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, and the face and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine subspecies differ mainly in <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body plumage.|$|E
5|$|With its short stipe {{and sticky}} cap, S.quiescens {{is similar to}} S.brevipes.

5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears {{to be dependent on}} light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, a change in <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also {{be heard over the}} lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
