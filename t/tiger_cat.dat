2500|$|As the air defences {{were now}} alert, another five Sea Harriers {{coming in from}} the east, were {{received}} by heavy 35 and 20mm AAA, both from GADA and the Air Force's Grupo 1. [...] Ingress was from the north at low level. [...] The attackers used a combination of 1000lb bombs and cluster bombs; a fuel depot was left in flames and minore damage was inflicted on the airport facilities. [...] GADA claimed to have [...] shot down two aircraft that morning, one to 35mm fire, the other to a <b>Tiger</b> <b>Cat</b> missile. [...] British sources, whilst conceding that the reaction of the ground defences was intense, indicate only a 20mm hit on the tail of the Sea Harrier piloted by Lt. Cdr. David Morgan. In fact, no British aircraft were lost.|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{this same}} {{part of the}} great Southwest lives a smaller cousin named Ocelot, often called <b>Tiger</b> <b>Cat.</b> Ocelot is only a little bigger than Black Pussy, whom you all know, and in shape is very like her. He also has a lovely coat. It is yellow, not a deep, rich yellow like Jaguar's, but a light yellow, thickly covered with black spots. On his cheeks and {{the back of his neck}} are black lines, and his tail is ringed with black. He likes best country where the brush is very thick and thorny, for there he can hunt in safety, with little fear of being hunted by man. Because of his smaller size, he lives chiefly on small animals, birds and reptiles. He {{sometimes}} kills and eats big Snakes. When he happens to live near man, he robs the Hen roosts just as Yowler does. In all his ways he is like the other members of the Cat family.|$|E
60|$|But, {{though he}} did not bring the family mansion, Truesdell did bring {{something}} {{in the way of a}} family inheritance that was more lasting than brick or stone. He brought one end of the Truesdell-Curtis family feud. And when a Curtis bought the Rancho de los Olmos, sixteen miles from the Cibolo, there were lively times on the pear flats and in the chaparral thickets off the Southwest. In those days Truesdell cleaned the brush of many a wolf and <b>tiger</b> <b>cat</b> and Mexican lion; and one or two Curtises fell heirs to notches on his rifle stock. Also he buried a brother with a Curtis bullet in him on the bank of the lake at Cibolo. And then the Kiowa Indians made their last raid upon the ranches between the Frio and the Rio Grande, and Truesdell at the head of his rangers rid the earth of them to the last brave, earning his sobriquet. Then came prosperity in the form of waxing herds and broadening lands. And then old age and bitterness, when he sat, with his great mane of hair as white as the Spanish-dagger blossoms and his fierce, pale-blue eyes, on the shaded gallery at Cibolo, growling like the pumas that he had slain. He snapped his fingers at old age; the bitter taste to life did not come from that. The cup that stuck at his lips was that his only son Ransom wanted to marry a Curtis, the last youthful survivor of the other end of the feud.|$|E
60|$|The {{fact that}} {{not one of these}} species is Australian or nearly allied to any Australian form, is {{strongly}} corroborative of the opinion that Timor has never formed a part of that country; as in that case some kangaroo or other marsupial animal would almost certainly be found there. It is no doubt very difficult to account for the presence of some of the few mammals that do exist in Timor, especially the <b>tiger</b> <b>cat</b> and the deer. We must consider, however, that during thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, these islands and the seas between them have been subjected to volcanic action. The land has been raised and has sunk again; the straits have been narrowed or widened; many of the islands may have been joined and dissevered again; violent floods have again and again devastated the mountains and plains, carrying out to sea hundreds of forest trees, as has often happened during volcanic eruptions in Java; and it does not seem improbable that once in a thousand, or ten thousand years, there should have occurred such a favourable combination of circumstances as would lead to the migration of two or three land animals from one island to another. This is all that we need ask to account for the very scanty and fragmentary group of Mammalia which now inhabit the large island of Timor. The deer may very probably have been introduced by man, for the Malays often keep tame fawns; and it may not require a thousand, or even five hundred years, to establish new characters in an animal removed to a country so different in climate and vegetation as is Timor from the Moluccas. I have not mentioned horses, which are often thought to be wild in Timor, because there are no grounds whatever for such a belief. The Timor ponies have every one an owner, and are quite as much domesticated animals as the cattle on a South American hacienda.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Henry James in {{commenting on}} Browning's rich and ample London period with [...] "its felicities and prosperities of every sort," [...] {{says that in}} contemplating [...] "the {{wonderful}} Browning ... the accomplished, saturated, sane, sound man of the London world {{and the world of}} culture," [...] it was impossible not to believe that [...] "he had arrived somehow, for his own deep purposes, at the enjoyment of a double identity," [...] so dissociated were the poet and the [...] "member of society." [...] Phillips Brooks, who met Browning in England in 1865-6, was impressed by his fullness of life and said he was [...] "very like some of the best of Thackeray's London men." [...] In public and on ordinary social occasions Browning {{is said to have been}} frank, charming, friendly--"more agreeable," [...] Mary Anderson said, [...] "than distinguished." [...] With intimate friends, however, the poet had quite another sort of charm. [...] "To a single listener," [...] says Mr. Gosse, with whom he was on familiar terms, [...] "the Browning of his own study was to the Browning of a dinner party as a <b>tiger</b> <b>cat</b> is to a domestic cat. In such conversation his natural strength came out. His talk assumed the volume and the tumult of a cascade. His voice rose to a shout, sank to a whisper, ran up and down the gamut of conversational melody. Those whom he was expecting will never forget his welcome, the loud trumpet-note from the other end of the passage, the talk already in full flood at a distance of twenty feet. Then, in his own study or drawing-room, what he loved was to capture his visitor in a low armchair's 'sofa-lap of leather,' and from a most unfair vantage of height to tyrannize, to walk around the victim, in front, behind, on this side, on that, weaving magic circles, now with gesticulating arms thrown high, now groveling on the floor to find some reference in a folio, talking all the while, a redundant turmoil of thoughts, fancies, and reminiscences flowing from those generous lips." ...|$|E
