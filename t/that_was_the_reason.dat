5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1976, while Vietnam and Kampuchea {{publicly}} {{appeared to}} be improving their relationships, the private suspicions of both countries' leadership grew. From the Vietnamese perspective, they were the patron of genuine Marxist–Leninist revolutions in South East Asia, so it was vital for them to exercise control over the Kampucheans and the Laotians. Indeed, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> North Vietnam supported the Khmer Rouge during their fight against the Lon Nol regime, {{in the hope that}} the Kampuchean communists would adopt a pro-Vietnamese line upon their victory in the same way the Pathet Lao had done. However, their hopes were dashed as early as 1973, because North Vietnamese military formations operating in Khmer Rouge-occupied territories were occasionally subjected to armed attacks by their own allies. The Vietnamese position inside Kampuchea was further weakened after the end of the war, as there were no pro-Vietnamese elements left within the Kampuchean Communist Party.|$|E

In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series.
