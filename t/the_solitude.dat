25|$|Up until 1899 Ireland {{played all}} their home {{international}}s in Belfast, {{with their first}} international being played at Bloomfield.

During the 1890s <b>the</b> <b>Solitude</b> Ground, the home stadium of Cliftonville, hosted 11 home internationals. In the early 20th century occasional internationals were also played at Grosvenor Park, the then home of Distillery, and the Balmoral Showgrounds.|$|E

25|$|Teresa {{entered a}} Carmelite Monastery of the Incarnation in Ávila, Spain, on 2 November 1535. She found herself {{increasingly}} in disharmony with the spiritual malaise prevailing at the monastery. Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of cloister — {{designed to protect}} and strengthen the spirit and practice of prayer — became so lax that it actually lost its very purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, spoiled the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vain conversations. These violations of <b>the</b> <b>solitude</b> absolutely essential to progress in genuine contemplative prayer grieved Teresa {{to the extent that}} she longed to do something.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there were}} some {{brighter}} moments: on 7 February 1891 an Ireland team featuring Jack Reynolds and four-goal hero Olphert Stanfield defeated Wales 7–2, providing Ireland with their second win. Reynolds international performances attracted the interest of West Bromwich Albion who signed him in March 1891, however it was later discovered that Reynolds was actually English. On 3 March 1894 at <b>the</b> <b>Solitude</b> Ground in Belfast, after thirteen attempts Ireland finally avoided defeat to England, the team that included Fred Spiksley and Reynolds, who had since switched allegiances, Ireland gained a 2–2 draw. Goals from Stanfield and W.K. Gibson inspired Ireland {{to come back from}} 2–0 down to gain a 2–2 draw.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – {{they just want to}} do it when they get to the surface. <b>The</b> <b>solitude</b> they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E
25|$|Harris captained England {{in four of}} his six internationals. He {{made his}} debut in 1904 when the English {{defeated}} Scotland 1-0 and the following year wore the captain's armband {{for the first time}} in a 1-1 draw with Ireland. In 1905 he also played an international against Wales, not as captain, and scored one of England's three goals. His last three internationals came in 1906 and he captained his country in all of them, including a 5-0 demolition of Ireland at <b>the</b> <b>Solitude</b> Ground where he scored a goal. He played club football at Cambridge University and with Old Westminsters; he was also a member of the Corinthian club, making 60 appearances between 1903 and 1910, scoring 57 goals including five in an 11–3 victory over a Manchester United side on 26 November 1904. He appeared once for England Amateurs, captaining the side in their inaugural international, in 1906, against France. The match, which is recognized as a full international by the French FA, was won by England 15-0, and Harris scored seven times.|$|E

25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Antonio Giovinazzi set the fastest time for Carlin in the opening practice session with a lap of two minutes and 13.829 seconds, nearly eight-tenths of a second faster than anyone else on the track. His closest challenger was Felix Rosenqvist who fought Giovinazzi for the top spot. Markus Pommer was third-fastest, ahead of the Japanese trio of Kenta Yamashita, Sekiguchi and Kanamaru. Cassidy, Lance Stroll, Mitsunori Takaboshi and Alexander Albon rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was red flagged twice: firstly for Jake Dennis twenty minutes into the session by crashing into the right-hand wall at <b>the</b> <b>Solitude</b> Esses after sustaining a puncture, and secondly for Callum Ilott when he impacted the barrier at the left-hand turn before Faraway corner with nine minutes left. Two other drivers, Sims and Zhi Cong Li, crashed at Lisboa turn but no stoppage was necessitated as both cars were retrieved from the track without difficulty.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. Félix da Costa set a late provisional pole position lap time of two minutes and 11.535 seconds, two-tenths of a second faster than Ilott who held the pole until Félix da Costa's time. Rosenqvist was third-fastest, ahead of Yamashita in fourth and Juncadella fifth. Sette Cãmara, Norris, Cassidy, Hughes and Sam MacLeod completed the top-ten provisional starting positions. Sims was the fastest driver not to record {{a time in the}} top ten and was 1.065 seconds off Félix da Costa's pace. He was followed by Maini, Russell, Anthoine Hubert and Günther with Ticktum, Pedro Piquet, Chang Wing Chung, Nikita Mazepin and Joel Eriksson completing the top-twenty fastest drivers. The session was red flagged four times: firstly for Yamashita when his wheel became detached from his car, possibly from a split rim, the second was for Sims who was stranded in the centre of Lisboa corner's run-off area, Norris impacted the San Francisco Bend barriers and Eriksson hit <b>the</b> <b>Solitude</b> Esses wall, triggering the third stoppage, and the session ended early when Juncadella crashed heavily into the Fisherman's Bend turn barrier.|$|E
25|$|Rosenqvist {{tried again}} at passing Verstappen {{entering}} Lisboa corner but the latter again held his position. Auer upfront was now holding a two-second {{advantage over the}} rest of the field, with the hope that no accidents would occur that would necessitate the safety car's deployment. However this would not happen as on the fourth lap, Verstappen lost control of his vehicle under braking in <b>the</b> <b>Solitude</b> Esses and broke his front-left suspension in an impact with the wall. This caused his wheel to dangle off the car along with him sustaining a rear-left puncture. Verstappen lost all turning room while attempting to get round the Melco hairpin but returned to the pit lane and into retirement. In the group behind Latifi was overtaken by King while Coletti was being caught by Fuoco and Serrallés. The safety car was required on the same lap when MacLeod crashed and blocked half the track at Paiol corner since no recovery cranes were in that area of the track. Confusion was created under the safety car as it did not pick up race leader Auer but Goddard instead. Gelael returned to the pit lane to stop him impeding other drivers and retired. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap seven and racing resumed with Auer leading Rosenqvist.|$|E

25|$|After {{his victory}} in the {{qualification}} race, Vernay started from pole position with Ericsson starting alongside, with Mortara and Bottas on row two. Due to damage inflicted in his spectacular accident the previous day, Boyd did not start, thus leaving the grid at 28 cars. Once again, Ericsson made an awful getaway, with Bottas and Mortara both slotting in behind a fast-starting Vernay. Into Lisboa, Ricciardo got alongside Ericsson as they battled for fourth with the Australian brushing {{the wall and the}} two continued side-by-side into San Francisco, with Ricciardo again nudging the wall. Behind them, Vanthoor left his braking far too late for Lisboa, and mounted over Chilton, which caused the teenage Briton to retire on the spot. Ricciardo's clip with the wall caused a left-rear puncture, but he managed to carry on up the hill, until he crashed at the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>Solitude</b> Esses. His car rebounded off the wall, and into direct line {{of the rest of the}} field. No less than half a dozen cars impacted with the stricken car, and blocked the track which ultimately led to a red flag, and a race suspension. Also taken out in the incident were the third Carlin of Hartley, the Premas of Coletti and Zampieri, the Fortecs of Rosenzweig and McKenzie, and Ho. Imperatori was also involved, returning to the pits for a lengthy period, but returned to complete three laps towards the end. Vanthoor, with a damaged front wheel after his collision with Chilton, stopped just short of the accident site, and was thus able to continue in the race.|$|E
