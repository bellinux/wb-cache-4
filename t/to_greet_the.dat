5|$|When the Hinomaru {{was first}} introduced, the {{government}} required citizens <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> Emperor with the flag.

5|$|News of Nero's death reached Vespasian {{as he was}} {{preparing}} to besiege the city of Jerusalem. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome.

5|$|The {{successful}} crossing {{was greeted}} with enthusiastic cheers, the tunes of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come to entertain the crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles. L'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> crowds, although many had already rushed the steamers to leave, resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour.|$|E
5|$|When the Sultan {{appeared}} before the Fortress he saw the walls hung with red cloth, as though for a festive reception, and a single great cannon thundered once <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> mighty warrior monarch. The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts, although the attack was successfully repulsed. Despite being undermanned, and greatly outnumbered, the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army.|$|E
5|$|Almost 24 {{hours after}} the dramatics in Barcelona, a crowd of 500,000 people turned up {{on the streets of}} Manchester <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> United players, who paraded through the city in an open-top bus. As champions of Europe, Manchester United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup against Brazilian side Palmeiras in Tokyo.

5|$|Infighting between Barclay's {{subordinates}} repeatedly {{prevented the}} Russian commander from committing his forces to battle. Barclay's fellow generals and the Russian court viewed the constant retreat as {{a reluctance to}} fight; consequently, he was removed from command and replaced by Prince Mikhail Kutuzov on 29 August 1812. Although the 67-year-old General Kutuzov was not seen by his contemporaries as the equal of Napoleon, he possessed the ability to muster a good defence. He was favoured over Barclay because he was Russian whereas Barclay was of Scottish descent and officers subordinate to Barclay could accept Kutuzov, thereby uniting the army. On 18 August Kutuzov arrived at Sarevo <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> army.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 1923, President Harding died {{unexpectedly}} in San Francisco {{while on}} a speaking tour of the western United States. Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death. He dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> reporters who had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered {{the oath of office}} in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed.|$|E
5|$|Surviving hymns {{and songs}} from the Old Kingdom include the morning {{greeting}} hymns to the gods in their respective temples. A cycle of Middle-Kingdom songs dedicated to Senusret III (r. 1878–1839 BC) have been discovered at El-Lahun. Erman considers these to be secular songs used <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> pharaoh at Memphis, while Simpson considers them to be religious in nature but affirms that the division between religious and secular songs is not very sharp. The Harper's Song, the lyrics found on a tombstone of the Middle Kingdom and on Papyrus Harris 500 from the New Kingdom, was to be performed for dinner guests at formal banquets.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 {{event was}} hosted by Australia, {{although}} it was originally intended to be held jointly with New Zealand. England emerged as champions defeating Australia in extra time. England's win was unique in that it broke the southern hemisphere's dominance in the event.

5|$|At 05:10 on August 22, {{an advance}} guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island {{under the command}} of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been {{stationed}} on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle at}} the palace {{continued}} until guards surrendered to the revolutionaries the following morning. The radio station was first to fall, secured after a loyalist officer was killed and resistance collapsed. The armory was perhaps the easiest target, as a written order from Sallal was sufficient to open the storage facility, beat the royalists, and secure rifles, artillery and ammunition for the revolutionaries. The telephone exchange likewise fell without any resistance. At the Al-Wusul Palace, revolutionary units remained secure {{under the guise of}} granting and protecting diplomats and dignitaries staying there <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> new Imam of Yemen. By late morning on September 26, all areas of San'a were secure and the radio broadcast that Muhammad al-Badr had been overthrown by the new revolutionary government in power. Revolutionary cells in the cities of Taiz, Al-Hujja and the port city of Hodeida then began securing arsenals, airports and port facilities.|$|E

5|$|The festival {{takes place}} in late May or early June, to {{coincide}} with the full moon. It falls one week before the Christian feast of Corpus Christi. Events include several processions of holy icons and dances in and around the shrine of the Lord of Quyllurit'i. The culminating event for the indigenous non-Christian population takes place after the reappearance of Qullqa in the night sky; it is the rising of the sun after the full moon. Tens of thousands of people kneel <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> first rays of light as the sun rises above the horizon. The main event for the Church is carried out by ukukus, who climb glaciers over Qullqipunku and bring back crosses and blocks of ice to place along the road to the shrine. These are believed to be medicinal with healing qualities.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{entrance to}} the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the vyaktavyakta concept of Samkhya, where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap {{out of the cave}} walls towards the spectator as if trying <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> narrative.

5|$|For an {{hour the}} {{officers}} drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning {{detailed information about}} the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> French arrivals. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at Cavite, Rear-Admiral Don Ignacio María de Álava, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm's cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered more wine. The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing. Climbing into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby Pasig River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well-armed, one with a 32-pounder long gun and two with 24-pounder long guns, each supplemented by four swivel guns.|$|E
5|$|Franciscan Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695, {{and arrived}} in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696, {{accompanied}} by four companions. From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past {{the source of}} the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins. From there they followed the small Acté River to a Chak'an Itza town called Saklemakal. They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> visitors at the Chak'an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown, without success. The king of the Itza, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right.|$|E
5|$|New Hampshire {{was laid}} down on 1 May 1905 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. She was {{launched}} on 30 June 1906 and was christened by Hazel McLane, {{the daughter of}} John McLane, then the Governor of New Hampshire. The ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 19 March 1908; her first commander was Captain Cameron Winslow. After completing final fitting-out work, New Hampshire transported a Marine Expeditionary Regiment to Colón, Panama on 20 June, arriving six days later. She then {{made a series of}} visits to ports on the eastern coast of North America, including Portsmouth, New York, and Bridgeport, along with a stop in the Canadian province of Quebec. The ship was then overhauled in New York, followed by training exercises in the Caribbean Sea. On 22 February 1909, she participated in a Naval Review for President Theodore Roosevelt <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>the</b> return of the Great White Fleet in Hampton Roads, Virginia. During this period, Ernest King, later the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, served aboard the ship in the engine room.|$|E
