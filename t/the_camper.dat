5|$|Diary of a Camper occurs entirely {{within the}} Quake map DM6 ("The Dark Zone"). After {{exploring}} {{some of the}} area, the Rangers gather and decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. After they teleport into the room, a camper waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers—ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member—realize their comrades' fate and return fire from a distance, killing <b>the</b> <b>camper.</b> Examining the remains, they identify their foe as John Romero.|$|E

5000|$|Self-Government:One of {{the main}} goals of LPC is to teach campers responsibility. A method used in camps is for <b>the</b> <b>campers</b> to begin helping with various aspects of camp-life {{from the first day}} on. <b>The</b> <b>campers</b> learn how to prepare meals, to lead {{activities}} and games and organise different camp jobs. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>campers</b> lead and organise a whole day.|$|R

25|$|The small tent, {{available}} in either red/white or blue/gray stripes, was less popular {{and thus is}} less often seen today. It consists of {{a single piece of}} heavy canvas, with a strip of vinyl along the bottom acting as a reinforcement and splash guard. It fits over the side-door opening (and has a gap for one leg of the roof rack) as a sort of foyer or vestibule. It's big enough for two adults to stand inside, but little else, and was probably intended as a means of getting in and out of <b>the</b> <b>camper</b> in cold or wet weather.|$|E

25|$|A renaissance for Shamrock V {{began in}} 1962 with her {{acquisition}} by the Italian yachtsman Piero Scanu. He instigated a comprehensive three year overhaul commencing in 1967 with Shamrock V returning to <b>the</b> <b>Camper</b> and Nicholsons yard. The hull and deck received significant attention {{along with the}} modernisation of the systems and engines. The effects of this rebuild were to last {{the next twenty years}} during which a remarkable repeat of history was enacted when, in 1986, Shamrock V returned to the ownership of the Lipton Tea Company who donated her to the Museum of Yachting at Newport, Rhode Island. Another extensive restoration was instigated by her new owners and undertaken by Elizabeth Meyer in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{services}} of Charles Ernest Nicholson {{were once again}} employed to design the challenger and she was constructed at <b>the</b> <b>Camper</b> and Nicholsons yard in Gosport. Shamrock V was built from wood, with mahogany planking over steel frames and, most significantly, a hollow spruce mast. As a result of rule changes, {{she was the first}} British contender for the America's Cup to carry the Bermuda rig. Following her launch on 14 April 1930 she showed early promise on the British Regatta circuit winning 15 of 22 races. She also underwent continuous upgrading with changes to her hull shape, rudder, and modifications to the rig to create a more effective racing sail plan before departing to America in time for the 15th America's Cup.|$|E

Transportation to and from Philmont is the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>camper</b> and is not covered in the scholarships.|$|E
500|$|Well {{known for}} their playing skill {{and their ability to}} program game modifications, the Rangers {{conceived}} the idea to use Quake for filmmaking in August 1996 and released Diary of a Camper on October 26, 1996. The group's new demo surprised the Quake community by exploiting the game differently. According to Henry Lowood, Diary of a Camper contains the action and gore of previous gameplay demos, but {{in the context of a}} simple story instead of the usual deathmatch. A BusinessWeek article compared the events of the film to those of a typical deathmatch. Like many of its predecessors, the demo was recorded in Quakes networked multiplayer deathmatch mode, but [...] "it marked the transition from sports footage to moviemaking. The players were choreographed like actors, ... delivering their lines as plain text...." [...] Lowood stated that [...] "Diary of a Camper breaks with the demo movie as documented gameplay" [...] because the spectator's perspective is independent [...] "from that of any player/actor; the movie is not 'shot' from the first-person perspective of the shooter." [...] Lowood called the film a [...] "transformation of competitive play to ... minimal theatrical play", emphasized through the inclusion of references to gameplay, such as <b>the</b> <b>camper.</b>|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. <b>The</b> <b>camper</b> van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem was the smell of the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E

2500|$|The Louis August Jonas Foundation {{is guided}} by the {{philosophy}} of the founder. The mission is to [...] "develop in promising young people from diverse backgrounds a lifelong commitment to sensitive and responsible leadership for the betterment of their communities and world." [...] In following Jonas' mission, the camp nurtures leadership skills and the training that comes with practical experience. [...] Each camper gets the chance to be camp leader for one day. <b>The</b> <b>camper</b> in charge for that day is called the sachem—a word that refers to an Algonquian chief. Feedback, both from the staff and peers, is given to further gain from the experience. Staff members, typically graduate students or teachers, provide support.|$|E
2500|$|The Hurricane Floyd {{disaster}} {{was followed}} by what many judged {{to be a very}} slow federal response. Fully three weeks after the storm hit, Jesse Jackson complained to FEMA Director James Lee Witt on his CNN program Both Sides Now, [...] "It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... an awesome scene of tragedy. So there's a great misery index in North Carolina." [...] Witt responded, [...] "We're starting to move <b>the</b> <b>camper</b> trailers in. It's been so wet it's been difficult to get things in there, but now it's going to be moving very quickly.

[...] Nowell was known to invite his friends and their dogs over to film parodies of popular music videos; the dogs would pose as a band or an artist, dressed in corresponding costumes. In the early 1990s, Lou Dog disappeared for a week. Lou Dog was soon returned to Nowell, who later covered <b>the</b> <b>Camper</b> Van Beethoven song [...] "The Day That Lassie Went To The Moon", and changed it to [...] "Lou Dog Went to the Moon". Following Nowell's death in 1996, Lou Dog was cared for by Miguel. Lou Dog died on September 17, 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Multitool knives {{often have}} more than one blade, {{including}} an assortment of knife blade edges (serrated, plain, saws) as well as a myriad of other tools such as bottle openers, corkscrews, and scissors. A large tool selection is the signature of the Swiss Army Knife. These knives are produced by Victorinox and Wenger and issued to military services and sold to the public. [...] Similar to the Swiss Army knife is the German Army knife, with two blades opening from each side and featuring hard plastic grips and aluminum liners. [...] The U.S. Military utility knife (MIL-K-818), issued by the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, was made for many years by the Camillus Cutlery Company and Imperial Schrade as well as many other companies. [...] It was originally produced with carbon steel blades and brass liners (both vulnerable to corrosion), but with the onset of the Vietnam War was modified to incorporate all-stainless steel construction. [...] The current-issue U.S. military utility knife has textured stainless grips and four stainless blades/tools opening on both sides in <b>the</b> <b>camper</b> or scout pattern and has an extremely large clevis or bail.|$|E
50|$|The Scottish Parliament {{clerk and}} chief {{executive}} Paul Grice objected to the camp {{on the grounds that}} its presence at Holyrood infringes on the neutrality of parliament as well as preventing others from using the space, and was set up on the grounds without permission.

5000|$|Overnight campouts {{are what}} <b>campers,</b> unless in <b>the</b> outback session, do {{one night at}} camp.
