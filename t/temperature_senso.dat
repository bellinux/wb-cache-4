40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the ability of organometallic titanium-PANi hybrid materials as gas sensor at room temperature. To form the hybrid materials, commercially available polyaniline (PANi) powder were directly added into organometallic titanium sols which was synthesized using the sol gel method. The composite films were prepared via spin coating technique followed by electrode deposition for sensors fabrication. Five different organometallic titanium:PANi ratios namely 1 wt% to 5 wt% of PANi were prepared for this experiment. For gas sensing test, all samples were exposed to ethanol vapour. The sensing mode is based on the variation in the electrical conductivity due to the interaction between the gas molecules and the film. It was observed that the composite sensors required appropriate ratio to exhibit optimum sensing properties. This finding proved that the hybridization process is successful and offered much cheaper and easier method for fabrication of room <b>temperature</b> gas <b>senso...</b>|$|R

Housing and rooms which are the places of people’s life and family reunion are the important material conditions, but with the mass use of decoration materials {{and more and more}} wide daily article use, household environment hazards not only in the influence of the indoor humidity temperature, also {{in the size of the}} indoor harmful gas concentration. After indoor decoration, formaldehyde monitoring is the concentration of people’s attention. The related data statistics of Chinese environmental protection association show that the illness or death proportion due to indoor environment pollution every year has aroused the experts’ attention, and indoor environment pollution has become one of killer which has a serious influence of the modern human health. Nowadays, there are indoor environment monitoring instruments in market, which mainly aim at the harmful gas detection with single function, and expensive price. According to the market research, there is a need for comprehensive system of household indoor humidity temperature and harmful gas detection. This paper aims at it[1, 2].

40|$|Determining the g-factor of a single, {{isolated}} (anti) proton in {{a double}} Penning trap results from an accurate measurement of its cyclotron and spin precession frequency. The Larmor frequency can be determined by inducing radio frequency transitions between the two spin states and detecting the resulting spin state in the magnetic bottle field of the analysis trap [1]. The spin direction is monitored by measuring the respective axial frequency non-destructively with a high-Q tank circuit. The cyclotron frequency is detected {{in the same manner}} in the homogeneous magnetic field region of the precision Penning trap. To achieve a high-precision determination of the proton g-factor long storage times are required. This is realized by performing the experiment in a closed setup at 4 K yielding an ultra-high vacuum. A low vibrational Gifford-MacMahon cooler provides the cryogenic environment. end, a helical resonator is used which has been optimized according to different design criteria [2]. The Q-value was increased further by the use of the type-II superconducting alloy NbTi for winding the coil. The Q-values of two differently optimized cyclotron tank circuits (K 1,K 2) -witha resonator out of copper- {{as a function of the}} temperature are shown in figure 1. With a frequency of ν = 81 MHz and an inductance of L = 1. 7 μH aQ-value of 4500 was reached. The signal induced by the proton will be amplified by a first amplification stage operated at cryogenic temperatures providing a low Johnson noise as well as improving the signal-to-noise ratio. With these developments we aim for a relative uncertainty of δg/g = 10 − 9. mounting flange vacuum feedthrough analysis trap <b>temperature</b> <b>senso...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract:This pape r {{discusses}} a nanometer level precision alignment technique {{as applied}} to highly eff icient micro optics packaging using heat curable adhesives. To achieve a fast curing pro cess, we deposi t microw ave energy to the spot w here opt ical bonding is desi red. Conventional microw ave heating technique, how ever, as w e know it, relies on large mass rat io between the epoxy and the components to be bonded. In order to improve the efficiency of heat abso rption by the t iny amount of adhesive used fo r micro optics packaging, we pre-process the components to be bonded, by first polishing the bonding surfaces and then deposi ting a very thin layer of metalized f ilm on them. An infrared(IR) remote <b>temperature</b> <b>senso</b> r is utilized to monito r {{the temperature of the}} adhesive (to prevent over heating). A n automated sy stem can then adjust the pow er output of the microw ave so that a fairly constant curing temperature can be maintained. During the fast curing process, pre-alignment o f micro opt ics, such as fiber optic coupler, w ill inevitably suffer minor misalignment due to non-uniform heating of the components. To compensate for this side-ef fect, we have developed a real time alignment monito ring and feedback contro lled system. As an example to packag ing fiber couplers, such a sy stem can moni to r the insertion loss(IL) o f a component in real time while the adhesive is being cured by the microw ave energy. A 3 -dimensional piezo-elect ric t ransducer (PZT) i s employed to achieve the x-, y-, and z-axis alignment. A level of 10 nanometer alignment can be readi ly achieved which in turn leads to an IL sensit ivity of as smal l as 0. 004 dB. An improvement of a packaging ef ficiency as high as 150 times has been demonst rated, compared to conventional blind oven curing process. Yield of micro optics packaging is also expected to increase due to the use o f real time alignment pro cess.
