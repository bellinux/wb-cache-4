Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms.</b> Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E

In the auction, Sampdoria bid €6.5 million, but were outbid by Udinese, who paid €7.15 million to reclaim full ownership of Quagliarella.

To illustrate the above two particular challenges in Hong Kong, this article focuses on a citizen’s fight to run his own radio station, and the problems of consumer protection in the converged communications market.
