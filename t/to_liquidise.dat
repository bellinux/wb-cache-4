Playing with the Miles Davis groups, in particular, gave Coltrane the free musical space in which to apply harmonic ideas to stacked chords and substitutions. [...] Further, this open approach allowed Coltrane to arpeggiate three chords simultaneously, a style Monk initially taught Coltrane. The [...] "three-on-one chord approach" [...] gave the music a fluid, sweeping sound that was harmonically vertical. [...] Concepts of vertical (chordal) versus horizontal (melody) are key ideas {{in the work of}} George Russell, whom Coltrane had recorded with in September 1958. [...] This approach reflected Coltrane's fascination with third relations. Sometimes he used diminished chords, other times he used augmented chords. At times, Coltrane might use scales or licks in the passing keys instead of arpeggios. Coltrane employed these harmonic ideas during his [...] "sheets of sound" [...] stage in 1958. At other times, he would simply play rapid patterns of diminished-scales.|$|E
5000|$|The series {{attracted}} mixed reviews. Writing in New Statesman David Jays {{says that}} Lucy Gannon's characters are sharpened by indignation, and [...] "sorrow rounds {{them in the}} Dickensian manner". He also praises the show's use of classical music, rather than [...] "second guessing youthful tunes and getting it cringingly wrong". [...] The Observers Caroline Boucher praised Gannon's [...] "speedy character establishment" [...] and Henry's [...] "convincing" [...] portrayal. Adam Sweeting in The Guardian was more critical, suggesting it is [...] "old-fashioned melodrama", unfavorably contrasting Gannon with celebrated writers such as Jimmy McGovern and Alan Bleasdale. The use of classical music was [...] "disorienting", and Sweeting suggests that [...] "maybe education is too pressing and prickly an issue <b>to</b> be <b>liquidised</b> into soap opera, with its inevitable clich√©s and illogicalities." [...] Writing in the Financial Times, Christopher Dunkley says the drama has [...] "moments of interest", although Joe Joseph in The Times was very critical of the first series.|$|R
