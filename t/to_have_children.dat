40|$|L. A. Paul has {{recently}} argued that, {{on the standard}} model of rationality, individuals cannot make rational decisions about whether <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> or not. In this paper, I show that Paul’s arguments do not plausibly demonstrate that the standard model of rationality precludes rational decisions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child.</b> I argue that there are phenomenal and non-phenomenal values {{that can be used}} to determine the value that <b>having</b> a <b>child</b> will <b>have</b> for us and, in turn, {{that can be used to}} make rational decisions about whether <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> or not. I also argue that we can have an approximate idea of what it is like for us <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child,</b> even before we <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> and that, on the standard model, this is sufficient to make rational decisions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child...</b>|$|R

5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% {{of those}} who are married and able <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E

40|$|Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, {{this article}} investigates {{the role of}} attitudes, {{subjective}} norms and perceived behavioural control on intentions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child,</b> comparing their effect on intention <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> now with their effect on intention <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> during the next three years. Data from Norway (N = 1307) show that subjective norms {{have a significant effect}} on the timing of intentions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> is supported by their families and friends, the more likely they are to want a child now compared to within the next three years. Attitudes also {{have a significant effect on}} differences in the timing of intentions, for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able <b>to</b> cope with <b>having</b> <b>child</b> are more likely <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> now rather than within the next three years. This effect disappears when we control for demographic background variables, suggesting that the effect of perceived control on the timing of <b>having</b> a <b>child</b> varies considerably with personal circumstances...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the time frame of {{intentions}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child.</b> For both parents and childless people we compare those who want a child now with those who intend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> within the next three years. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and using data from Norway (N = 1307), we investigate the role of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on these two different time frames in fertility intention. The results show that subjective norms {{have a significant effect}} on the timing of intentions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> is supported by their families and friends, the more likely they are to want a child now compared to within the next three years. It also shows that positive attitudes {{have a significant effect on}} intending <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> now rather than later for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able <b>to</b> cope with <b>having</b> <b>child</b> are more likely <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> now rather than within the next three years. But this effect disappears when we control for demographic background variables, suggesting that the effect of perceived control on the timing of <b>having</b> a <b>child</b> varies considerably with personal circumstances...|$|R

She was claimed by Mitra-Varuna, but she lived with Manu and together they initiated the race of Manu. In this text, Idā is the goddess of the sacrificial meal. She is described as the Mānavi (daughter of Manu) and Ghṛtapadī (with the ghee-dripping foot) and she is represented by a cow, also known as Idā during a sacrifice. Pururavas is mentioned {{as the son of}} Ilā in the text.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent.

His father's family had Kashubian ancestry and was entitled to use the Brochwicz coat of arms (Brochwicz III). Hedwig von Sperling (1852–1925), Helene's younger sister, was married to Lieutenant General Georg von Manstein (1844–1913); the couple was unable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> so they adopted Erich.

5|$|Specific {{adverse events}} {{are related to}} the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a {{lower than normal}} blood clotting factor {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E
40|$|It seems {{natural to}} choose whether <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child</b> by {{reflecting}} {{on what it}} would be like <b>to</b> actually <b>have</b> a <b>child.</b> I argue that this natural approach fails. If you choose to become a parent, and your choice is based on projections about what you think it would be like for you <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. If you choose to remain childless, and your choice is based upon projections about what you think it would be like for you <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. This suggests we should reject our ordinary conception of how to make this life-changing decision, and raises general questions about how to rationally approach important life choices...|$|R

5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Duke's {{marriage}} in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young Princess was expected <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, the Dukes of Clarence and Kent, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children, and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to father the heir to the throne.|$|E
