5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Pei {{boarded a}} boat and sailed to San Francisco, then {{traveled}} by train to Philadelphia. What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Beaux-Arts style, rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by modern architecture, and also felt intimidated by {{the high level of}} drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.|$|E

5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional home economics principles if they could not be supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basic sciences.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Medicine {{remained}} the school's only functioning faculty until 1843 when the Faculty of Arts commenced <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newly constructed Arts Building and East Wing (Dawson Hall).

This title is marked upon the stone that stands before the Arts building, from where the Guards step off annually to commemorate Remembrance Day.|$|E
5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, {{there was an}} underemphasis in his message on the {{significance}} of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than {{a few of his}} earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{upon his}} arrival in Germany, Accum went {{to the town of}} Althaldensleben. There, the {{industrialist}} Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets, and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum. He remained only a short time in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, were collected in the two volume work, Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckmässige Anwendung, published in Berlin in 1826. It was the only work Accum published originally in German.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, {{notwithstanding}} his revolutionary sentiments, Smetana {{accepted the}} post of Court Pianist in Ferdinand's establishment in Prague Castle. He continued <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Piano Institute, and devoted himself increasingly to composition. His works, mainly for the piano, included the three-part Wedding Scenes, some of the music of which was later used in The Bartered Bride. He also wrote numerous short experimental pieces collected under the name Album Leaves, {{and a series of}} polkas. During 1853–54 he worked on a major orchestral piece, the Triumphal Symphony, composed to commemorate the wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph. The symphony was rejected by the Imperial Court, possibly {{on the grounds that the}} brief musical references to the Austrian national anthem were not sufficiently prominent. Undeterred, Smetana hired an orchestra at his own expense to perform the symphony at the Konvikt Hall in Prague on 26February 1855. The work was coolly received, and the concert was a financial failure.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E

5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was no different, with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E
5|$|The {{agitation}} {{was backed}} by Periyar's Self-Respect Movement and Justice Party. It also {{had the support of}} Tamil scholars like Maraimalai Adigal, Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan and Ilakkuvanar. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars {{were among the first to}} announce their opposition to the Hindi <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja conference at Velur. Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers. Moovalur Ramamirtham, Narayani, Va. Ba. Thamaraikani, Munnagar Azhagiyar, Dr. Dharmambal, Malar Mugathammaiyar, Pattammal and Seethammal were some of the women who were arrested for participating in the agitation. On 13 November 1938, the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference was convened to demonstrate women's support for the movement. The agitation was marked by anti-Brahmin sentiments as the protesters believed Brahmins were attempting to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil. Despite the general anti-Brahminism of the agitation, a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} {{remarkable}} for its time in several respects. It did not discriminate against pupils {{on the grounds}} of religious persuasion (at a time when most public schools had an Anglican emphasis); it included pupils from non-conformist and Jewish families. Also, unlike other established independent schools, it was a day school (although there were in early days a handful of boarders, no boarding department ever became established). It also promoted a practical and progressive scheme of education which was well ahead of its time. It was the first school in England to include science on the curriculum and to include scientific experiments as part of its teaching. It also offered education in commercial subjects. This did not, however, diminish the excellence of its <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subjects traditionally favoured by independent schools, and it sent classical and mathematical scholars to Oxford and Cambridge throughout the nineteenth century. These included the classicist, theologian and Shakespearean scholar Edwin Abbott Abbott (whose mathematical exploration of a world in other than three dimensions, Flatland, is still in print and who returned to the school as headmaster) and H. H. Asquith, who though educated as a classical scholar {{went on to become the}} British Prime Minister.|$|E
