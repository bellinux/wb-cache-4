Ono refused as {{she thought it was}} too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer at a press conference in April 1990, explaining that Ono [...] "actually said 'I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> it for 5.' So I said, 'Well ok, you know, let's see what we can do.' And we couldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Grey's Anatomy used a color-blind casting technique, {{resulting}} in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's races being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes' vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Meredith Grey, which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast. [...] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile," [...] said Rhimes, [...] "and after a while, they were like, 'We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that girl from Moonlight Mile." [...] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read {{for the role of}} Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, [...] "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.|$|E

500|$|Pompeo {{discovered}} Grey's Anatomy {{after an}} extended period of doing nothing in the acting profession. [...] Her agent suggested she audition amongst other projects. [...] While casting actresses for the part of Meredith Grey, series' creator Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile, and after a while, they were like, 'We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that girl from Moonlight Mile.' I spent time with her and got to know her, and then we started casting for the men." [...] She reported that Grey was not an easy role to cast because of the strong verbal possibilities. [...] Rhimes was informed that the actress in question was Pompeo, who had a deal in place with ABC, having previously tested for a pilot show on the network. It has been speculated that Pompeo was the first character to be cast, but when asked, she said she did not know of this. When asked of how she created Pompeo's character, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

5000|$|Brown's Louis Riel {{book was}} {{inspired}} by the alleged mental instability of Riel, and Brown's own anarchist politics, and he began his research for the book in 1998. Over the course of researching for the book, he shifted his politics {{over the course of several}} years until he was a libertarian. Regarding anarchy, Brown has said, [...] "I'm still an anarchist to the degree that I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should be aiming towards an anarchist society but I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> actually <b>get</b> there. <b>We</b> probably do need some degree of government." ...|$|R

"But one {{may feel}} things {{and are not}} able to do {{anything}} better for all that," [...] said Gwendolen, not smiling in return--the distance to which Deronda's words seemed to throw her chilling her too much. [...] "I begin to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>get</b> better by having people about us who raise good feelings. You must not be surprised at anything in me. I think it is too late for me to alter. I don't know how to set about being wise, as you told me to be." ...|$|R

They will guess that we shall probably attempt such a thing, and I {{have no doubt that}} they will move away, if they haven't done so already, and hide themselves among other rocks. Then if we dashed forward to the place where they had been, they would pour a volley into us and finish us at once; for if they were lying twenty yards away they ought certainly to hit every one of us, as they have eight shots to fire. At present I have no doubt they are talking, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>get</b> back to where we piled up the saddles and bales. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> defend ourselves better there than here. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> then talk matters over quietly." ...|$|R

[...] When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, [...] "There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents."

5000|$|Although {{he made an}} {{appearance}} himself on the programme (as the pseudo-fictional [...] "Craig Davis"), he regretted it even as he was making it: [...] "I didn't want people to think, 'Craig's reacting to it', because then they would <b>think,</b> 'how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> up Craig's nose even more?' So I did it, but I wasn't happy about it". In 2010, he further commented on his bitterness towards Francis' impersonations of him: [...] "What upset me was that it made people ridicule 'Rewind'. It should make people think about the garage scene, not some guy with a stupid rubber mask. I've got {{nothing to say to}} Leigh. He's not picking up awards or anything is he?"

5000|$|Although {{he was the}} man {{responsible}} for its technology, Farnsworth appeared only once on a television program. On July 3, 1957, he was a mystery guest ("Doctor X") on the CBS quiz show I've Got A Secret. He fielded questions from the panel as they unsuccessfully tried to guess his secret ("I invented electronic television."). For stumping the panel, he received $80 and a carton of Winston cigarettes. Host Garry Moore then spent a few minutes discussing with Farnsworth his research on such projects as high-definition television, flat-screen receivers, and fusion power.Farnsworth said, [...] "There had been attempts to devise a television system using mechanical disks and rotating mirrors and vibrating mirrors — all mechanical.

5000|$|In early January, it was {{announced}} that the band do a split with Such Gold for release the following month on No Sleep, however, it failed to materialise. On February 10, 2011, they announced signing with Rise/Velocity. The band had previously met a Velocity representative, Dave, who suggested the idea of signing the band with a Rise representative, Craig. The band went on tour with Streetlight Manifesto through the U.S. in February and March. The band went {{on a tour of the}} UK with This Time Next Year, supporting Set Your Goals in May. Recording for their Rise/Velocity debut was done in May and June with producer Andrew Wade. As Dangora mentions, the choice of Wade came down to the albums that he worked on previously as they were [...] "really good sonically ... and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the best out of us." [...] The album was going to sound similar to their previous album [...] "but improve on it ... with big sounding, loud guitars and catchy vocals." [...] Arsenault, on the other hand, said that Wade was recommended by Dave Shapiro from Velocity. The band went on the 2011 Summer Partery Tour with In Fear and Faith, Vanna, Close to Home, Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!, Ten After Two and Adestria throughout July and August. The band supported Cruel Hand, with The Greenery and Maker, for the Back to School Jam tour in September and October.|$|R
