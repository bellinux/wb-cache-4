50|$|High write loads in a {{flash memory}} cause stress on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> layer {{creating}} small disruptions in the crystal lattice called “oxide defects.” If {{a large number of}} such disruptions are created a short circuit develops between the floating gate and the transistor’s channel and the floating gate can no longer hold a charge. This is the root cause of flash wear-out (see Flash memory#Memory wear), which is specified as the chip’s “endurance.” In order to reduce the occurrence of such short circuits, floating gate flash is manufactured using a thick <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> (~100Å), but this slows erase when Fowler-Nordheim tunneling is used and forces the design to use a higher tunneling voltage, which puts new burdens on other parts of the chip.|$|E
5000|$|A charge {{trapping}} cell {{is relatively}} immune to such difficulties, since the charge trapping layer is an insulator. [...] A short circuit created by an oxide defect between the charge trapping layer {{and the channel}} will drain off only the electrons in immediate contact with the short, leaving the other electrons in place to continue to control the threshold voltage of the transistor. Since short circuits are less of a concern, a thinner <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> layer can be used (50-70Å) increasing the trapping layer’s coupling to the channel and leading to a faster program speed (with localized trapped charges) and erasing with lower tunneling voltages. The lower tunneling voltages, in turn, place less stress on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> layer, leading to fewer lattice disruptions.|$|E

30|$|The {{demand for}} low-power, high-speed, and {{high-density}} non-volatile memory devices has increased drastically {{over the past}} decade due to the growing market of consumer electronics. However, current flash memory devices are expected to face two major challenges in the near future: density and voltage scaling. The density of the memory is related to the gate length scaling which is constrained by the gate stack, precisely, the <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> thickness. In fact, the gate length is required to be adequate with the gate stack in order to maintain a good gate control and to avoid short channel effects. However, in conventional flash memories, the <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> thickness has a lower limit of 6 – 8 nm (depending on NOR or NAND structure) in order to avoid back-tunneling and thus leakage of charges which destroys the necessary retention characteristic of the memory (> 10 years). The second problem which needs to be solved is the high program and erase operating voltages. Once again, the limitation to operating voltage scaling is the inability to reduce gate stack thickness. In addition to the trade-off relationship between <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> thickness and retention characteristic of the memory where the retention of charges is exponentially degraded as the <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> thickness is scaled down, there exists another trade-off relationship between the <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> thickness and the resulting program time, where a thicker <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> causes the extension of the time needed for the charges to be transported from the channel to the charge trapping layer and vice-versa. Therefore, it is imperative to find novel structures and materials to be incorporated in the memory cells which would allow <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxide</b> and voltage scaling.|$|E

40|$|Tunnel oxides” is {{a rather}} generic term which {{historically}} refers {{to a number of}} minerals which, from a chemical point of view, are (mainly) manganese oxides. In nature manganese occurs in three different oxidation states - Mn 2 +, Mn 3 + and Mn 4 + - with the latter being the dominant form in <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxides.</b> Tetravalent manganese typically has octahedral coordination, and using only [Mn 4 +O 6] building modules linked together via corner- and edge-sharing, it is feasible to construct many framework structures. A smaller set of titanate minerals display the same feature, as might be expected due to the similar crystal-chemical behaviour of manganese and titanium. Starting from the basic formula of manganese dioxide, Mn 4 +O 2, incorporation of mono- and divalent cations (primarily alkali and alkali earths) within the tunnels of the structures, can be accommodated by partial reduction of manganese to Mn 3 +, or through substitution of tetravalent Mn (and Ti) by other trivalent cations with typically display octahedral coordination. The substitutions can be summarized in the generic formulae: A+x (M 3 +x M 4 + 1 -x) O 2 or A 2 +x (M 3 + 2 x M 4 + 1 - 2 x) O 2 where A = Na+, K+, Rb+, Mg 2 +, Ba 2 +, Pb 2 +; M 3 + = Mn, Fe, V, Cr, Al; and M 4 + = Mn or Ti. Water molecules can also enter the tunnels. In all these compounds Mn 4 +O 6 or Ti 4 +O 6 octahedra are arranged in edge-sharing columns, which in turn link together, again by edge-sharing, to construct ribbons, with widths ranging from 1 to . Cross-linking by corner-sharing of columns or ribbons in near perpendicular directions, gives rise to a number of different tunnel structures that may be square or rectangular, depending on the dimensions of the ribbons. The ideal topological symmetry of the frameworks is either tetragonal (for structures with the same dimensionality in the two directions, e. g., 1 x 1, 2 x 2, …) or orthorhombic. In most cases the real symmetry is lower, where the deviation arises from minor distortions of the framework and/or ordered distributions of cations. The unit cell axis along the direction in which the octahedral columns or ribbons run is 2. 8 - 2. 9 Å, corresponding to a single octahedron repeat, whereas the two unit cell parameters in the orthogonal plane depend on the width of the ribbons. Among <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxides,</b> several mineral and synthetic compounds are known which display a wide range of structure topologies. For their use in several important applications (e. g., heavy metals sorption in contaminated waters or soils, or immobilisation of radioactive cesium), emphasis has been given to the dimensions of the tunnels, for which these compounds can act as selective molecular sieves. A selection, sorted by dimensions of the tunnels, includes. 1 x 1 tunnels: pyrolusite, rutile, cassiterite, plattnerite, argutite, manganite, stishovite. 1 x 2 tunnels: ramsdellite, groutite, goethite, diaspore. 1 x 3 tunnels: nsutite (with 1 x 3 tunnels occurring at the unit cell scale). 2 x 2 tunnels: hollandite, cryptomelane, coronadite, priderite, redledgeite, strontiomelane, henrymeyerite, mannardite, ankangite, manjiroite, and a lot of synthetic compounds, including among others the high pressure form of feldspar (KAlSi 3 O 8) with octahedrally coordinated Si 4 +. 2 x 3 tunnels: romanechite. 2 x 4 tunnels: synthetic Rb 0. 25 (Mn 4 +,Mn 3 +) O 2, synthetic Na 0. 33 (Mn 4 +,Mn 3 +) O 2 •xH 2 O. 2 x 5 tunnels: synthetic Rb 0. 27 (Mn 4 +,Mn 3 +) O 2. 3 x 3 tunnels: todorokite. 3 x 4 tunnels: woodruffite. <b>Tunnel</b> <b>oxides</b> show a high degree of structural flexibility: the substitution of VIM 4 + cations with trivalent cations is often coupled with octahedral distortion: such a distortion is more pronounced when the substituting cation is Mn 3 +, which is known to display Jahn-Teller effect, and is also related to the local bond valence balance. From the crystallographic point of view, these structures can be described as the members of a polysomatic family built up by two sets of nearly perpendicular ribbons. In general, each member of the family will be described by a symbol of the kind “M x N”, with both M and N potentially ranging between 1 and , being M  N. This is purely formal, since of course the structures, e. g., 2 x 3 and 3 x 2 are topologically identical between each other, and should not be considered twice (cf. Fig. 1). The capability of <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxides</b> to incorporate larger cations within the tunnels is limited to those polysomes with M  2. Polysomes with N =  are those structures in which ribbons degenerate into infinite octahedral layers and therefore do not belong, strictly speaking, to the family of <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxides,</b> although some of the typical features of microporous material (e. g., cation exchange capabilities) have been described for these layered polysomes as well. The 1 x  (lithiophorite), 2 x  (birnessite), and 3 x  (‘buserite’) polysomes are known to occur so far. The correspondence between polysomatic symbol and the tunnel structures is fairly good, with one exception only. Ramsdellite has been considered as the 1 x 2 tunnel structure and included together with the other <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxides,</b> but in strict polysomatic terms this is incorrect. In fact the common feature of all <b>tunnel</b> <b>oxides</b> berlonging to the polysomatic family is the occurrence of two sets of ribbons formed by edge-sharing octahedral chains with dimensions ranging from 1 to  that develop in orthogonal directions. This is not the case for ramsdellite, where the ribbons (with width corresponding to two octahedral chains) are parallel (cf. Fig. 2). Confusingly, in ramsdellite the notation “ 1 x 2 ” refers to the opening of the tunnels, but not to the width of the ribbons. Consequently 1 x 1 tunnels found in all other members of the polysomatic family – but those with N =  – do not occur in ramsdellite. The notation “ 1 x 2 ”, when referred to the polysomatic description and not to the tunnels, denotes a different structure, which has not been yet reported for any mineral or synthetic compound, but only recognized as local domains within nsutite...|$|R

New phenomena are pointed out, as negative differential resistance and the appearing of threshold voltages below which a rapid decrease of the conduction current is observed. According to our model, these behaviors can be well-simulated considering discrete defects energy levels in the SiO 2 bandgap. Threshold voltages measured around 2 to 3 V appear to be very close to retention conditions floating gate potentials in EEPROM cells. According to a simple model, EEPROM retention times are extrapolated and it is shown that the particular behavior of SILC currents could explain the fact that retention times remain in the product specifications even for hardly cycled cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{low-cost}} process of embedding metal nanocrystals as charge storage centers within a dielectric is demonstrated to address leakage {{issues associated with}} the scaling of the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>oxide</b> in flash memories. Metal nanocrystals with high work functions (nickel, platinum and palladium) were prepared as embedded species in methyl siloxane spin-on-glass (SOG) films on silicon substrates. Sub- 10 nm-sized, well-isolated, uniformly distributed, multi-layered nanocrystals with high particle densities (10 11 - 10 12 cm - 2) were formed in the films by thermal curing of the spin-coated SOG films containing the metal precursors. Capacitance-Voltage measurements performed on metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors with the SOG films show {{that the presence of}} metal nanocrystals enhanced the memory window of the films to 2. 32 V at low operating voltages of ± 5 V. These SOG films demonstrated the ability to store both holes and electrons. Capacitance-time measurements show good charge retention of more than 75 % after 10 4 s of discharging. This work demonstrates the applicability of the low-cost in-situ sol-gel preparation in contrast to conventional methods that involve multiple and expensive processing steps...|$|R
