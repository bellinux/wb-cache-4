5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} India, they moult their feathers from June to October. The wing moult {{begins in}} July {{with the first}} primary and proceeds towards the tenth. Secondaries are replaced from August after <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> are at the third quill. The secondary moult is not orderly, the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier than the rest. The tail feathers are moulted centrifugally. Seasonal colour changes in the testicular tissues are caused by variation in melanin synthesis, with the dark pigmentation being lost during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{fought it}} out with McCarthy in <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> as Humphrey used {{favorite}} son stand-ins to help him win delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Kennedy was assassinated, leaving Humphrey as McCarthy's main challenger. But Humphrey's organization was too strong for McCarthy to overcome, and his anti-war campaign was split after the late entrance of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota {{just ahead of the}} Democratic National Convention. Despite winning the popular vote, McCarthy lost to Humphrey at the convention amidst protests and riots.|$|E

5|$|Reporters deemed Harding {{unlikely}} to be nominated due to his poor showing in <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> and relegated him to a place among the dark horses. Harding, who like the other candidates was in Chicago supervising his campaign, had finished sixth in the final public opinion poll, behind the three main candidates as well as former justice Hughes and Herbert Hoover, and only slightly ahead of Coolidge.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Sanford began {{preparations}} {{two years}} later for {{a run for the}} 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Announcing his candidacy on June 1, 1975, he juggled campaign appearances with his obligations as president of Duke. While he developed a following among educators, {{he did not have a}} satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a heart murmur. On January 25, Sanford withdrew from <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> the first Democrat to do so that year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> season, Clinton only very {{narrowly}} won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E

5|$|Nixon won the Republican {{primary and}} Douglas the Democratic contest, with each also {{finishing}} {{third in the}} other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, and Democrats were slow to rally to Douglas—some even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio {{to the detriment of}} national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58counties and all metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, 2008, Paul finally {{withdrew his}} bid for the Republican nomination. He later {{said that one of}} the reasons he did not run in the general {{election}} as a third-party candidate, after losing <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> was that, as a concession to gain ballot access in certain states, he had signed legally binding agreements to not run a third-party campaign if he lost the primary. Some of the $4 million remaining campaign contributions was invested into the new political action and advocacy group called Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. <b>The</b> <b>primaries,</b> secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. <b>The</b> <b>primaries</b> and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces glare from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|E
5|$|The Danish foreign {{ministry}} reviewed the 348documents that the BBC obtained in 2001 under the Freedom of Information Act. In January 2009, foreign minister Per Stig Møller commissioned {{a study by}} the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) to compare the 348 documents with 317 documents released by the Department of Energy in 1994 in order to determine if the 348 documents contained any new information about an intact nuclear weapon at Thule. In August 2009, DIIS published its report, which contradicted the assertions of the BBC. The report concluded that there was no missing bomb, and that the American underwater operation was a search for the uranium-235 of the fissile core of a secondary. For the first time, the report was able to present an estimate of the amount of plutonium contained in the pits of <b>the</b> <b>primaries.</b>|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} among the subspecies. For T. l. ludovicianus, the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its rump and uppertail-coverts. Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown, {{with a series of}} small white dots on the lesser primary coverts. The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its iris is reddish-brown, the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and lower mandible. The legs are flesh-colored.|$|E
5|$|The Pact of Olivos {{diminished the}} electoral {{strength}} of the UCR, leading {{to the rise of}} the Frepaso. Both parties united in a political coalition, the Alliance, which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections. It was the PJ's first national defeat since 1985. The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections. De la Rúa stood for the UCR; the whole party, including Alfonsín, supported him. The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide, who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province. De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin. In <b>the</b> <b>primaries,</b> De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995. Despite his victory, Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR. They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa's ticket; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him. Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez, leader of the Frepaso, saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise. It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance: except for Meijide, the Frepaso did not have a political figure who may run with good chances for governor of the Buenos Aires province. Had she run for vicepresident, Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate.|$|E
