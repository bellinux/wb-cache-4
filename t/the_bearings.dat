5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> {{chamber of}} an {{aeroengine}} houses roller bearings and other structural parts. The spatial limitation, high operational speeds of the HP shaft and the {{proximity to the}} combustion chamber can make the operating conditions of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber challenging. A roller bearing consists of an inner race, an outer race and a cage constraining a number of rolling elements. In the aeroengine application, oil is introduced into <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber via <b>the</b> inner race regions of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> into <b>the</b> rolling elements interstices. This provides lubrication for <b>the</b> roller <b>bearings.</b> <b>The</b> source of heat in <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber is mainly from rolling contact friction and the high temperature of combustion. Cooling results from the oil transport within <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber and thus an efficient transport of oil is critical to maintaining {{the integrity of the}} entire structure. <b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber contains <b>the</b> oil which is eventually scavenged and recycled for recirculation. Experiments have been conducted over <b>the</b> years on <b>bearing</b> chamber flows but often simplified to create the best emulation of the real aeroengine. The complexity of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber structure is also challenging for experimental measurements of the oil characteristic in <b>the</b> roller <b>bearing</b> elements and <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber compartment. Previous experiments have shown that the oil continuum breaks up in <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber compartment but it is not quantitatively clear how and what parameters affect these.

5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway.

It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of different colors (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned by a massive dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from Dagestan. In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E

5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service.

40|$|A {{rejected}} {{nose wheel}} hub with loose race at <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> housing area {{was sent to}} this laboratory for investigation.

25|$|Rust {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of bridge accidents. As rust has a much higher volume than the {{originating}} mass of iron, its build-up can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts. It was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus river bridge in 1983, when <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support. Three drivers on the roadway at the time died as the slab fell into the river below. The following NTSB investigation showed that a drain in the road had been blocked for road re-surfacing, and had not been unblocked; as a result, runoff water penetrated the support hangers. Rust was also an important factor in the Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia, when a steel suspension bridge collapsed within a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the oil level became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the oil level to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper oil level was not maintained, <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|E

Gravity yards were a historical step in the development of classification yards and were later judged as inferior to hump yards, because it became clear that shunting engines were needed anyway (at least in inclement weather like strong winds or icy temperatures when the oil in <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> became thick), and because manual labour was getting relatively more and more expensive.
