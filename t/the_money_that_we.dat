60|$|I do {{not think}} the issue before the country was ever more simple than it is now. The money must be found; there is no dispute about that. Both parties are {{responsible}} for the expenditure and the obligations which render new revenue necessary; and, as we know, we have difficulty in resisting demands which are made upon us by the Conservative Party for expenditure upon armaments far beyond the limits which are necessary to maintain adequately the defences of the country, and which would only be the accompaniment of a sensational and aggressive policy in foreign and in Colonial affairs. We declare that the proposals we have put forward are conceived with a desire to be fair to all and harsh to none.

We know that the proposals which we have made will yield all <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need for national defence, and that they will yield an expanding revenue in future years for those great schemes of social organisation, of national insurance, of agricultural development, and of the treatment of the problems of poverty and unemployment, which are absolutely necessary if Great Britain is to hold her own in the front rank of the nations.

This thesis analyzes data from 62 Antideficiency Act formal investigations for the period 1987 to 1997.

40|$|Some of {{the things}} that you must know in bird control are your state and local regulations. The state law may read that a license is {{required}} for bird control. A state law may read that the techniques and manners of your control must conform with their law. A state law may require registration of the poison you 2 ̆ 7 re going to use. State law may also prohibit placement of baits at a certain time during the day or year. And most important, a state law may prohibit control of specific types of birds. In Nebraska and most of the other states, the English Sparrow, the Pigeon, and the Starling are our # 1 birds on the most-wanted list.

I want to know the water sources if possible, and I want to know the roosting, nesting, dusting, and molting sites.

40|$|There {{has been}} a long {{standing}} debate regarding how firms can alleviate the agency problem and align the interests of the agent with those of the principal. In this study, <b>we</b> theorize <b>that</b> if firms can incentivize executives to act more like owners as opposed to agents, it will lead to better performance of the firm. <b>We</b> hypothesize <b>that</b> there are two approaches how this may be achieved. The first is when the executive has a substantial shareholding in the firm. The second is when the firm employs a long-term incentive program, which is based on equity or the market value of equity. In regard to the first approach, we have found it necessary to put the value of the executives’ shareholding in relation to an “anchor” in an effort to account for different individuals’ perceptions of <b>the</b> value of <b>money.</b> <b>The</b> anchor <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have used is the executives’ annual salary. Subsequently, we have designed a new variable which we call the CEO level of engagement, constituted by the value of the executives’ shareholding divided by the executives’ annual salary. The purpose of this thesis is thus to investigate whether or not we can identify a relationship between the CEO level of engagement and the use of equity based long-term incentive programs with the stock market performance of firms as well as with key financial performance indicators, such as return on equity, return on capital employed, change in revenue and change in the number of employees. To achieve this, we have employed a quantitative research approach based on secondary data mainly from annual reports and stock market data. We have investigated the performance of 56 firms on Stockholm Large Cap OMX over the period 2011 – 2016 and analyzed the data with descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Our findings suggest that there is a relationship between the CEO level of engagement and stock market performance, and that the relationship is statistically significant. However, our findings only provide partial support for a relationship between the CEO level of engagement and certain financial performance indicators, specifically the change in number of employees from one year to the next. Furthermore, our study does not adequately support the theory that there is a relationship between the use of equity based long-term incentive programs with either stock market performance or key financial performance indicators.

However, according to Iain Cook, the group had [...] "kind of ... took Alucard over" [...] when recording of the first LP ended, {{despite the fact that they}} were still renting the place at the time, and decided to stay in the studio to produce Every Open Eye: [...] "we wanted to go right back to where it all started. Partly, I guess, superstitiously. There’s something in the room that we didn’t want to lose, and we’d rather invest <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had available into upgrading the gear and patching it all in — just making it exactly the way we wanted it, rather than giving it to some other studio and another producer in LA or wherever.” Doherty said that the low rent price of the place gave the members less worry about risking waste of production costs, therefore allowing more freedom for experimentation that he felt was needed in making electronic music. The Neumann KH120A monitors that were used in this room were also used for the recording of the Bones album, which they praised as [...] "kind of easy to get along with, but at the same time quite representative of what’s going on".|$|E
