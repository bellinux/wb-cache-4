40|$|Preventing {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} (OH&S) hazards through design is consistent with the principle that OH&S is most effectively managed through the elimination of hazards at their &# 039;source&# 039; rather than reducing risks once hazards have eventuated in the workplace. There is growing recognition that decisions made during the design of a building or structure can significantly impact of OH&S during the construction stage. This has prompted the incorporation of specfic duties for designers of buildings and structures in the principal OH&S Acts of some Australian states (eg.

30|$|The air {{injection}} connector system {{is also known}} as parasitic pipe joints. In the past, underbalanced drilling was usually realized by the principle of the “U-tube”, which means another injection well must be made first to form a “U-tube” with the production well to inject high-pressure air when the production well is being drilled. In order to reduce the budget of drilling and <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>hazards</b> with few engineering work, the injection well was replaced by the {{air injection}} connector system, which is connected on the production casing at a predetermined position down {{into the bottom of the}} well with the casing. It will then open a valve to inject air into the casing ring space during drilling to realize underbalanced drilling (Xian et al. 2009). In order to meet the technical requirements of the above process, the air injection connector system must consist of a non-return valve to eliminate backflow. It must be sent downhole together with the casing and be cemented disposable with the casing. After completion of the first phase of drilling process, the air injection connector could be used to inject high-pressure air in the next phase of drilling process. The pressurized air mixed with the drilling mud would help to increase the performance of underbalanced drilling (Fried et al. 1996; Bennion et al. 1998; Misselbrook et al. 1991; Oyatomari et al. 2002).|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary What is {{good for}} the {{environment}} is not automatically safer for workers, but {{it should be possible to}} make choices to that are both “greener” and “safer”. This guide aims to help you to be “greener and safer” by planning ahead – prevention through design by making good choices of materials. Sometimes choices are interconnected and may have multiple benefits. USCDC/NIOSH has piloted a program, in collaboration with OSHA, AIHA, and many others, called “prevention through design” (PtD). The concept of PtD can be defined as: Addressing occupational safety and health needs in the design process to prevent or minimize the work-related hazards and risks associated with the construction, manufacture, use, maintenance, and disposal of facilities, materials, and equipment. Eliminating hazards through planning, organization, and engineering as we take our knowledge about old and new hazards and examine the challenges created by new technologies and adaptations of work activities to perform green jobs.

The Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC (MD) - transposed into the respective national legislations -is the European regulatory framework for the design and construction of new machinery, as the future PPLs.

In this regulatory context, the project PLATFORM is aligning the design of the PPLs according to the MD requirements, in order to facilitate the CE marking in 2020 (TRL 9) and avoid potential economic costs associated with future re-adaptations or modifications needed to ensure compliance with the MD. This paper discusses the methodological approach followed by the project PLATFORM to integrate all the nanosafety aspects in the design of the PPLs, in order to achieve safe designs in conformity with the relevant Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) of the MD.

Ce programme, dispensé par une centrale syndicale québécoise à ses membres, a pour objectif ultime d’améliorer l’action syndicale des travailleurs à ce sujet dans leur milieu de travail. Nos résultats semblent indiquer que ce programme produit la majorité des effets attendus relatifs aux thèmes étudiés, soit d’accroître la compréhension du rôle des facteurs environnementaux sur l’occurrence d’accidents de travail et d’attribuer ces événements à des risques environnementaux dont les employeurs sont responsables. The {{overall objective}} of the evaluative research project reported here {{was to determine the}} extent to which a health and safety training program offered by a Quebec labour federation produced expected outcomes or equivalently achieved its objectives. The ultimate {{objective of the}} fifteen-hour training program, delivered over three days, was to improve the health and safety interventions of the federation’s members. This report discusses the results concerning occupational accidents, one of the themes of the training program. The study population was composed of members of the federation’s unions who were eligible for the training program. A pre-test/post-test study design with a non-equivalent control group was used, and subjects were recruited using a clustered sampling strategy. The exposed group was composed of 65 union representatives who participated in one of four three-day health and safety training programs between February and November 1999. The control group was composed of 60 union representatives who had participated in three-day training programs on noise, work organization (2 groups) or the role of union representatives (3 groups) between November 1997 and February 2000. In all cases, the pre-test was administered at the beginning of the first day of the training program and the post-test administered at the end of the last day. The objectives of the accident module of the health and safety training program were to improve participants’ understanding of the multiple causes of occupational accidents, improve their ability to identify these causes and accident-prevention measures, and enable trainees to attribute occupational accidents to environmental hazards for which employers are legally responsible. Data was collected from subjects using a self-administered questionnaire that included questions related to the expected outcomes of the training program. The questionnaire also provided data on the subjects and this was used to control for selection biases that could compromise the internal validity of the study. The dependent and control variables were subjected to descriptive analyses, and the groups were compared using bivariate analyses. The effect of exposure to the training program on each of the six expected outcomes of the program was estimated using multivariate analysis. The independent variable in these analyses was exposure to the training program, measured as a dichotomous variable (exposed/control), while the six dependent variables were the subjects’ post-test scores for each of the expected program outcomes. In order to estimate the net training effect, i. e. the difference between post-test and pre-test knowledge and skills, the pre-test results were used as control variables for each of the six program outcomes. In addition, the three variables related to health and safety competence, acquired before program exposure, were also used as control variables, in order to control for biases due to interaction between selection and test habituation. The response rates for the exposed and control groups were 65 % and 70 %, yielding exposed and control groups of 42 subjects each. The only variable exhibiting a statistically significant association with the attribution of accidents to worker-related causes during the post-test was exposure to the training program. In fact, participation in the training program reduced the probability of such attribution by 85. 9 % (odds ratio : 0. 141). Both pre-test results and participation in the training program affect the probability that subjects attribute accidents to environmental causes. After controlling for pre-test results, this probability was four times greater in the group taking the program than in the control group. The training program therefore appears to have attained one of its objectives, namely to increase participants’ understanding of the role that environmental factors play in occupational accidents. No association was observed between any variables and the identification of individual measures that would prevent accidents during the post-test. However, a statistically significant association was observed between the identification of organizational measures that would prevent accidents and both pre-test scores and participation in the training program. After controlling for pre-test results, subjectshaving participated in the training program were fourteen times more likely to identify organizational measures. A statistically significant association was observed between three variables and the percentage of responsibility attributed to employers for accidents. These three variables account for 30. 4 % of the total variation in the percentage of responsibility attributed to employers. Participation in the training program is the variable that appears to exert the greatest effect, followed by pre-test scores and exposure to other occupational health and safety training. Furthermore, a statistically significant association was observed between two variables and the percentage of responsibility attributed to workers for accidents. These two variables account for 17. 8 % of the total variation in the percentage of responsibility attributed to workers. Responsibility of workers was negatively associated with participation in the training program and positively associated with pre-test scores. These results appear to indicate that the union representatives who participate in the training program are more likely to attribute accidents to external causes. The content of the health and safety training program is meant to be directly relevant to union activities recommended by the labour federation. Rather than technically proficient health and safety specialists, the program aims at producing individuals who can mobilize workers to establish a balance of power with their employers. This then allows them to participate in activities designed <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>hazards</b> at their source. To achieve this, union federation officers believe it essential to modify the attribution of occupational accidents by their members, since internal attribution is likely to result in a scapegoating of accident victims, which in turn hinders the implementation of prevention measures designed to eliminate occupational accidents at their source. These results indicate that the accident module of the training program achieves most of its expected outcomes, and no program modification is therefore recommended. The study allowed the development of a measurement technique that the labour federation can use to evaluate the expected outcomes of its program and to identify union members who would benefit from the program.
