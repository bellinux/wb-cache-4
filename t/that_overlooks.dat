25|$|Dieppe, {{a coastal}} {{town in the}} Seine-Inférieure {{department}} of France, is built along a long cliff <b>that</b> <b>overlooks</b> the English Channel.

In 1942, the Germans had demolished some seafront buildings to aid in coastal defence and had set up two large artillery batteries at Berneval-le-Grand and Varengeville-sur-Mer. One important consideration for the planners was that Dieppe was within range of the Royal Air Force's fighter aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, the {{trustees}} acquired Mountaintop Farm (also {{known locally as}} Patterson's or Brown's Mountain), the only property <b>that</b> <b>overlooks</b> Monticello.

Jefferson had owned {{it as part of}} his plantation, but it was sold off after his death. In the 20th-century, its farmhouses were divided into apartments for many University of Virginia students. The officials at Monticello had long considered the property an eyesore, and planned to acquire it when it became available.|$|E
25|$|MtGeochil (Geochilsan-guk) is {{recorded}} as a chiefdom of the Jinhan Confederacy in the 2nd–4th centuries. It was absorbed by Silla and organized as a district (gun). The grave goods excavated from mounded burials at Bokcheon-dong {{indicate that a}} complex chiefdom ruled by powerful individuals was present in the Busan area in the 4th century, just as Korea's Three Kingdoms were forming. The mounded burials of Bokcheon-dong were built {{along the top of}} a ridge <b>that</b> <b>overlooks</b> a wide area that makes up parts of modern-day Dongnae-gu and Yeonje-gu.

25|$|The building’s {{interior}} is distributed across three floors: a basement floor, {{which includes the}} kitchen, pantry and service areas; a ground floor including all the living rooms, dining rooms, atriums and library; and a first-floor which corresponds to the private quarters. Visitors entering the Villa through the main entrance from the street, that is relatively dark, will gain their first impression of the building’s structure and {{its relationship with the}} garden, from the impressive two-storey central hall. Looking in front, through the vast exterior window, they will see the central parterre and park. Looking to the right, they will see the vast salon which extends via the window to the lateral parterre. The Villa’s private quarters can be sensed rather than seen, via the first floor gallery around the central atrium. To the left, with a slight difference of floor levels, there is an elegant dining room <b>that</b> <b>overlooks</b> the garden and a billiards room, on the other side, that looks over the street. Beyond them we see a wrought iron gate designed by Edgar Brandt, which separates this social zone from the Villa’s private quarters on the first floor and also the library and service areas on the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|Saturn was the {{successor}} of the Punic Ba'al Hammon {{and was the}} attendant (paredros) of Tanit or Juno Caelestis. During the Roman era, the city of Dougga had at least two sanctuaries dedicated to Saturn. The evidence {{for the existence of}} one of the two derives mostly from inscriptions found in the city. The second temple, which is the one commonly known as the Temple of Saturn at Dougga, has been excavated. The remains of this temple, which are less significant than those of the capitol or the Temple of Juno Caelestis, are of particular interest because of their location. The ruins lie atop a promontory <b>that</b> <b>overlooks</b> the rich cereal valley of the Oued Khalled, 160 metres from the theatre and outside the bounds of the city. During the excavation works, remains of a temple of Ba'al Hammon, particularly favissae (ritual ditches) containing ex-votos, were discovered. The Roman temple thus replaced an indigenous sanctuary that dated back at least to the 2nd century BCE. This sanctuary consisted essentially of a wide open space designed to receive ex-votos and sacrifices. It was covered over to facilitate the construction of the Temple of Saturn, the ruins of which can still be seen today.|$|E
25|$|The town's natural {{landmark}} is Western Beacon; a hill <b>that</b> <b>overlooks</b> the town. People walk {{up there}} for the views of Ivybridge and the South Hams. The town's first manmade landmark is the Ivy Bridge; a 13th-century hump-backed bridge covered in Ivy. It is still in use today and gives {{the name of the}} town – Ivybridge. The two remaining industrial landmarks of the town are the viaduct over the River Erme and the paper mill. The original viaduct was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1848, only the granite piers remain. The operational line alongside was built by Sir James Charles Inglis opened in 1894 for the Great Western Railway. It still carries the mainline trains. They were key to the town's initial growth in the Industrial Revolution and are still importance to the town today. In the centre of the town a war memorial, equidistant from three of the churches, was unveiled in 1922 and each year on Remembrance Day the town holds a ceremony to those who lost their lives. In recent years another memorial has also been built nearby commemorating the lives of American servicemen stationed in and near the town in 1943-1944, many of whom died on Omaha Beach on D-Day. The Watermark is one of the town's modern landmarks, which began construction in 2007 and was completed in March 2008 at a cost of £1.4 million. It functions as a library, entertainment venue, cinema and offers office space.|$|E
