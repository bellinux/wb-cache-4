40|$|We {{find the}} first {{binary black hole}} event horizon with a <b>toroidal</b> <b>topology.</b> It had been {{predicted}} that generically the event horizons of merging black holes should briefly have a <b>toroidal</b> <b>topology,</b> but such a phase has never been seen prior to this work. In all previous binary black hole simulations, in the coordinate slicing used to evolve the black holes, the topology of the event horizon transitions directly from two spheres during the inspiral to a single sphere as the black holes merge. We present a coordinate transformation to a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces that "cut a hole" through the event horizon surface, resulting in a toroidal event horizon. A torus could potentially provide a mechanism for violating topological censorship. However, these toroidal event horizons satisfy topological censorship by construction, because we can always trivially apply the inverse coordinate transformation to remove the topological feature.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} spatial topology in 3 + 1 dimensional causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) by performing numerical simulations with <b>toroidal</b> spatial <b>topology</b> instead of the previously used spherical topology. In the case of spherical spatial topology we observed in the so-called phase C an average spatial volume distribution n(t) which after a suitable time redefinition could be identified as the spatial volume distribution of the four-sphere. Imposing <b>toroidal</b> spatial <b>topology</b> {{we find that the}} average spatial volume distribution n(t) is constant. By measuring the covariance matrix of spatial volume fluctuations we determine the form of the effective action. The difference compared to the spherical case is that the effective potential has changed such that it allows a constant average n(t). This is what we observe and this is what one would expect from a minisuperspace GR action where only the scale factor is kept as dynamical variable. Although no background geometry is put in by hand, the full quantum theory of CDT is also with toroidal spatial toplogy able to identify a classical background geometry around which there are well defined quantum fluctuations.

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} 2 The standard Grad-Shafranov equation for axisymmetric toroidal plasma equilibrium is customary {{expressed in}} cylindrical coordinates with toroidal contours, and through which benchmark equilibria are solved. An alternative approach {{to cast the}} Grad-Shafranov equation in spherical coordinates is presented. This equation, in spherical coordinates, is examined for toroidal solutions to describe low β Solovev and high β plasma equilibria in terms of elementary functions. Subject headings: Toroidal Equilibria 3 I. Grad-Shafranov Equation The Grad-Shafranov equation (1, 2) for toroidal plasma equilibria is traditionally formulated in a toroidal system using cylindrical coordinates to suit the plasma topology. This equation describes the poloidal magnetic flux, in cylindrical coordinates, with source terms that are themselves flux gradients. By specifying the source functionals in magnetic flux, toroidal equilibria are solved by different methods. Because of the cylindrical representation of a <b>toroidal</b> <b>topology,</b> the solutions {{are not easy to}} visualize and the mathematical analytic tools are rather limilted, which weaken the communication between theorists and experimentalists. Here, we propose to solve axisymmetric plasma equilibria in standard spherical coordiantes by looking for solutions with <b>toroidal</b> <b>topology.</b> With the familiar spherical system, and the large volume of well-known special functions in this coordinate system, the solutions in <b>toroidal</b> <b>topology</b> appear in a much friendly presentation, which improves physical interpretations. We first derive the Grad-Shafranov equation in spherical coordinates by considering ⃗J × ⃗ B − ∇p = 0, (1) ∇ × ⃗ B = µ ⃗ J.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of one-forms on meshes. The theory culminates in a {{discrete}} analog of the Poincare-Hopf index theorem for meshes.

We characterize when {{it is still possible}} to achieve an injective parameterization, despite these boundaries being non-convex. The third result is an analogous Tutte-like theorem for meshes with genus 1 (topologically equivalent to the torus), paving the way for a general method to locally parameterize such meshes to the plane in a naturally seamless manner.

40|$|We use {{methods of}} {{quantum field theory}} in <b>toroidal</b> <b>topologies</b> to study the N-component D-dimensional massive Gross-Neveu model, at zero and finite temperature, with compactified spatial coordinates. We discuss the {{behavior}} of the large-N coupling constant (g), investigating its dependence on the compactification length (L) and the temperature (T). For all values of the fixed coupling constant (λ), we find an asymptotic-freedom type of behavior, with g→ 0 as L→ 0 and/or T→∞. At T= 0, and for λ≥λ_c^(D) (the strong coupling regime), we show that, starting in the region of asymptotic freedom and increasing L, a divergence of g appears at a finite value of L, signaling the existence of a phase transition with the system getting spatially confined. Such a spatial confinement is destroyed by raising the temperature. The confining length, L_c^(D), and the deconfining temperature, T_d^(D), are determined as functions of λ and the mass (m) of the fermions, in the case of D= 2, 3, 4. Taking m as the constituent quark mass (≈ 350 MeV), the results obtained are of the same order of magnitude as the diameter (≈ 1. 7 fm) and the estimated deconfining temperature (≈ 200 MeV) of hadrons.
