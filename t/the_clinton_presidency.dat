He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

500|$|During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with {{a number}} of {{industry}} groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies.

[...] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator {{in the history of the}} agency, staying through both terms of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>presidency</b> – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years. [...] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as [...] "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," [...] and wrote that she was [...] "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues." [...] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.|$|E

[...] President Bill Clinton also was criticized for not acting timely to re-appoint Tax Court judges, having allowed one sitting Chief Judge's term to expire, thus requiring the Tax Court to elect a new Chief Judge.
