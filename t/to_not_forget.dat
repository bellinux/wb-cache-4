500|$|The five deities are {{addressed}} by chanting the five letters or syllables (Bijamantra {{which are the}} sounds of the Chakras) which are laṃ (...) , vaṃ (...) , raṃ (...) , yaṃ (...) , and haṃ (...) to become one with Parameshvara (God). Verses 8.11–15 state that a yogin should practice meditating on these respective body systems as deities, with the help of Om mantra, as this leads to dissolution, and realization of the Brahman-Purusha. After mastery is achieved with the aid of envisioning the five deities within one's body, the text mentions that the yogin overcomes three Dosha (दोष, faults). The chapter ends by reminding the yoga student <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the daily duties and works, the virtuous self-restraints (yamas) and virtuous observances (niyamas) as he gains mastery to this level of yoga.|$|E

500|$|Rumble's hip hop group, Fast Crew, {{released}} {{their second}} studio album, Truth, Lies & Red Tape, in 2008. The band split soon afterwards, and Rumble {{decided to pursue}} a solo musical career, and taught himself to play the guitar. He began writing material for his album, but he found that {{he could no longer}} write hip hop. [...] "Hip hop was just wearing really thin for me because it's really quite macho. 'I'm wicked because of this. I'm the best because of that'. It's a lot of talking yourself up," [...] Rumble said. He began to write songs inspired by his own experiences and emotions, which allowed him to explore other musical genres. He explained that when he wrote songs for the album, he began by creating a chord progression using his guitar, which evolved into the tune's basic melody, after which he would determine its theme. Other songs were conceived by Rumble humming a tune during everyday activities, then recording it onto his iPhone so as <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> it. The tune would later be refined to a full-fledged song. According to Rumble, writing music was the hardest component of the album's making. [...] "Always Be Here" [...] was the first song Rumble completed, which he sent to record label Warner Music NZ, thereby commencing his solo career.|$|E

Even the king's reserve melted a little, though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at first. I had asked him to try <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that he was a farmer; but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that, and not elaborate it any. Because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you didn't warn him, his tongue was so handy, and his spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{to improve}} memory through passive review, an {{individual}} may read a text today; <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> it, it is repeated tomorrow and then 4 {{days later and}} then 8, 16, 32, 64, etc., days later.

Passive review is a simple method but it is not as effective. Active recall is more complicated and difficult (because it forces one to recall something) but it is highly effective.|$|E
