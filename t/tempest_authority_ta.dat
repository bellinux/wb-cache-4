Our solution to the problem adapts the Boneh-Franklin identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme. It allows any entity to securely communicate with any other entity, even without knowing the TA with which the intended recipient is associated. To enable this, we assume that the TAs co-operate to distribute certain additional public information to all entities which allows entities to decrypt a ciphertext that was composed using the public parameters of one TA, using a private key issued by another.
