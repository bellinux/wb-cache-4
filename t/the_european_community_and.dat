5|$|The {{parliament}} of Croatia declared Croatia's {{independence and}} dissolved {{its association with}} Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991.

5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> <b>and</b> the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|The European Council officially {{gained the}} status of an EU {{institution}} after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, distinct from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits {{of the leaders of}} <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community,</b> <b>and</b> were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the European Commission) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the European Political Cooperation) taking integration beyond economics.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> <b>and</b> other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E

25|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{campaign is}} a labor tactic primarily {{used in the}} United States, where labor unions lack many of the legal protections accorded their counterparts in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> <b>and</b> where cultural norms against unions are not as strong.

25|$|In the 1984 {{election}} the Greens participated again.

They also issued a Joint Declaration of the European Green Parties. Furthermore, overall the member parties had grown stronger. Eleven MEPs of member parties were elected to the European Parliament. They formed the Green Alternative European Link (GRAEL) in the European Parliament. The group was too small to be recognised by the Parliament for funds and committees and therefore it joined the Rainbow Group, which also encompassed regionalists, the Danish People's Movement against <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> <b>and</b> some radicals and socialists.|$|E
25|$|Labour Party historians see {{his years}} in office as lost {{opportunities}} for major reforms. However, {{in keeping with the}} mood of the 1960s his government sponsored liberal changes in a number of social areas; they were generally not his initiatives. These included the liberalisation of laws on censorship, divorce, homosexuality, immigration, and abortion; as well as the abolition of capital punishment, which was {{due in part to the}} initiatives of backbench MPs who had the support of Roy Jenkins during his time as Home Secretary. Overall, Wilson is seen to have managed a number of difficult political issues with considerable tactical skill, including such potentially divisive issues for his party as the role of public ownership, British membership of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community,</b> <b>and</b> the Vietnam War, while continuing to maintain a costly military presence East of Suez. His stated ambition of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance remained largely unfulfilled. He lost his energy and drive in his second government, and accomplished little as the leadership split over Europe and trade union issues began tearing Labour apart.|$|E
