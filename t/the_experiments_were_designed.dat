50|$|The Air-defense {{experiments}} were {{a series of}} management science experiments performed between 1952 and 1954 by RAND Corporation's Systems Research Laboratory. <b>The</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> {{to provide information about}} organizational learning and how teams improved their performance through practice.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{carried a}} 600 kg payload, including 385 kg of experiments; consisting of 39 experiments in fluid physics, biology, material science, meteoritics, radiation dosimetry and exobiology (BIOPAN-5). Some of <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> by the ESA's student programme.|$|E
50|$|The {{experiments}} {{began in}} 1945, when Manhattan Project scientists {{were preparing to}} detonate the first atomic bomb. Radiation {{was known to be}} dangerous and <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to ascertain the detailed effect of radiation on human health. Most of the subjects, Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E

50|$|The {{prediction}} model {{is created by}} exposing a group of monkeys to a radiation source (caesium-137). Radiological experiments are then conducted to study the radiobiological reactions of the main regulatory body systems (nervous, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, hematopoietic), and spermatozoa and cytogenetic response to irradiation and analysis of long-term effects of exposure (life expectancy and carcinogenesis). The experiment uses male rhesus macaque aged 3-5 years. They are divided into groups of 10-15 monkeys in each group. <b>The</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> so that mimic the real exposure of crew during the flight to Mars, including acute and chronic phases of disease.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, a raid {{took place}} at a {{laboratory}} belonging to the University of California, Riverside (UCR) {{that resulted in the}} removal of a monkey by the Animal Liberation Front. This monkey, called Britches (born March 1985), was a stump-tailed macaque who was born into a breeding colony at UCR. He was removed from his mother at birth, had his eyelids sewn shut, and had an electronic sonar device attached to his head—a Trisensor Aid, an experimental version of a blind travel aid, the Sonicguide—as part of a three-year sensory-deprivation study involving 24 infant monkeys. <b>The</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to study the behavioral and neural development of monkeys reared with a sensory substitution device.|$|E
50|$|Pseudowords {{are also}} {{sometimes}} called wug {{words in the}} context of linguistic experiments. This is because wug wʌg was one such pseudoword used by Jean Berko Gleason in her wug test 1958 experiments. Words like wug, which could have been a perfectly acceptable word in English but isn't due to an accidental gap, were presented to children. The experimenter would then prompt the children to create a plural for wug, which was almost invariably wugs wʌgz. <b>The</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to see if English morphophonemics would be applied by children to novel words. They revealed that even at a very young age, children have already internalized many of the complex features of their language.|$|E

50|$|Into the mid 1970s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project {{conducted}} {{other human}} radiation experiments. Radiation {{was known to}} be dangerous and <b>the</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to ascertain the detailed effect of radiation on human health. In Nashville, pregnant women were given radioactive mixtures. In Cincinnati, some 200 patients were irradiated over a period of 15 years. In Chicago, 102 people received injections of strontium and cesium solutions. In Massachusetts, 74 schoolboys were fed oatmeal that contained radioactive substances. In all these cases, the subjects did not {{know what was going on}} and did not give informed consent. The government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993, when President Bill Clinton ordered a change of policy. The resulting investigation was undertaken by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, and it uncovered much of the material included in The Plutonium Files.|$|E
