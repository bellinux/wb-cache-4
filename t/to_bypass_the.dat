5|$|Patent ductus arteriosus {{also appears}} in the breed. It is a {{condition}} where a small blood vessel connecting two major arteries does not close following birth. It can cause complications as it is positioned to allow the blood flow <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> lungs. It also appears in American Staffordshire Terriers.|$|E

5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|In Sabre Wulf, {{the player}} guides the pith-helmeted adventurer Sabreman through a {{two-dimensional}} maze. The player must reconstruct an amulet from its four pieces {{scattered throughout the}} maze <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> guardian at its exit, a cave {{that leads to the}} game's sequel, Underwurlde. The maze is presented in flip-screens such that the player views one static tile of the maze's grid at a time. For example, when Sabreman reaches the left edge of one screen, he continues the maze at the right edge of the next screen.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944 the Allies {{launched}} Operation Market Garden, {{an attempt}} by the British 2nd Army <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> Siegfried Line and advance into the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland.

5|$|Mathews and {{his troops}} {{also played a}} key role in the ending of the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 which erupted out of an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> {{requirement}} that new Sultans must be vetted by the British consul. During his time as first minister Mathews continued to be involved with the military and was part of two large campaigns, one to Witu and another to Mwele.|$|E
5|$|Montreal was {{incorporated}} {{as a city}} in 1832. The opening of the Lachine Canal permitted ships <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> unnavigable Lachine Rapids, while {{the construction of the}} Victoria Bridge established Montreal as a major railway hub. The leaders of Montreal's business community had started to build their homes in the Golden Square Mile (~) from about 1850. By 1860, it was the largest municipality in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several years, the highway was paved north towards Whitney. In the early 1960s, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the northernmost section of the highway.

5|$|While plans <b>to</b> {{construct}} <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> existed {{as late as}} 1985, {{the connection}} to the Queens Boulevard line at Northern Boulevard was built as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bypass.</b> A bellmouth was built {{at the end of}} the tunnel should construction on <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> ever commence.|$|R

Upon entering Allegany County, NY446 passes under the Southern Tier Expressway and becomes known as Water Street as it enters Cuba {{from the west}} upon traversing Oil Creek. The route continues eastward for three blocks to NY305 (Genesee Street), where both Water Street and NY446 terminate approximately a quarter-mile (0.40km) south of exit28 on the Southern Tier Expressway.|$|E
5|$|Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), {{under the}} command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, set their sights on the {{occupation}} of the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. General George S. Patton's Third Army was given the task of occupying the French region of Lorraine, while General Courtney Hodges's First Army was ordered to break through the front near Aachen. Hodges had initially hoped <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> city itself, believing it to be held only by a small garrison, which would presumably surrender once isolated.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s {{improvements}} {{included the}} construction of the Prescott Channel, designed to allow flood water <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> Three Mills tide mills. The channel included sluices to regulate water levels above it, but these became redundant once the tide mills ceased to operate, and eventually seized up. They were removed soon after parts of the Channelsea River were culverted.|$|E

Eisenhower {{initially}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> city to pursue other targets, but amid {{reports that the}} citizens were going hungry and Hitler's stated intention to destroy it, de Gaulle insisted {{that it should be}} taken immediately. French forces of the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc arrived from the west on 24 August, while the U.S. 4th Infantry Division pressed up from the south. Scattered fighting continued throughout the night, and by the morning of 25 August Paris was liberated.|$|E

WSDOT however is widening SR18 between I-5 and I-90, with only the segment between the Issaquah Hobart Road and I-90 yet to be completed, creating a full limited-access freeway between I-5 and I-90, southeast of I-405. While SR18 {{has been a part of}} some I-605 proposals, it only allows drivers <b>to</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> Greater Seattle area on the southern and eastern sides.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{business}} routes of US Highway 10 {{in the state}} of Michigan. They serve as connections from the main highway into Reed City, Clare and Midland. Additionally, there were another two business routes that connected US Highway 10 (US10) to the downtowns of Flint and Pontiac. All of these business routes are, or were, former sections of US10 that were marked Business US Highway10 (Bus.

50|$|There was {{considerable}} opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> {{on either side}} of the A140, by residents of the village of Tharston to the west, and those of the hamlet of Wood Green Common to the east.
