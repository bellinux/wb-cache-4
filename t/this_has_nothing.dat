This spawns an evil incarnation of himself, the Anti-Spank. DeathSpank must travel to the Fires of Bacon to destroy the thongs and the Anti-Spank. It will be the first DeathSpank title not to feature the titular character in its name; {{it has been reported that}} <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the departure of Ron Gilbert from Hothead Games.|$|E
25|$|The {{scholarly}} literature sometimes {{also uses}} the term 'esoteric doctrines.' <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with the}} meanings of 'esoteric' common today: it does not indicate a secret doctrine. For scholars, 'esoteric' indicates only that the unwritten doctrines were intended for a circle of philosophy students inside Plato's school (in Greek, 'esoteric' literally means 'inside the walls'). Presumably they had the necessary preparation and had already studied Plato's published doctrines, especially his Theory of Forms, which is called his 'exoteric doctrine' ('exoteric' means 'outside the walls' or perhaps 'for public consumption').|$|E

25|$|Klaas A. Posthuma {{argues that}} neither Tristan nor Isolde try {{for one moment}} to ignore their {{feelings}} of {{love for each other}} nor do they try to overcome them. On the contrary, they yield to their feelings with all their hearts – but secretly. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> whatsoever to do with the Schopenhauer doctrine. Another important point in this philosophy is Schopenhauer's opinion about finding happiness with one woman only, which he rejected – his reason for never marrying. But for Tristan there is only one woman, Isolde, with Death as alternative. And this leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was not Schopenhauer and his doctrine that were responsible for the creation of Wagner's sublime music drama but his unfulfilled love for the woman he met and loved during these years, Mathilde Wesendonck.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Paudash Lake is named after an Indian Chief, there is {{universal}} agreement among anthropologists and archeologists that the Ojibwa tribe of Ontario never established regular settlements in most of Haliburton. This was not simply due to the Indians' nomadic habits, but also due to the extremely long and harsh winters {{and the lack of}} major rivers bisecting the area for transportation. Another significant influence was {{the fact that}} the lakes in Haliburton were not a major food source. But this is actually irrelevant because it is common knowledge among Ojibwa themselves and among scholars of other aboriginal hunter-fisher-gatherer peoples, that they did not establish permanent settlements because they had to move from one site of hunting-fishing-gathering to another and stayed only as long as needed. (It would be analogous to how modern sports fishermen try one lake and another, one spot and another.) But <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with naming. As with the Eels Lake and Jacks Lake south of Paudash, it was the practice of early settlers - when the Indian presence still had strength - to name lakes after the apparent dominant Indian clan or extended family patriarch or chief. Jack's Lake was named after Jack Cow and Eels Lake after Eel Cow. It follows that settlers experienced the visits now and then of the Paudash family at Paudash Lake and that was how the name was established.|$|E

It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E

2500|$|He {{is highly}} {{critical}} of William Dembski's 2002 book No Free Lunch suggesting that although the counterintuitive No Free Lunch theorems of computer science do indeed rule out the generation of specified complexity in a specific technical sense, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Darwinism which {{is not trying to}} reach a pre-specified target, and of Michael Behe's 1996 book Darwin's Black Box which he characterises as [...] "cleverly argued, biologically informed — and wrong". He concedes that there are biological systems which are irreducibly complex in Behe's sense but suggests that [...] "An irreducibly complex system can be built gradually by adding parts that, while initially just advantageous, become — because of later changes — essential". He also suggests that, while he has [...] "utter confidence in Behe's biochemistry" [...] Behe [...] "is not at home in the technical evolution literature." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is {{seen when}} there is a cross of {{electrical}} reflexes as a muscle is stimulated. [...] Electromotor allochiria has been observed in the face, lower limbs, and upper limbs. [...] In these cases, a stimulus presented on the affected side caused contraction of the opposite facial muscles with a current so weak that the healthy facial did not react. [...] Another example is that pressure on one forearm caused movement of the opposite forearm. [...] The central fact is that an electrical stimulus may manifest its effect at a distant part of the nervous system. This distant part may be {{on the same side of}} the body or on the opposite side, naturally it is more often on the opposite side because the representation of corresponding contralateral limbs in the spinal cord are nearer to each other than homolateral limbs. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the confusion of the two sides that occurs in the patients mind when allochiria is present.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{speculate that}} maaser sheni {{developed as a}} tribute to the king; the Books of Samuel mention that the Israelites were ordered by Samuel (speaking on behalf of God) to give a tenth of everything to the king, seemingly referring to such a tribute in a passage (1 Samuel 8:15) which textual scholars believe belongs to the monarchial source, and predates both the Priestly Code and the Deuteronomic Code. [...] This is in contrast to the reading of the text which was a warning by Samuel to the Children of Israel about the abuses of power that a king may impose. There is no example of an Israelite king actually imposing such a 10% tax. Further, ma'aser sheni was retained for consumption by the farmer who produced the crop or redeemed by said farmer for money to be used by him and his family. Some scholars speculate that these tributes began to be used for public festivals, often including religious ones, and thus gradually came to be seen as associated with the priests. Once again, this is unlikely as the Levites who received ma'aser rishon were not priests (called [...] "kohanim"). The kohanim received terumah and terumat ma'aser from the Leviim, not ma'aser rishon, as would be thought if they had written the Torah to enhance their own agenda. Moreover, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with ma'aser sheni, which, once again, was retained by the farmer who was liable to separate the tithe.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Nutting {{recalled}} that Eden told him, [...] "What's all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him {{as you call}} it? I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, and if you and the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd better come to the cabinet and explain why." [...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E
