Most of the nine campaigns of the ambitious Emperor Constantine V to eliminate the young Bulgarian state, which suffered political crisis, failed in the mountain passes of the Balkan. In 811 the whole Byzantine army was destroyed in the Varbitsa pass and in 12th-13th centuries several other Byzantine forces shared that doom. The Bulgarians maintained many outposts and castles which guarded the passes and were able to locate an invading force and quickly inform the high command about any enemy moves.|$|E

In Sarmiento's words, the reason why he chose to provide Argentine context and use Facundo Quiroga to condemn Rosas's dictatorship is that [...] "in Facundo Quiroga I do not only see simply a caudillo, but rather a manifestation of Argentine life {{as it has been}} made by colonization and <b>the</b> <b>peculiarities</b> <b>of</b> the land".|$|E

The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of Abundantia, Ceres, and Juno, all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands. Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>peculiarities</b> <b>of</b> Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the [...] "immediacy" [...] of the trope of lying in state, which was otherwise dominant on Quattrocento wall tombs.|$|E

500|$|During the interregnum the szlachta {{prepared}} {{a set of}} rules and limitations for the future monarch to obey as a safeguard to ensure that the new king, {{who was going to be}} a foreigner, complied with <b>the</b> <b>peculiarities</b> <b>of</b> the Commonwealth's political system and respected the privileges of the nobility. As Henry of Valois was the first one to sign the rules, they became known as the Henrician Articles. The articles also specified the wolna elekcja (free election) as the only way for any monarch's successor to assume the office, thus precluding any possibility of hereditary monarchy in the future. The Henrician Articles summarized the accumulated rights of Polish nobility, including religious freedom guarantees, and introduced further restrictions on the elective king; as if that were not enough, Henry also signed the so-called pacta conventa, through which he accepted additional specific obligations. Newly crowned Henry soon embarked on a course of action intended to free him from all the encumbrances imposed, but the outcome of this power struggle was never to be determined. One year after the election, in June 1574, upon learning of his brother's death, [...] Henry secretly left for France.|$|E
500|$|In the Quarterly Review in 1821, the English {{writer and}} theologian Richard Whately {{published}} {{the most serious}} and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: [...] "we suspect one of Miss Austin's [...] great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into <b>the</b> <b>peculiarities</b> <b>of</b> female [...] heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it." [...] No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had {{set the tone for}} the Victorian era's view of Austen.|$|E
500|$|Whilst {{the reform}} did {{remove some of}} <b>the</b> <b>peculiarities</b> <b>of</b> the Stalinist era, [...] the overall impact of program created {{additional}} problems for the Soviet worker. In many areas, large variations in wages continued to exist. In engineering, for example, factory managers often ignored wage directives to try to encourage workers into roles that had lost much of their attraction after basic wages were cut to match pay throughout an area. Managers would therefore offer higher wages to new trainees. This {{had the effect of}} encouraging some to take a high-paid training position and then leave for a new training position upon qualification. In coal mining, managers had long held the ability to vary wages based on local considerations, such as geological factors or hazard levels, and after the reform they continued to vary wages through manipulation of quotas or rates to protect workers' wages. [...] A further problem with a centrally directed bonus system was that it encouraged factories to continue producing well established, more familiar products because it was far easier to overfulfill targets on familiar products than to start work on new items.|$|E
