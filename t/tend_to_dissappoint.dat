This channel has a nonnegative input (representing the transmitted optical intensity), which is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise.

For a fixed ratio of the allowed average power to the allowed peak power, the difference between the upper and the lower bound <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> zero as the average power <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> infinity and their ratio <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> one as the average power <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> zero.
