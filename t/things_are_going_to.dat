500|$|Although Brühl {{thought the}} film [...] "very realistic", he was {{dissatisfied}} with his character's authenticity. The actor felt [...] "attached" [...] to Jan, admiring his [...] "courage {{to want to}} change the way <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> <b>to</b> act to defend his beliefs", but thought it was [...] "very utopian and naive, that they take so much risk to break into some rich man's house to move things around." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I am so {{mental and}} sleepless and excited for this tour, [...] This is so {{different}} than anything you've seen from me in the past year. What's fantastic about [...] was I was able to plan it while I was on another tour that was on a much smaller scale, opening for the Dolls. This is going to be, like, the ultimate creative orgasm for me 'cause I'm ready to move on. I'm not restricted to a certain structure for my show anymore. No limitations. I'm free. [...] I {{want to have a}} clear schedule of the dimensions for each venue so that we can properly execute all the technology and visuals. I need to mentally prepare days in advance if <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be taken out; otherwise, I won't have a good show...Every show's gonna be an A show by the time I'm done screaming at everyone– 'Hang it! Hang everything! Find a place to hang it!' That's gonna be my motto." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with TV Guide Anders expressed the same sentiments, responding, [...] "I've watched Rachel struggle. She's always {{trying to do the}} right thing, or thinks she's {{trying to do the right}} thing, and it always gets messed up." [...] Anders also said that this song is [...] "her asking when <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work out," [...] and commented that it was [...] "emotional" [...] and thought that it would bring people to tears. [...] "Get It Right" [...] and [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] both premiered on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on February25,2011, and were performed in the episode [...] "Original Song", on March15,2011.

500|$|A {{co-owner}} for Swedish lifestyle magazine Millennium, Blomkvist {{is devoted}} to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government, attracting infamy for his tendency to [...] "go too far". Craig competed with Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Viggo Mortensen, and Johnny Depp as candidates for the role. Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of Cowboys & Aliens (2011) and Skyfall (2012) prompted Craig to postpone the casting process. Given the uncertainty surrounding Skyfall following Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's bankruptcy, Sony Pictures Entertainment and DreamWorks worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part. The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm's worldly cultural fabric. Having read the book amid its [...] "initial craze", Craig commented, [...] "It's one of those books you just don't put down" [...] There's just this immediate feeling that bad <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen and I think that's part of why they've been so readable for people." ...|$|E
500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it is not}} nonsense. You don't {{know what}} my {{feelings}} will be, if I think that such a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. But then you are so hard-hearted!" ...|$|R

The <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done well. Three or four new carts <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put on instead {{of some of the}} old ones, and there are ten first-rate horses coming in place of some of those that are getting past work. The stables are all being done up, and the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done tip-top. Curiously enough his name is the same as yours, John Holl." ...|$|R
500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
500|$|Martin E. Cirulis of Computer Gaming World {{wrote that}} Command & Conquer [...] "remains mainly a good, networkable version of Dune II". Cirulis found the game's {{interface}} intuitive and described its online component as [...] "sophisticated and easy-to-use", also praising its story for being [...] "as interesting as the actual tactics and gunfire", and commented that he [...] "would buy C {{just to see}} where <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end up". However, according to him, the developers failed [...] "to correct major shortcomings" [...] in Dune II, as its fog of war does not fit with the real-world setting, also finding fault with design choices in the game's missions, which he believed were structured like [...] "puzzles" [...] that allowed for {{only one way to}} win. Nevertheless, he concluded that it remained [...] "the best-looking and sounding strategy game yet" [...] despite its flaws, and that it was [...] "more than entertaining enough to make up for its shortcomings." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, T. Liam McDonald wrote that the game [...] "has all the playability of Dune II, but with more diverse units, more unusual scenarios, and impressively executed wraparound cutscenes." [...] McDonald called its combat a [...] "satisfying blend of action and strategy", and noted that this, combined with an attention to [...] "little details", made the game a [...] "success", also praising its cutscenes as [...] "terrifically executed". Although he was disappointed that the game lacked [...] "fancier terrain or another zoom level", McDonald concluded: [...] "This game is a whole lot of fun, so get it, play it, and love it like your own child." ...|$|E

"One {{demonstration}} never overturned {{government policy}} overnightor very rarelyand on something as strategic and massive as that", commented Seumas Milne {{in an interview}} with The Quietus online magazine in October 2012.

[...] Vooletich remained at Navy as the defensive coordinator for three seasons from 1987 to 1989.

[...] Shortly after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, Eisenhower {{wrote a letter}} to Prichard in which he confided [...] "this is a long tough road we have to travel." [...] In an oft-quoted passage, Eisenhower continued his comments to Prichard, noting that [...] "men that can do <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be sought out just as surely as the sun rises in the morning," [...] and [...] "fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performances are going to be discovered." ...|$|E
2500|$|John P. O'Neill was a {{counter-terrorism}} {{expert and}} the Assistant Director of the FBI until late 2001.

2500|$|Before {{the end of}} 1882, Junimea {{constituted}} {{itself into}} an independent group and was courted by the other political poles. In that context, Carp became Ambassador to the Austrian Court, appointed by the Brătianu cabinet. He mistrusted the Premier's sincerity, but argued: [...] "he cannot back out, everything is directed against Russia and for sure <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay put {{for two or three}} years." [...] His diplomatic skill was invoked in settling a major litigious issue, that of free navigation on the Danube. Brătianu hoped that Carp could persuade the German side in the Danube Commission to vote against the Austrians, allowing Romania to fully control its territorial waters. Carp accomplished his task with unexpected ease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assassination}} of Massoud {{is believed to}} have a connection to the September 11 attacks on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier.

2500|$|On 5 February the {{original}} English version treaty and its translation into Māori were put before {{a gathering of}} northern chiefs inside a large marquee on the lawn in front of Busby's house at Waitangi. Hobson read the treaty aloud in English and Williams read his Māori version. Māori chiefs (rangatira) then debated the treaty for five hours, much of which was recorded and translated by the Paihia missionary station printer, William Colenso. Rewa, a Catholic chief, who had {{been influenced by the}} French Catholic Bishop Pompallier, said [...] "The Māori people don't want a governor! We aren't European. It's true that we've sold some of our lands. But this country is still ours! We chiefs govern this land of our ancestors". Moka 'Kainga-mataa' argued that all land unjustly purchased by Europeans should be returned. Whai asked: [...] "Yesterday I was cursed by a white man.

2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} {{explained the}} incident, saying, [...] "Justin {{was supposed to}} pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra.

[...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand."

2500|$|Deidrick {{said that}} Chad is so [...] "love struck" [...] over Melanie that he doesn't even notice Gabi's feelings. On other hand, Melanie wants to {{maintain}} a friendship with Chad {{to keep him from}} hurting Abigail any further.

However, most of Chad and Melanie's relationship is plagued by the schemes of Chad's former flame, Gabi Hernandez (Camila Banus) who obsesses over Chad. In an interview with TV Guide, Banus explained that Gabi who is on the rebound after breaking up with Will falls for Chad after he comes to her rescue; [...] "she looks at [...] as her hero." [...] Though they are forced to work so closely together during their modeling career, Chad is [...] "oblivious" [...] to Gabi's feelings. Deidrick explained that Chad only takes on the modeling gig to make Gabi's life easier due to her split with Will. However, when it comes to romance, Chad is focused on his budding romance with Melanie. Deidrick stated: [...] "He cares about Gabi, but as far as he's concerned, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay completely platonic. Gabi has no idea about Melanie, so she thinks Chad's fair game." [...] Though he won't admit it, Chad knows they have a chemistry during their photo shoots.
