40|$|Peatlands {{provide a}} {{widespread}} terrestrial archive of Holocene environmental change. The taphon omy of peat is relatively simple, {{the range of}} evidence and proxies is wide, and dating methods have become more accurate and precise, such that the potential temporal resolution of records is high. Although long estab lished, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> as archives of Holocene change has undergone phases of decline and resurgence. Here, the variable exploitation of the peat archive is explored, and recent developments in peatland science as applied to Holocene records are reviewed {{with reference to the}} collection of papers in this Special Issue of The Holocene, which are arranged in four key themes: (1) records of Holocene climatic change; (2) peatland dynamics; (3) carbon accumulation; and (4) implications for conservation and management. The changing acceptance of peatlands as archives of Holocene climatic change is attributed to developments in understanding of the peatland system and geographical differences in the history of Holocene research. Recent developments in biological and geochemical proxies combined with improvements in chronological techniques have resulted in renewed interest in peatland palaeoclimate records. Peatlands are an important global carbon pool and it is clear that climate has influenced the efficiency of long-term carbon sequestration by these systems. Climate has also {{had an impact on the}} biodiversity and condition of peatlands, which creates problems in discerning cause and effect in sites affected by human activities, and in targeting remedial management. It is concluded that particular strengths of the archive are the current diversity of peat-based palaeoenvironmental research and the potential for multiproxy analyses to be applied to a range of research issues. Mire-based investigations can complement research in other realms, and are deserving of greater attention from researchers of other archives...|$|E

V diplomski nalogi smo z namenom zmanjšanja uporabe šote v hortikulturi preučili primernost obnovljivih vlaken in komposta za gojenje rastlin ter uporabo v substratih. Pripravljenim 27 -im mešanicam substratov smo izmerili fizikalne in kemijske parametre ter na njih preverili biološko odzivnost rastlin ječmena, kitajskega zelja in mačeh. Rezultati so pokazali, da so substrati, ki so sestavljeni na podlagi naravno obnovljivih vlaken, komposta in manjšega 30 % dodatka šote, dobri nadomestki tovarniško pripravljenim substratom, ki temeljijo na 100 % sestavi šote. Z zmanjševanjem deleža šote in povečanjem deleža komposta ter drugih naravnih vlaken lahko tako z veliko mero prispevamo k zmanjšanju ogljičnega odtisa, večji izrabi organskih odpadkov in ohranjanju koristnih šotnih habitatov.

Through the research we have studied the suitability of renewable fibers and compost for the plant growth and their use in various substrates. We measured physical and chemical parameters to all of the 27 pre-prepared mixtures of substrates and tested them to see a biological response of barley, Chinese cabbage and pansies. The results have shown that the composite substrates that are based on renewable fibers, compost, and the 30 % of added peat are good alternatives to the prefabricated substrates that are completely based on the peat. By reducing the specific proportion of the peat and increasing the proportion of the compost and other natural fibers, we can contribute to the reduction of a carbon footprint, organic waste and to the conservation of many valuable peat habitats...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the palaeohydrological reconstruction of a raised mire in Kilnagamagh, Co. Offaly, Ireland {{in order to}} investigate environmental influences on human activity in mires as represented by archaeological deposits, and the mire's potential for broader palaeoenviromnental reconstruction. The results are compared against trends in other mires in Ireland, the UK and Northwest Europe. Analytical techniques used include gross peat stratigraphic and archaeological field survey, testate amoebae, plant macrofossil and colorimetric humification analyses and radiocarbon dating. A Bronze Age wooden walkway in Kilnagarnagh Bog {{and a series of}} trackways from neighbouring bogs provide the archaeological focus of this study. It is shown that trackway construction, or the lack thereof, may be viewed in part as a response to changes in the environment. Very dry or very wet situations may not warrant trackway construction; however, simple models of behaviour occurring in either wet or dry situations may be misleading as local environmental conditions may be more complex. Some models <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> development typically suggest that external (allogenic) factors such as climate change control development. Others suggest that both external and internal (autogenic) processes combine to control development. In reconstructing environmental conditions it is important to separate these controls as this has implications for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> development as a proxy for climatic reconstruction. The timing of the most significant hydrological changes in KiInagarnagh suggests autogenic factors rather than regional climate change controlled development, with one exception; from c. 850 BC to around the seventh century AD mire growth was greatly retarded due to a sudden and long-term drop in the water table which may ultimately have been driven by a regional change to wetter conditions.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the complex role that mineral dust and its feedbacks play in the Earth's climate system is limited by its highly variable nature {{in space and time}} and a lack of data reflecting this variability. Paleorecords of dust provide a means by which we can examine the response of dust over time under very different climatic conditions. These records also supply the data (dust deposition rates, grain size, mineralogy and provenance) necessary to validate models of the dust cycle. Ombrotrophic peat is hydrologically isolated and therefore, like ice, records atmospheric deposition alone. Peatlands have a wide distribution globally, particularly in formerly glaciated regions, and are established environmental archives which provide continuous, high-resolution, datable records of atmospheric deposition and climate change. The use of peat for reconstructing dust deposition has been demonstrated, but as yet, not systematically examined. Their use as an archive of dust deposition must be further tested before they can be used to improve on the relatively poor spatial coverage of current terrestrial dust records (e. g., loess, lake sediments, dune building records). We present here a first focussed effort to reconstruct past changes in dust deposition through loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, humification and inorganic geochemistry data using a peat sequence from Store Mosse in southern Sweden. This deposit has been studied previously and reveals a record that extends back some 5000 years. LOI data, in combination with elemental chemistry of the samples, aids in identifying those depths where the observed signal is atmospheric in source only. Humification analyses and bulk density are used as a proxy for surface wetness and allows for the linking of broader climatic changes (precipitation, evaporation, temperature) with fluctuations in dust deposition rates and changes in grain character (grain size, surface roughness). The inorganic geochemistry provides a means to quantify dust deposition as well as make a first attempt at source tracing of the deposited materials; this is important in terms of reconstructing changes in paleo wind regimes. Past variations in aeolian activity in Scandinavia are relatively unknown. Dune building records from Denmark and elsewhere around Europe show several periods of inland sand invasion and dune building during the Holocene. These are linked to cooler and stormier climates caused by shifts in the North Atlantic Oscillation and/or movement of the polar front. We compare the dust deposition record from Store Mosse with available dune building records and records of storminess from the region {{in order to make a}} preliminary assessment of <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> as paleo records of dust deposition.

40|$|Peatland is an {{increasingly}} important land resource for livelihood, economic development, and terrestrial carbon storage. Kubu Raya and Pontianak Districts of West Kalimantan rely their future agricultural development on this environmentally fragile <b>peatland</b> because <b>of</b> the dominance (58 % and 16 % area, respectively) of this land in the two districts. A study aimed to evaluate land use changes on peatland and to develop strategies for sustainable peatland use and management for agriculture.

The study showed that within 22 years (1986 - 2008), the area of peat forests in Kubu Raya and Pontianak Districts decreased as much as 13. 6 % from 391, 902 ha to 328, 078 ha. <b>The</b> current <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peatland</b> in the two districts include oil palm plantation (8704 ha), smallholder rubber plantation (13, 186 ha), annual crops (15, 035 ha), mixed cropping of trees and annual crops (22, 328 ha), and pineapple farming (11, 744 ha).

About 34, 362 ha (9. 7 %) of uncultivated log-over forest and shrubs can potentially be developed for agriculture.

40|$|Peatlands in Indonesia are {{protected}} by regulations that forbid the conversion of these lands into plantations. However, peat fires here {{have been found to}} be a major source of smoke that travels across national boundaries creating regional haze. Despite these regulations, more than a quarter of all Indonesian oil palm plantations are on peat. This paper argues that patronage networks within the Indonesian oil palm sector have been a major factor in <b>the</b> unsustainable <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> there. Rampant patronage politics have made it easy for well-connected companies to skirt regulations to obtain licenses for these lands. Decentralization has further encouraged this practice at the regional level, as regional elites are eager to reap the benefits of local investments. In addition, clients are able to exert their influence over state decisionmaking to ensure that any changes to the licensing process does not jeopardize their access to these lands. These converted lands are highly fire-prone. Furthermore, some companies have been found to use fire as a cheap way to clear the land for planting. Hence, this paper argues that transboundary haze in Southeast Asia can be traced back to the ongoing oil palm boom in Indonesia, bolstered by patronage networks...|$|R

Experiments were designed to investigate the temporal change in tephra profiles over a 24 -month study period, the horizontal distribution of tephra and the microscopic distribution of tephra particles within the peat. Tephra concentration profiles show {{that the majority of}} tephra shards are retained within the top cm of peat with small numbers penetrating to a maximum of 6 cm depth. This distribution would be reduced as the peat is compressed with subsequent accumulation. Examination of thin sections from the plots indicates that tephra movement may be dependent on the microscopic structure of the peat, especially porosity. These results provide general support to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> tephrochronology although further work will be required, particularly in other peat types and environments...|$|R

At the SL-SB site, only three ndl-PCB (PCB 138, PCB 153, PCB 180) were quantified at individual concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1  ng g− 1 dw (0.06 – 0.1  ng g− 1 fw). In general, method quantification limits of ndl-PCB are {{higher than those of}} dl-PCB due to the ubiquitous presence of ndl-PCB, also in laboratory blank samples. Therefore, dl-PCB have been quantified whereas ndl-PCB usually were not. Still, the low frequency of quantification was surprising, as marker PCB are common pollutants in German forest soils (up to 106  ng g− 1 dw), particularly in western Germany [1]. Similar to our results, concentrations of marker PCB (0.19 – 0.84  ng g− 1 dw, mainly PCB 101, PCB 153) were mostly close to or below the MQL in Swedish moss (Pleurozium schreberi or Hylocomium splendens) [8]. Levels for Σ 25 PCB observed in moss (Drepanocladus aduncus) from Svalbard were in the same order (0.43 – 1.16  ng g− 1) with Mono- to HexaCB being the dominant homologues [63].

Owing to a scarcity of agricultural land, there is an increasing interest {{to invest in the}} development of lowland peat swamps. Drainage is needed to make these waterlogged peat swamps suitable for agriculture or other land use. As soon as the peat swamps are drained the process of irreversible subsidence commences. This subsidence is a well-known and hard-to-overcome constraint to <b>the</b> development and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> tropical <b>peatlands.</b> Drainage and fires associated with the agricultural development and logging release increasing amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. The dilemma is how {{to strike a balance between}} two contrasting needs, namely, intensive drainage in order to produce more food and less intensive drainage to avoid irreversible damage to these fragile eco-systems. In this paper, a new water management strategy for <b>the</b> sustainable <b>use</b> <b>of</b> tropical <b>peatland</b> is proposed. In this strategy, emphasis shifts from drainage to water control. The challenge therefore is to strive for a balance between water levels allowing optimal crop production and water levels minimising peat subsidence. Under the new system, water levels in the drainage system will be maintained at the highest feasible level. These high levels have implications for the design, implementation and operation of the water management system. It will result in a water management system with narrowly spaced shallow drains in combination with an intensive network of control structures. It should be remembered, however, that subsidence cannot be completely arrested; it is the price one has to pay for utilising lowland peat swamps...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands are wetland {{ecosystems}} that accumulate dead {{organic matter}} (i. e. peat) when plant litter production outpaces peat decay, usually under conditions of frequent or continuous waterlogging. Collectively, global peatlands store vast amounts of carbon (C), equalling if not exceeding the amount of C in the Earth’s vegetation, and they encompass a remarkable diversity of forms, from the frozen palsa mires of the northern sub-arctic to the lush swamp forests of the tropics, each with their own characteristic range of fauna and flora. In this review we explain what peatlands are, how they form and the contribution that peatland science can make {{to our understanding of}} global change. We explore the variety in formation, shape, vegetation type and chemistry <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> across the globe while stressing the fundamental features that are common to all peat-forming ecosystems. We consider the impacts that past, present, and future environmental changes, including anthropogenic disturbances, have had and will have on peatland systems, particularly in terms of their important roles in carbon storage and the provision of ecosystem services. <b>The</b> most widespread <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> today are for forestry and agriculture, both of which require drainage that results in globally significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), a greenhouse gas. Climatic drying and drainage also increase the risk of peat fires that are a further source of greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2 and methane, CH 4) to the atmosphere, as well as causing negative human health and socio-economic impacts. We conclude our review by explaining the roles that palaeoecological, experimental and modelling studies can play in allowing us to build a more secure understanding <b>of</b> how <b>peatlands</b> function, how they will respond to future climate- and land management-related disturbances, and how best we can improve their resilience in a changing world...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify the contradictions between the Finnish and Swedish studies and provide a better basis for energy policy {{decision-making}} by summarizing the recent scientific knowledge about the climate impacts of peat fuel utilization chains based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. A starting point for this study was to carry out a critical review of Finnish and Swedish life cycle studies of the climate impacts of peat fuel utilization chains. The critical review was conducted according to the recommendations of international standards and its aim was to ensure that the methods, data and interpretation of results were carried out in a scientifically and technically valid way. During the review the available data (mostly published) on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances and the radiative forcing impacts of GHGs were gathered and updated.   The re-calculations showed that the climate impact of "Pristine mire – afforestation" utilization chain is similar to the climate impact of coal utilization, whereas the result of the peat utilization chain "Pristine mire – restoration" is slightly worse than for the coal utilization chain. The results were similar in the reviewed studies. The peat utilization chain "Forestry-drained peatlands – afforestration" causes a slightly higher climate impact on average than the coal utilization chain does. From the viewpoint of peat utilization the result was similar to the result of Finnish study. According to the reviewed studies <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> cultivated <b>peatlands</b> causes <b>the</b> lowest climate impact compared to the climate impacts <b>of</b> the other <b>peatlands.</b> However, cultivated peatlands do not play important role as an extraction area for peat utilization. From the viewpoint of peat utilization the result <b>of</b> cultivated <b>peatland</b> was worse compared to the result produced by the Finnish and Swedish studies. The climate impacts of peat fuel utilization chains are mostly caused by the carbon dioxide released by peat combustion. These emissions are known quite  well. However, the emission assessments of different peat types include large uncertainty before, during and after peat extraction. In spite of that it can be said that land change options related to peat extraction and after-treatments have very limited effects on the climate impacts of peat utilization chain...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and hydrologic characteristics <b>of</b> cutover <b>peatlands</b> often inhibit the regeneration <b>of</b> typical <b>peatland</b> vegetation, particularly the keystone peat-forming genus Sphagnum, {{in the absence}} of active rehabilitation measures. Peatland restoration and rehabilitation techniques developed {{over the past two decades}} focus on the establishment of a Sphagnum carpet on cutover surfaces, largely through amelioration of hydrologic conditions. More recently there has also been increased interest in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> cutover <b>peatlands</b> as sites for producing Sphagnum biomass commercially on a renewable basis, as this can be substituted for the slightly decomposed peat currently <b>used</b> in <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> horticultural growing substrates. As a result, there is interest in better understanding the soil water dynamics and hydrologic controls on productivity in regenerating Sphagnum -dominated cutover peatlands, which differ in many regards from natural <b>peatlands.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to describe the structural evolution, hydraulic properties, and productivity dynamics of Sphagnum layers regenerating on cutover peat surfaces, ranging from 3 - 43 years in age. This has applications to Sphagnum biomass production as well as to understanding the longer-term trajectory <b>of</b> restored cutover <b>peatlands.</b> 	 The Shippagan peatland, a block-cut cutover peatland located in northeastern New Brunswick, has been the site of investigations into Sphagnum biomass production on cleared cutover surfaces since 2004. Extensive spontaneous regeneration of Sphagnum has also occurred across much of the site outside the experimental areas. For this study, plots were established in seven areas of the site where regeneration began at different times. The hydrology (water table depth, distribution of soil moisture, evaporation, precipitation input) of each plot was monitored over the study season (May 24 to August 13, 2013) and gross ecosystem productivity measured frequently using chamber techniques. Following the study season, multiple vertical profiles were extracted from each plot for laboratory determination of the hydrophysical properties (bulk density, porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture characteristic, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity–pressure relation) of the regenerated layers and underlying cutover peat. 	 The regenerated layers follow a pattern of evolution whereby the bulk density and retention capacity of the base of the profile (the ~ 5 cm thick layer directly overlying the cutover peat) increase with age as a result of decomposition and compaction. While the amount of water that can be held against tension within the profile appears to increase with the age of the regenerated layer, there is a general trend towards decreasing near-surface (0 - 3 cm depth) water content for a given depth of water table as the thickness of the regenerated layer increases. Near-surface water content is strongly correlated (p 40 year old plots but not at the 40 cm below the surface or when no direct precipitation is received for 16 days. Conversely, productivity may be frequently limited at the site by above-optimal water contents. Based on analysis of productivity response to changes in near-surface water content, a volumetric water content range of 0. 13 to 0. 50 is identified as optimal for growth. 	 The spontaneously regenerated layers studied here appear to be on a trajectory of structural and hydrologic evolution favouring peat formation, which is encouraging for the long term prospects <b>of</b> restored cutover <b>peatlands.</b> The Sphagnum species studied are tolerant to at least moderate water table drawdowns, though they may be less tolerant to periods of especially high water table, and biomass production operations using these species should take this into consideration. The large predominance of capillarity as a water source, and the hydrologic connectivity between the regenerated layers and cutover peat, imply that control of subsurface water level is an effective means of optimizing hydrologic conditions for biomass production. This study is the first to specifically describe the ecohydrology and long term structural evolution of Sphagnum regenerating on cutover peat surfaces...|$|R

Against this background we analyse opportunities to reorganise agricultural <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatland.</b> As it is assumed that the potential to reduce land-use intensity greatly depends on local socio-economic conditions which are likely to vary across different regions, six representative sample regions are surveyed. To analyse microeconomic effects with simultaneous consideration of local diversity, stakeholder workshops and extensive farm surveys were undertaken in all regions. First results indicate that a reorganisation <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> <b>use</b> causes severe loss of agricultural income and necessitates financial compensation for farmers. However the results also show that the potential of rearrangement varies significantly according to regional conditions. agricultural <b>peatland</b> <b>use,</b> reduction <b>of</b> greenhouse gases, farm survey, economic consequences, Land Economics/Use, Q 24, Q 54, R 58,...|$|R

"Life cycle assessment" - called the method of LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) which is commonly called the "cradle to grave" - that is, from extraction of raw materials, through processing, exploitation, to the storage of waste.

40|$|Peatlands in Europe {{has formed}} a {{significant}} sink for atmospheric CO 2 since the last glacial maximum. Currently they are estimated to hold ca. 42 Gt carbon {{in the form of}} peat and are therefore a considerable component in the European carbon budget. Due to the generally wet soil conditions in peatlands they are also significant emitters of the strong greenhouse gas (GHG) methane (CH 4) and in some cases also of nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The EU funded CarboEurope-GHG Concerted Action attempts to develop a reliable and complete greenhouse gas budget for Europe and this report aims to provide a review and synthesis of the available information about GHG exchanges in European peatlands and their underlying processes. A best estimate for all the European countries shows that some are currently sinks for atmospheric CO 2 while others are sources. In contrast, for CH 4 and N 2 O, only the sources are relevant. Whilst some countries are CO 2 sinks, all countries are net GHG emitters from peatlands. The results presented, however, carry large uncertainties, which cannot be adequately quantified yet. One outstanding uncertainty is <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> land <b>use</b> types, particular in Russia, the largest European peat nation. The synthesis of GHG exchange, nevertheless, indicates some interesting features. Russia hosts an estimated 41 % <b>of</b> European <b>peatlands</b> and contributes most to all GHG exchanges (CO 2 : 25 %, CH 4 : 52 %, N 2 O: 26 %, Total: 37 %). Germany is the second-largest emitter (12 % of European total) although it contains only 3. 2 % <b>of</b> European <b>peatlands.</b> The reason is <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peatland</b> area for intensive cropland and grassland. The largest CO 2 emitters are countries with large agricultural peatland areas (Russia, Germany, Belarus, Poland), the largest N 2 O emitters are those with large agricultural fen areas (Russia, Germany, Finland). In contrast, the largest CH 4 emitters are concentrated in regions with large areas of intact mires, namely Russia and Scandinavia. High average emission densities above 3. 5 t C-equiv. ha- 1 are found in the Southeast Mediterranean, Germany and the Netherlands where agricultural <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> is intense. Low average emission densities below 0. 3 t C-equiv. ha- 1 occur where mires and peatland forests dominate, e. g. Finland and the UK. This report concludes by pointing at key gaps in our knowledge about peatland carbon stocks and GHG exchanges which include insufficient basic information on areal distribution <b>of</b> <b>peatlands,</b> measurements <b>of</b> peat depth and also a lack of flux datasets providing full annual budgets of GHG exchanges...|$|R

40|$|The regional/national carbon (C) stock <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> {{is often}} poorly characterised, even for {{comparatively}} well-studied areas. A key obstacle to better estimates of landscape C stock is {{the scarcity of}} data on peat depth, leading to simplistic assumptions. New measurements of peat depth become unrealistically resource-intensive when considering large areas. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} maximise <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pre-existing datasets. Here we propose that one potentially valuable and currently unexploited source of peat depth data is palaeoecological studies. We discuss the value of these data and present an initial compilation for Scotland (United Kingdom) which consists of records from 437 sites and yields an average depth of 282 cm per site. This figure is likely to be an over-estimate of true average peat depth and is greater than figures used in current estimates <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> C stock. Depth data from palaeoecological studies have the advantages of wide distribution, high quality, and often the inclusion of valuable supporting information; but also the disadvantage of spatial bias due to the differing motivations of the original researchers. When combined with other data sources, each with its own advantages and limitations, we believe that palaeoecological datasets can make an important contribution to better-constrained estimates of peat depth which, in turn, will lead to better estimates <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> landscape carbon stock...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe yield {{potential}} of oil palm planted on peat land {{has always been}} a controversial subject. Most past soil research on oil palm yield on peat land was mainly based on the depth and drainability. Little attention was given to the impact of peat characteristics on oil palm from a yield perspective. This study tests the hypothesis that physical soil properties such as peat maturity, presence of wood, depth and nature of underlying substratum affects oil palm yield. The initial study involved the evaluation of soil mapping units on estates in Sibu, Sarawak, East Malaysia and from this exercise of four organic soil mapping units which reflected the different characteristics of soils were selected. Data on peat depth, presence and absence of decomposed and undecomposed wood, nature of underlying substratum and peat maturity (fibric, sapric and hemic) were collected, analyzed and interpreted. Comparisons were also made on mineral soil found at the same location. Yield data were analyzed from primary sources from oil palm estates. Results show that different types of peat have significant effect on oil palm yield ranging between 9. 47 - 22. 92 mt/ha. Peat maturity has the most significant effect on yield. Sapric peat showed a yield range of 19. 48 - 22. 92 mt/ha as compared to hemic peat ranging between 9. 47 - 13. 37 mt/ha. Palms planted on soils with sandy substratum showed significant 18 - 142 % higher yields compared to those over marine clay as underlying material. No significant differences were observed in the yields due to the different depths and presence/absence of wood as a single factor. However, a combined factor of peat maturity and presence with nature of wood do have significant impact on yield. The study further confirms that sandy spodosol like Bako series perform 30 - 40. 44 % lower yields compared to peat soils such as Telong and Naman series. The results are important as peat areas with specific physical soil properties and showing poor yields can been left for conservation prior to development. Thus selective development based on semi detailed soil surveys producing maps giving peat characteristics and its impact to oil palm yield is possible. However, a more balanced view and future research should be emphasised to other issues such as cost <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> compared to the price of crude palm oil in the world market, biodiversity, social issues, Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and potentials of improving productivity on existing organic and mineral soils need to be further explored. The study therefore challenges the existing believe that peat depth is very significant in determining oil palm yield. The study also enhances the need for soil surveys for land use decisions and wise <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>peatlands.</b> Further research is recommended to narrow the knowledge gaps and uncertainties on peatland...|$|R

40|$|Methane {{emissions}} from northern high latitude wetlands {{are one of}} the largest natural sources of atmospheric methane, contributing an estimated 20 % of the natural terrestrial methane emissions to the atmosphere. Methane fluxes vary among wetland types and are generally higher in peatlands, wetlands with > 40 cm of organic soil, than in wetlands with mineral soils. However, permafrost aggradation in peatlands reduces methane fluxes through the drying of the peat surface, which can decrease both methane production and increase methane oxidation within the peat. We reconstruct methane {{emissions from}} peatlands during <b>the</b> Holocene <b>using</b> a synthesis <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> environmental classes determined from plant macrofossil records in peat cores from > 250 sites across the pan-arctic. We find methane emissions from peatlands decreased by 20 % during the Little Ice Age due to the aggradation <b>of</b> permafrost within <b>peatlands</b> during this period. These bottom-up estimates of methane emissions for the present day are in agreement with other regional estimates and are significantly lower than the peak in peatland methane emissions 1300 years before present. Our results indicate that methane emissions from high latitude wetlands have been an important contributor to atmospheric methane concentrations during the Holocene and will likely change in the future with permafrost thaw...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Determination of {{the spatial}} extent <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> is {{important}} for the evaluation of soil carbon stocks. At European Level {{there is a need to}} provide accurate and updated estimate of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>peatland.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> national data with EU wide land cover mapping shows that there is limited compatibility between the different data sets. The aim of the present study is to test a methodology of standardized mapping and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> at regional level (national to supra-national bio-climatic regions) based on the enhanced integration of existing thematic maps through GIS analysis in combination with remote sensing, using Estonia as study case. Existing national maps and field inventory <b>of</b> Estonian <b>peatlands</b> have been used for a GIS based evaluation <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> relevant information contained in Corine Land Cover. Remote sensing has been employed in 2 ways: a multispectral approach using Landsat TM and a phenology oriented time series analysis of SPOT VEGETATION NDVI both implemented for the entire territory of Estonia. The remote sensing results are evaluated against the existing high resolution Estonian map <b>of</b> <b>peatlands.</b> In the case study it could be shown that peatlands are both spectrally and phenologically clearly distinct from other land cover types and therefore have a good potential to allow semiautomated mapping over large areas with relatively high accuracy, which lays the basis for efficient montoring and mapping <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> change...|$|R

40|$|Boreal peatlands play a {{major role}} in carbon and water cycling and other global {{environmental}} processes but understanding this role is constrained by inconsistent representation <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> on, or omission from, many global land cover maps. The comparison <b>of</b> several widely <b>used</b> global and continental-scale databases on peatland distribution with a detailed map for the St. Petersburg region of Russia showed significant under-reporting <b>of</b> <b>peatland</b> area, or even total omission. Analysis of the spatial agreement and disagreement with the detailed regional map indicated that the error of comission (overestimation) was significantly lower than the error of omission (underestimation) which means, that overall, peatlands were correctly classified as such in coarse resolution datasets but a large proportion (74 – 99 %) was overlooked. The coarse map resolution alone caused significant omission <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> in the study region. In comparison to categorical maps, continuous field mapping approach utilizing MODIS sensor data showed potential for a greatly improved representation <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> on coarse resolution maps. Analysis of spectral signatures <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> with different types of surface vegetation suggested that improved mapping <b>of</b> boreal <b>peatlands</b> on categorical maps is feasible. The lower reflectance <b>of</b> treeless <b>peatlands</b> in the near- and shortwave-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum is consistent with the spectral signature of sphagnum mosses.

40|$|AbstractGlobally, the {{historic}} and recent exploitation <b>of</b> <b>peatlands</b> through management {{practices such as}} agricultural reclamation, peat harvesting or forestry, have caused extensive damage to these ecosystems. Their value is now increasingly recognised, and restoration and rehabilitation programmes are underway to improve some of the ecosystem services provided by peatlands: blocking drainage ditches in deep peat {{has been shown to}} improve the storage of water, decrease carbon losses in the long-term, and improve biodiversity. However, whilst the restoration process has benefitted from experience and technical advice gained from restoration <b>of</b> deep <b>peatlands,</b> shallow peatlands have received less attention in the literature, despite being extensive in both uplands and lowlands. <b>Using</b> <b>the</b> experience gained from the restoration <b>of</b> the shallow <b>peatlands</b> <b>of</b> Exmoor National Park (UK), and two test catchments in particular, this paper provides technical guidance which {{can be applied to the}} restoration <b>of</b> other shallow <b>peatlands</b> worldwide. Experience showed that integrating knowledge of {{the historic}}al environment at the planning stage of restoration was essential, as it enabled the effective mitigation of any threat to archaeological features and sites. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> bales, commonly employed in other upland ecosystems, was found to be problematic. Instead, ‘leaky dams’ or wood and peat combination dams were used, which are both more efficient at reducing and diverting the flow, and longer lasting than bale dams. Finally, an average restoration cost (£ 306  ha− 1) for Exmoor, below the median national value across the whole of the UK, demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of these techniques. However, local differences in peat depth and ditch characteristics (i. e. length, depth and width) between sites affect both the feasibility and the cost of restoration. Overall, the restoration <b>of</b> shallow <b>peatlands</b> is shown to be technically viable; this paper provides a template for such process over analogous landscapes...|$|R
