Bringing together researchers from disciplines across the fields of Fine Art and Design, the exhibition posed {{a number of questions}} about the role of arts practice in academic research, its unique character, and its particular challenges. For the exhibiting researchers, pinpointing whereabouts you are is about marking a particular moment in the research process, pausing to reflect and take stock of their individual journey so far and to consider the next steps. In that spirit, rather than deferring the questions posed by the exhibition, they tackled them head-on through accompanying events organised in collaboration with the Centre for Contemporary Arts. By bringing their work out of the studio, the group hoped to not only shed light on the thought-provoking and innovative research undertaken at Glasgow School of Art, but to enliven the research through conversation with its new audience.

40|$|Plutonium Futures [...] The Science 2006 {{provided}} {{opportunities to}} examine present {{knowledge of the}} chemical and physical properties of plutonium and other actinides in complex media and materials; to discuss the current and emerging science (chemistry, physics, materials science, nuclear science, and environmental effects) of plutonium and actinides relevant to enhancing global nuclear security; and to exchange ideas. This international conference also provided a forum for illustrating and enhancing capabilities and interests, and assessing issues in these areas. U. S. and international scientists, engineers, faculty, and students from universities, national laboratories, and DOE's nuclear complex were encouraged to participate and make technical contributions. The Conference ran from Sunday, July 9 <b>th</b> through <b>Thursday,</b> July 13 <b>th.</b> A popular aspect of the conference was the opening tutorial session on Sunday afternoon intended for students and scientists new {{to the area of}} plutonium research. The tutorial was well attended by novices and veterans alike, and featured such diverse topics as; plutonium metallurgy, plutonium in the environment, and international arms control and nonproliferation. Two plenary lectures began each morning and each afternoon session and highlighted the breakout sessions on coordination/organometallic chemistry, solid-state physics, environmental chemistry, materials science, separations and reprocessing, advanced fuels and waste forms, phase transformations, solution and gas-phase chemistry, compounds and complexes, electronic structure and physical properties, and more. Chemistry Highlights [...] Among the many chemistry highlights presented in this proceedings are the overview of concepts and philosophies on inert nuclear fuel matrices and concerns about the ever-increasing amounts of minor actinides and plutonium generated in the fuel cycle. The various ideas involve multiple reduction schemes for these materials, suggesting fuels for 'burning' or 'cradle-to-grave' accountability for various reactor types. Related work is presented on identification of the unique reaction mechanisms and identification of the intermediate products, including Pu(III), {{at the end of the}} PUREX process. In the important area of nuclear forensics, actual scenarios of nuclear materials confiscation and the successes of applying forensics protocols to determine attribution and possible intention are provided. In the area of reactor incidents, there is no other place on Earth like the Chernobyl Site Object Shelter and radioactive aerosol particle characterization studies reflect an important effort described herein. An additional report from another unique environmental site presents results on radionuclide monitoring, fate, and transport in the ecosystem of the Yenisei River in the Krasoyarsk region. In the area of nuclear waste disposal, a study of the ion irradiation damage to pyrochlore compounds with varying amounts of host elements and actinide dopants is presented. Papers on both the aqueous and nonaqueous chemistry of plutonium and other actinides are presented including anhydrous coordination chemistry and redox behavior in the presence of humic materials and the their sorption on common minerals in the environment. Also published herein are reports on the field of anhydrous coordination chemistry of the transuranic elements where there is scarce information. Solid-State and Materials Highlights [...] Plutonium solid-state and materials research is represented in these proceedings by a wealth of leading edge discovery class research. The breadth of this research is reflected in the topics covered: solid-state; materials science; superconductivity; phase changes, phonons, and entropy; electronic structure and physical properties; surface science and corrosion; and radiation effects, defects, impurities, and property changes. Indeed the scientific challenge and excitement of plutonium can best be highlighted by quoting the tutorial prospectus of Drs. Sarrao and Schwartz. 'Plutonium has long been recognized as a complex and scientifically rich metal. The challenge of Pu derives from the fact that its 5 f electrons are neither fully localized nor fully itinerant. The resulting low energy scales lead to competing interactions and important entropic and lattice considerations as well. As a consequence, plutonium is on the verge of magnetic order and can be stabilized in a variety of crystal structures. The past several years have seen a renaissance in plutonium materials research. Despite significant progress and important breakthroughs, metallic plutonium remains a mystery at the frontier of materials research'. As we hope you will discover, much progress is being made that is reflected in these proceedings. More importantly however, is that the papers herein also inspire new experiments and theoretical approaches that we trust will not go unnoticed by the reader...|$|R
40|$|The 41 st World Congress of the International Council for Traditional Music {{was held}} at Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, from Wednesday July 13 <b>th</b> to <b>Thursday</b> July 19 <b>th,</b> 2011. Apart from {{attending}} many of the great variety of paper sessions, workshops and concerts, I participated actively in this conference in two main ways: 1. On Sunday July 17 th, at 1030 am, I chaired a ninety-minute workshop titled “Singing the West: Traditional Songs and Songs in the Tradition from the Prairies and British Columbia. ” This focused mainly, although not entirely, on the homesteading, logging, mining, and fishing songs in the Philip Thomas Collection. I introduced the Thomas Collection and the individual songs chosen from it, placing them in their historical and geographical contexts. The other participants in the workshop, as singers, were Rosaleen Gregory and Calgary musician John Leeder, the Honorary President of the Canadian Society for Tradiitonal Music. There was an audience of about one dozen, and there were lively discussions both {{during and after the}} song presentations. It appeared to be a very successful session. 2. On Monday July 18 th, at 3. 30 pm, I participated in a two-hour paper session titled “Pioneering Individuals and the Construction of Musical Narratives. ” As part of this session I duly delivered my paper on “Towards a Biography of Lucy Broadwood (1858 - 1929) : Problems and Perspectives. ” I accompanied the paper with a power-point presentation designed to highlight the structure of the paper and to provide visual images of Broadwood and several of her composer, musician and intellectual friends, including Ralph Vaughan Williams, Percy Grainger, Fanny Davies and Jessie Weston. The paper was well-received, but there was time for only about five minutes of discussion. This focused mainly on Broadwood’s complicated relationship to Cecil Sharp. I was asked why I called Sharp an acquaintance of Broadwood rather than a friend since they worked closely together on a few issues of the Journal of the Folksong Society. I tried to explain the class differences between the two collectors, and the somewhat exclusive nature of Broadwood’s social networks which included many people of whom Sharp had made enemies by criticizing them publicly. However, in retrospect I think that my explanation identified only part of the truth. Personality conflicts and ideological differences about the nature of English folksong also undoubtedly played a role in keeping their relationship rather distant. Given Sharp’s central role in the English Folksong Revival this is clearly an important issue that will require exploration in some depth in my anticipated book on Broadwood. It was useful to be alerted to it. More generally, the main purpose of my writing and delivering this paper was to help me clarify some of the principal themes and issues to be addressed in that book. I believe it served that purpose admirably and was therefore a valuable and worth-while experience. I was also glad to meet Elaine Keillor (a participant in the same session) and to learn about the Tom Kines archive of which she is curator. Lucy E. Broadwood was one of the leading folksong collectors in England during the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. One {{of the founders of the}} (English) Folk-Song Society, she subsequently played a major role in the organization from its creation in 1898 until her death in 1929, at which time she was serving as the Society’s President. Given her importance as a song-collector, scholar, editor and administrator, it is hardly surprising that Broadwood has attracted some interest among ethnomusicologists and folklorists. Dorothy De Val and Lewis Jones have both published brief articles surveying aspects of her career, while David Gregory has provided a detailed account of her early work as a folksong collector during the 1890 s. He has also written about her involvement with the foundation and early years of the Folk-Song Society (to 1903). To date, however, no scholar has explored in any detail Broadwood’s contribution to the Edwardian phase of the first English Folksong Revival and no one has yet attempted to write a book-length biography of this woman who made such an important contribution to English cultural life. Writing a biography of Broadwood poses some challenges. While her contribution to the first English folksong revival is what she is most remembered for nowadays, she was in fact a musician and intellectual of wide-ranging interests and social connections. At first glance these sometimes appear paradoxical or contradictory. Although fiercely loyal to the Broadwood extended family, she cultivated a wide range of other social acquaintances (from peers and painters to maidservants and artisans) and formed intimate friendships with several singers, instrumentalists and composers. They included singer James Campbell McInnes, composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and Percy Grainger, and musicians Fanny Davies and Juliette Folville. As a concert singer and pianist Broadwood was heavily involved with both the activities of the Peoples Concert Music Society and the Early English Music Revival, performing a variety of songs by contemporary English composers while editing several of Purcell’s music dramas. A sometime secretary of the Quest society and disciple of G. R. S. Mead, she was involved with Theosophy and she followed closely contemporary scholarship on Gnosticism, the origins of religion, and the historical Jesus. Although fascinated with the para-normal and a believer in (and practitioner of) thought-transference, she was of a skeptical and empirical disposition, ready to challenge the conventional wisdom of her age yet sharply critical of ideas she regarded as cranky or merely speculative. For example, although convinced that the orthodox view of the authorship of the Shakespeare plays erroneous, she nonetheless subjected the rival Baconian thesis to intense scrutiny. As an independent woman (she never married) she supported the suffragist movement but was also a member of the Primrose League, voted for the Conservative/Unionist coalition, and was intensely interested in Freemasonry (a semi-secret society which, as a female, she could not join). The challenge facing Broadwood’s biographer is not only to unravel and document these (and other) strands of her life but to understand and explain how they interrelated. How, for example, did her study of Freemasonry inform her folk-music scholarship? What relationship did she see between the music of Purcell and traditional English folksong? How could she combine her love of Irish music with her passionate hostility to Irish home-rulers and separatists? In what way did she believe folksong was an essential foundation for a renaissance of English art music? This paper aims to sketch the main themes in a putative biography of Lucy Broadwood and to offer some preliminary answers to questions such as these. It is based on both published primary sources and unpublished archival sources (including Broadwood’s diaries and correspondence) at the Surrey History Centre (Woking) and the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library (London) ...|$|R
