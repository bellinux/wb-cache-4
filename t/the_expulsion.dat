Except for the use in official anti-German propaganda, <b>the</b> <b>expulsions</b> became a taboo in Polish politics, public, and education for decades. German expellee organizations who did not accept the post-war territorial and population changes fueled Communist propaganda dismissing them as far-right revanchists.|$|R
