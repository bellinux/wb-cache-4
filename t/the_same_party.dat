5|$|Despite the Governor and Lieutenant Governor {{being elected}} on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>party</b> ticket, very often {{there have been}} public rifts between the two; for {{instance}} Gov. Marvin Mandel and Lt. Gov. Blair Lee IV; Gov. Harry R. Hughes and Lt. Gov. Samuel W. Bogley III; Gov. Schaefer and Lt. Gov. Melvin A. Steinberg., and Gov. Parris Glendening and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If both the offices governor and lieutenant governor are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the {{senior members of the}} state senate and state house of representatives of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>party</b> as the governor. The lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 amendment to the constitution made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

As there was no guarantee the two individuals would be members of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>party,</b> there was greater concern that {{the policies of the}} acting governor might be in direct conflict with those of the preceding governor.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the lieutenant governor was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>party.</b> After a 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted upon, as a single ticket. Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both the governor and lieutenant governor to four years. There is no limit to the number of terms a lieutenant governor may hold.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom {{employed}} by governors primarily {{because they were}} seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority. Governor James Whitcomb {{was the first to}} make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>party</b> as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.|$|E
