500|$|In {{a letter}} to his brother dated 19March 1819, Keats {{discussed}} indolence as a subject. He may have written the ode as early as March, but the themes and stanza forms suggest May or June 1819; when it is known he was working on [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", [...] "Ode on Melancholy", [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". During this period, Keats's friend Charles Armitage Brown transcribed copies of the spring odes and submitted them to publisher Richard Woodhouse. Keats wrote to his friend Sarah Jeffrey: [...] "he thing I have most enjoyed <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> writing an ode to Indolence." [...] Despite this enjoyment, however, he was not entirely satisfied with [...] "Ode on Indolence", and it remained unpublished until 1848.|$|E

2500|$|The border {{regions of}} Angola, Namibia and Zambia are {{dominated}} by small rivers which flood regularly {{during the rainy season}} from December to April. [...] Floods in 2008 lasted from February to March and affected 250,000 people in Namibia with 42 people losing their lives.

One cannot well bear to read his Books. There is no light upon Friedrich to tempt us; better light than Bielfeld's there could have been, and much of it: but he prudently, as well as proudly, forbore such topics. He approaches very near fertility and geniality in his writings, but never reaches it.

60|$|Suppose {{then we were}} to ask, {{whether the}} King has been richer than his {{predecessors}} in accumulated wealth, since {{the establishment of the}} plan of Favouritism? I believe it will be found that the picture of royal indigence which our Court has presented until <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> truly humiliating. Nor has it been relieved from this unseemly distress, but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people, and shaken their confidence in Parliament. If the public treasures had been exhausted in magnificence and splendour, this distress would have been accounted for, and in some measure justified. Nothing would be more unworthy of this nation, than with a mean and mechanical rule, to mete out the splendour of the Crown. Indeed, I have found very few persons disposed to so ungenerous a procedure. But the generality of people, it must be confessed, do feel a good deal mortified, when they compare the wants of the Court with its expenses. They do not behold the cause of this distress in any part of the apparatus of Royal magnificence. In all this, they see nothing but the operations of parsimony, attended with all the consequences of profusion. Nothing expended, nothing saved. Their wonder is increased by their knowledge, that besides the revenue settled on his Majesty's Civil List to the amount of 800,000 pounds a year, he has a farther aid, from a large pension list, near 90,000 pounds a year, in Ireland; from the produce of the Duchy of Lancaster (which we are told has been greatly improved); from the revenue of the Duchy of Cornwall; from the American quit-rents; from the four and a half per cent. duty in the Leeward Islands; this last worth to be sure considerably more than 40,000 pounds a year. The whole is certainly not much short of a million annually.|$|E
6000|$|As {{this new}} period {{of my life}} has brought with it my {{retirement}} [...] from active business in the world, it affords a good opportunity [...] for breaking off the commonly dry daily journal, or ledger as it [...] might almost be called, in which for seventy years I have recorded [...] the chief details of my outward life.
