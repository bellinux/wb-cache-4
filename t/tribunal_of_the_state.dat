Since 1867 Austrian monarchy recognized the equal status of all the nationalities and languages used in the large multicultural state. The 19th paragraph of new Austro-Hungarian Constitution (from the 21st of Dec., 1867) was meant to guarantee equal national rights to all the ethnic group in the empire. In Brody where more than ¾ of the population were the Jews (out of ca. 20.000 of inhabitants) there was only one public school with instruction in German and two schools with Polish as instruction medium. Galician Regional School Council (Landesschulrat) in Lviv allowed opening of two more schools refusing however the wish of Brody town commune to have German for instruction language in these new schools. Council was only willing to allow them to be in Polish. In the end, in 1880 Brody town commune appealed with the complaint to the <b>Tribunal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> (Reichsgericht) in Vienna, after unsuccessful attempts to defend their claim at the Galician Landeschulrat and the Ministry of Religion and Science.

40|$|Jacob Emerix de Matthis (1626 - 1696), {{judge of}} the Roman Sacra Rota for almost thirty years, is author of an {{important}} collection of Decisiones Sacrae Rotae Romanae, published in Rome in three volumes in 1701. The book, containing 1. 370 decisions of the Roman Sacra Rota, spanning the period 1669 - 1696, belongs to the genre of the collections of the European great tribunals’ decisions, spread all over Europe between 14 th- 15 th centuries and consolidated during 16 th- 17 th. Between the most numerous, authoritative and widespread collections, were the Decisiones of the Roman Sacra Rota, the supreme <b>tribunal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of the Church dating back to 14 th century, whose prestigious and authoritative jurisdiction was known and referred to all over Europe. As a {{judge of the}} Roman Sacra Rota and between its most important and expert reporters, Emerix wrote his Decisiones in order to clarify and consolidate the points of law under discussion and, at the same time, to preserve {{the decisions of the}} court allowing its judges to refer to useful precedents in future analogous cases. Emerix attention to the position of the legal problem, always accurately described, exemplifies the changes occurred since 16 th- 17 th centuries. First of all his decisiones, which belong to the individual collections, differ from the ones collected in the past, less detailed and more heterogeneous in their contents: being they written for personal usage, they normally included short legal maxims, consilia and personal opinions, while usually lacked the decision, which started to be put in writing systematically only after the reform of 1563. Secondly, the decision starts to be delivered no more on different legal questions, but on the «dubium generale totius causae complexivum», quite broadly worded, with the mention of the case as a whole. Emerix’ Decisiones mostly concern canon and civil law, with particular reference to matrimonial cases, execution of wills, land law. Anyway the decisions are by no means final judgments: according to rotal procedure, infact, the decisio was an autonomous extra-judicial act containing the reasoned conclusions of the twelve judges of the collegium, a simple account by the ponens about the learned opinions given by his colleagues in order to solve the dubium. The decisio would be communicated to the parties before the issue of the final judgment (sententia) − which, on the contrary, did not include motives – and delivered only if no new arguments or evidence were brought forward. This is why Emerix does not always report whether the decisions gave rise to a judgment or not: many cases were probably amicably settled and never brought to judgment, or were later superseded by other decisions in the same case. In tracing the authorities of the different arguments illustrated in the decisions, which appear as doctrinal works more than reports of cases, Emerix refers, as main sources of law, to the Corpus Juris Canonici and Corpus Juris Civilis, to the opinions of eminent canonists and civilians, to the opinions of past rotal judges and, most of all, to precedent decisions of the Sacra Rota itself, continuously cited. Emerix’ book enjoyed a wide international circulation and his decisions were frequently quoted in the main collections of 18 th- 19 th centuries. The enormous success and international circulation of the Decisiones of the Sacra Rota, highly demanded by the auditores of the court and by lawyers in general, who found in them the doctrinal opinions of expert and renowned jurists and the solution to various legal problems analytically exposed, proves that the Decisiones had became a fundamental reference point in the administration of justice all over Europe, an indispensable mean to clarify and to know law overcoming legal uncertainty generated by the crisis of the jus commune...|$|E
