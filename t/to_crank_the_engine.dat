50|$|A jump start, {{also called}} a boost, {{is a method}} of {{starting}} a vehicle with a discharged starting battery.

50|$|The term also {{referred}} to a (now obsolete) automobile engine component that lowered the supply voltage to the ignition system after <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> had been started. Because <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> causes a very heavy load on the battery, the system voltage can drop quite low during <b>cranking.</b> <b>To</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to start, <b>the</b> ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once <b>cranking</b> is finished, <b>the</b> normal operating voltage would overload the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system.|$|R
5000|$|The FZ {{came as a}} 4-stroke, four-cylinder, four-carburetor, {{naturally}} aspirated, {{air-cooled engine}} package mated with a six-gear constant mesh transmission, dropped into a rectangular tube frame that seemed pieced together from a modern standpoint, balanced upon a large rear mono shock hidden between the swingarm and subframe under the battery complementary to two smooth front forks. It has two large circular headlights iconic of Yamaha FZR's large and small displacement. The fuel tank has a triangular side profile that matches the frame well, with a flat top and a fuel petcock at the bottom left with an overflow hose fitting {{at the bottom of}} the front. The four Mikuni BS-30 carburetors utilize the [...] "Round-Slide" [...] design with the diaphragm assembly actuating the main needle jets, with plastic floats and brass slides. It uses two ignition coils (two cylinders each) controlled by a CDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) printed circuit board unit, and timed by a two brush [...] "Pick-Up Coil" [...] mounted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crank.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> oil doubles as the transmission's lubricant, wetting the manual clutch. The FZ-600 was air-cooled however, with a radiator-looking oil cooler mounted on the front of the frame between <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and front wheel. It also had a thundering four-into-one exhaust. It has a 4-fuse, fuse block providing for the headlights, turn signals, rectifier/regulator, etc.|$|R
50|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{invention}} lay in the realization that a relatively small motor, driven with higher voltage and current than would be feasible for continuous operation, could deliver enough power <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for starting. At the voltage and current levels required, such a motor would burn out {{in a few minutes}} of continuous operation, but not during the few seconds needed to start the engine. The starters were first installed by Cadillac on production models in 1912, with the same system being adopted by Lanchester later that year. These starters also worked as generators once the engine was running, a concept that is now being revived in hybrid vehicles.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|E
50|$|Steam feed {{is taken}} {{from the bottom of}} the boiler and {{directly}} to the valve chest housing the semi-rotative valve. This consists of a brass rod, cross drilled with two holes at right angles to each other, a small distance apart. The outside end of the rod has a <b>crank,</b> linked <b>to</b> a <b>crank</b> on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> crankshaft, so that it rocks back and forth by about 90 degrees. This causes the two holes to alternately line up with the steam and exhaust passages.|$|R
50|$|Steam-powered and {{electric}} cars outsold gasoline-powered ones in many US states {{prior to the}} invention of the electric starter, since internal combustion cars relied on a hand <b>crank</b> <b>to</b> start <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> which was difficult and occasionally dangerous to use, as improper cranking could cause a backfire capable of breaking the arm of the operator. Electric cars were popular to some extent, but had a short range, and could not be charged on the road if the batteries ran low.|$|R

Some of the fire department members restored one Metro for the District and the District gave the other one to the department, which used it for rescue for quiet a few years.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{remedy for}} a flooded carbureted engine is to steadily hold the throttle full open (full power position) while continuing <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This permits the maximum flow of air through the engine, flushing the overly rich fuel mixture {{out of the}} exhaust. If the exhaust system is hot enough to autoignite, an after-fire may result; {{this can be seen}} as a flame discharging through the exhaust system. On a fuel-injected engine, ignoring the throttle (no fuel) while starting permits electronic logic systems to produce the correct fuel mixture, often based on exhaust gases. Some fuel injection computers interpret 'pumping' the throttle to indicate a flooded engine, and alter the fuel-air mixture accordingly. In a carbureted engine equipped with an accelerator pump (which advances fuel flow to match air ingestion under rapid throttle acceleration), 'pumping' the throttle will force excess fuel into the engine, further flooding it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{automobile}} sector requires continuous {{progress in}} the development of ‘Starter Motor ’ by innovative approaches, although significant progresses were made in the past. Development of Starter Motor has made it possible to start the engine by electrical means instead of doing it manually. The outstanding features of this motor are they can produce the maximum starting torque <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> In this case, we use electrical energy and convert it to mechanical energy in order to start the engine in motor vehicles. As the starter motor is mounted near the engine; vibrational disturbances produced due to either uneven road conditions or engine vibrations or both hampering the performance of starter motor which may result in breaking of component of motors. Vehicle will experience vibrations whose values are un-predictable at certain point of time, causing random excitation and random vibrations. Aim of the paper is to perform analytical formulation for the Power Spectral Density function of Starter Motor by treating it as a cantilever beam and to find its response to random vibrations by using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) ...|$|E
40|$|Engine {{stop-start}} {{control is}} considered {{as the key}} technology for micro/mild hybridisation of vehicles and machines. To utilize this concept, especially for construction machines, the engine is desired to be started {{in such a way}} that the operator discomfort can be minimized. To address this issue, this paper aims to develop a simple powertrain modelling approach for engine stop-start dynamic analysis and an advanced engine start control scheme newly applicable for micro/mild hybrid construction machines. First, a powertrain model of a generic construction machine is mathematically developed in a general form which allows to investigate the transient responses of the system during the engine cranking process. Second, a simple parameterisation procedure with a minimum set of data required to characterise the dynamic model is presented. Third, a model- based adaptive controller is designed for the starter <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> quickly and smoothly without the need of fuel injection while the critical problems of machine noise, vibration and harshness can be eliminated. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed modelling and control approaches have been validated through numerical simulations. The results imply that with the limited data set for training, the developed model works better than a high fidelity model built in AMESim while the adaptive controller can guarantee the desired cranking performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in the use of ethanol as a future fuel for spark ignition engines. The finite availability of oil coupled with concerns about global warming and CO 2 emissions has led to an increase in the use of ethanol which is produced from biomass. Generally ethanol is blended with gasoline to make an automotive fuel with the most common blend being E 85 (85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline by volume), which is used in Sweden and in the USA. Unlike gasoline, ethanol is a single component fuel which has a low volatility especially at low temperatures which means that cold-starting a spark ignition engine with ethanol-gasoline fuel blends is more difficult. In Europe cold-starting emission testing must be completed at ambient temperature and - 7 °C. During cold-starting tests with ethanol-gasoline blends high fuelling levels are required to form a combustible mixture and start the engine which results in high hydrocarbon emissions. This study investigates the start performance of a range of ethanol-gasoline blends in a port fuel injected spark ignition engine. Tests are completed at both ambient temperature at -rc and the start performance is characterised by the fuelling levels required to start the engine, the emissions of hydrocarbons and the fuel unaccounted for during the test. The optimum first start fuelling level is highly dependent on the proportion of ethanol in the fuel. The lower volatility of the ethanol fuel blends meant that it is harder to form a combustible mixture without injecting high levels of fuel. The high fuel injection rates result in high levels of liquid fuel being inducted into the cylinder which causes high HC emissions and fuel unaccounted for during the start. Under ambient temperature starts E 10 and E 25 offer start performance benefits over gasoline, whilst E 50 and in some aspects E 75 are comparable to gasoline. E 85 fuel results in considerably higher emissions of HCs and fuel unaccounted for than gasoline during ambient temperature starts. At -rc the start performance with ethanol suffers compared to gasoline. When using E 10 and E 25 the start performance is comparable to gasoline, but with E 50 and the higher proportion ethanol fuel blends the start performance becomes far poorer. With E 85 the mass of fuel emitted from the engine as un-burnt HCs during a -rc start is seven times the quantity with gasoline. Hardware modifications were made to the engine {{in order to try to}} improve the start performance of -rc E 85 starts. Of the modifications tested heating the fuel within the fuel rail produced the biggest start improvement followed by heating the intake air. An extended cranking period prior to the start of the test only produced a small improvement in start performance and is not worthwhile compared to the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> With both fuel rail and intake air heating the start fuelling level can be 40. 5 % below the baseline E 85 level and peak HC emissions are reduced by 30. 5 %. The low volatility of E 85 meant that even when incorporating the hardware modifications, the start performance of the engine is still not comparable to the standard engine running on gasoline due to high emissions of HCs. When cold-starting, especially at low temperatures, the use of high proportion ethanol-gasoline fuel blends is not suitable if low emissions of HCs are a priority. Longer duration tests were also completed with different ethanol-gasoline fuel blends in order to investigate their influence on engine warm-up characteristics. Larger proportions of ethanol within the fuel resulted in higher engine work output and lower heat rejection to the coolant and oil. With E 100 it takes 7. 2 % longer for the thermostat to open compared to gasoline. The warm-up tests also showed that the exhaust gas temperature is lower with ethanol in the fuel, which will result in a longer period before the catalyst lights-off. A higher proportion of ethanol in the fuel results in lower NOx emissions due to reduced peak temperatures within the engine. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Since the combustion occurs well before the exhaust port is uncovered, these engines are also considerably quieter (when unmuffled) than glow-plug engines of similar displacement.|$|R
