I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E

500|$|In Whitehead's view, {{there are}} a number of {{problems}} with this notion of [...] "irreducible brute matter." [...] First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change. [...] By thinking of any material <b>thing</b> (<b>like</b> a rock, or a person) as being fundamentally the same thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its [...] "nature", scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same.

500|$|A Rutgers University study, {{published}} in 2011, {{was the first}} to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain, and supports the possibility of a distinct G-spot. When the research team asked several women to stimulate themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine, brain scans showed stimulating the clitoris, vagina and cervix lit up distinct areas of the women's sensory cortex, which means the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall – where the G-spot is reported to be. [...] "I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing," [...] stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings.

500|$|... "Dancehall Queen" [...] {{was written}} by Klas Åhlund, who {{produced}} the song with Diplo. The piece is a dancehall song, with influences of reggae. The song incorporates 1980s dancehall synths and subwoofer wobbles. Nate Chinen of The New York Times called the song [...] "an ode to 1990s Euro-dub". Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound called it a [...] "modern equivalent" [...] of 10cc's [...] "Dreadlock Holiday". The song utilizes electrified Caribbean sounds, influenced by Ace of Base. According to Ben Norman of About.com, Robyn [...] "raggas her way through a laid back and bouncy electronic atmosphere". The chorus features Robyn singing [...] "I still run this <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> a dancehall queen/I really don't want no hassle."

Both Demdike and Chattox were by then blind and in their eighties, and both provided Nowell with damaging confessions. Demdike claimed that she had given her soul to the Devil 20 years previously, and Chattox that she had given her soul to [...] "a <b>Thing</b> <b>like</b> a Christian man", on his promise that [...] "she would not lack anything and would get any revenge she desired".

Margaret Crooke, another witness seen by Nowell that day, claimed that her brother had fallen sick and died after having had a disagreement with Redferne, and that he had frequently blamed her for his illness Based on the evidence and confessions he had obtained, Nowell committed Demdike, Chattox, Anne Redferne and Alizon Device to Lancaster Gaol, to be tried for maleficium – causing harm by witchcraft – at the next assizes.|$|E

500|$|Rasmussen's {{first task}} was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's {{drumming}} were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars and a third for anything else. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield [...] "wasn't really interested in singing" [...] but instead [...] "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Jason Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound {{and the lack of}} discussion {{with the rest of the}} team. Newsted had a different experience with his previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, describing their style as [...] "basically everybody playing the same <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> a sonic wall". He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with only the assistant engineer present. Newsted noted that his parts were at the same audio frequency as Hetfield's guitar parts, and this created a [...] " [...] for the same frequency". Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the misrepresentation of bass of the record.|$|E
500|$|In Waters' absence, Gilmour {{had been}} {{recruiting}} musicians {{for a new}} project. Some months previously, keyboard player Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression for what later became [...] "Learning to Fly", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role {{on the development of}} his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was [...] "far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as [...] "mucking about with a lot of demos". At this stage, there was no firm commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the new material might end up on a third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music [...] "doesn't sound a fucking <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> Pink Floyd". Gilmour later admitted that the new project was difficult without Waters. [...] Gilmour had experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who would be credited as co-writer of [...] "Learning to Fly" [...] and [...] "On the Turning Away". Instead of writing a concept album, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to turn the new material into a Pink Floyd project.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I {{knew that she was}} going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension and that was really fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, it was a lot of different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious <b>thing,</b> <b>like,</b> 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E
