40|$|Reading {{comprehension}} and three aspects of working memory—general, visuospatial and phonological—was assessed in 41 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> hearing loss: 23 with cochlear implants and 18 with hearing aids. Performance on these tests was compared {{between the two}} groups of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> hearing loss and also related to that of 55 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical hearing. All children were between 6 and 14 years of age. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> hearing aids performed significantly more poorly on the reading comprehension test than <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical hearing but this difference was not significant between <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cochlear implants and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical hearing.

40|$|Background/Aim. To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} abnormal Technetium Tc 99 m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (Tc 99 m DMSA) renal scintigraphy findings in <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> urinary tract infection (UTI), and to evaluate the difference between <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI without VUR. Methods. Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 170 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI, mean age 7. 07 years (1 month to 14 years, 137 were girls and 33 were boys). In 88 of <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> VUR was proved by micturating cystouretherography (MCU), while in 82 VUR could not be detected by MCU. VUR was graded in accordance with MCU recommended by the international study of VUR. In 13 of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>the</b> grade of VUR was grade I, in 30 was grade II, in 23 grade III, in 17 grade IV, while the grade V was in 5 of <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Findings of Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy were classified as: 1 - normal, 2 - probably normal, 3 - equivocal, 4 - probably abnormal, and 5 - abnormal. The degree {{of the significance of}} the difference of the findings was estimated using χ 2, taking p < 0. 01 as the limit of statistical significance. Results. Of the total number of 170 studied <b>children,</b> <b>the</b> abnormal findings were detected in 30 % (51 / 170), normal findings in 62 % (106 / 170), and equivocal in 8 % (13 / 170). In <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI and VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings was 49 % (43 / 88), of normal 43 % (38 / 88), and of equivocal findings 8 % (7 / 88). All <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade V had the abnormal findings (the incidence of the abnormal findings was 100 %). In <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade IV, the abnormal findings were 71 %. In <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade I, 77 % of the findings were normal, in <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade II, 53 % of the findings were normal and in <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade III, 30 % of the findings of renal scintigraphy were normal. In <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI without VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings was 10 % (8 / 82), of normal findings 83 % (68 / 82), and of equivocal findings 7 % (6 / 82). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly higher in <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (p < 0. 01). Also, the incidence of the abnormal findings was higher in <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grades IV and V than in <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> VUR grade I (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. DMSA renal scintigraphy in <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ITU revealed <b>the</b> abnormal findings in 30 % of the cases. The incidence of the abnormal findings was significantly higher when VUR was present, as well as if the grade of VUR was higher. Our results confirmed that Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy was a very important technique in the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ITU...|$|R

Aubry objected to the move {{on the grounds that}} it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence.

In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} a {{research}} of how much do the pedagogical workers at the primary school know about the problems connected to learning of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD. For <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD <b>the</b> most important things are the early diagnosis and the treatment that helps to improve functioning of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD and to prevent additional problems. Besides medical institutions, parents and social environment, also a school that a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD goes to, has a significant role. More and more people believe that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD should go the ordinary primary school, because they can there acquire “positive behaviour patterns” and imitate them. Besides they can improve their social and verbal deficits. This diploma thesis tries to solve the above presented dilemmas and to answer some other questions such as: Are teachers ready {{for the inclusion of}} <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD? How well do they know the characteristics of autism? Have they ever dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD at work? In the theoretical part of the diploma thesis I dealt with the general characteristics of autism, after school care education in the past and now and teaching <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD in Slovenia and abroad. Then I focused on the characteristics of teaching <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD and on the influence of the disorder on learning. I also exposed the approaches that are useful for effective teaching. I have described structural teaching or teaching based on TEACCH method {{which is one of the}} most acknowledged efficient methods used in schools. The empirical part deals with the results of the research that included 66 primary teachers. The research is about the qualification of the primary teachers for how to recognise and consider the learning characteristics of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD. To what extent do the primary teachers know the teaching methods associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD? What is the possibility for realization of the structural teaching elements? There aren’t many <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD included in the ordinary primary schools in Slovenia. According to the learning characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD, <b>the</b> use of the appropriate approaches and methods is obligatory. Still teachers know very little about these approaches and methods. They think that the reason for their insufficient knowledge, about the appropriate approaches and methods, is the lack of professional qualifications. They also noticed many difficulties concerning the organisation of the lessons in the way that would correspond to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD and <b>the</b> other learners. Usually <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD need to be treated individually through the whole teaching process, which, in large classes, according to the teachers’ opinion cannot be done. The structural teaching approach is designed in a way, that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD develop independence, know what needs to be done and what follows next. Usage of the structural teaching can make the process of teaching <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD easier for the teacher, enables current work in the classroom and by the same time encourages <b>the</b> <b>child’s</b> independence, interest and strengthen his attention. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Problems with subject-verb {{agreement}} and phonological (processing) skills {{have been reported}} to occur in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> specific language impairment (SLI) and in those with developmental dyslexia, but only a few studies have compared such problems in these two groups. Previous studies have claimed a causal relationship between phonological processing deficits and morphosyntactic problems. Aims: The following questions were addressed in this study: (1) Are <b>children</b> <b>with</b> developmental dyslexia and SLI comparable in the level of sensitivity to subject-verb agreement, phonological awareness, and non-word repetition? (2) Are <b>children</b> <b>with</b> developmental dyslexia and SLI comparable in their performance profiles on tasks tapping subject-verb agreement, phonological awareness, and non-word repetition? (3) Are deficits in phonological processing skills related to morphosyntactic deficits? Methods & Procedures: Forty-five children (mean age= 8; 6 years) with developmental dyslexia, SLI and typically developing <b>children</b> participated. <b>The</b> sensitivity to subject-verb agreement, phonological awareness, and non-word repetition was measured. Outcomes & Results: Both <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> dyslexia and with SLI made more errors than <b>the</b> control <b>children</b> on <b>the</b> subject-verb agreement task, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> dyslexia scoring significantly better than <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI and dyslexia both performed more poorly on the phoneme-deletion task than the control group. Both clinical groups performed more poorly on the non-word repetition task than <b>the</b> control <b>children,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> dyslexia outperforming <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI. In all three tasks differences in performance profiles were found between <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> developmental dyslexia and SLI.

Conclusions: The results show similarities between <b>the</b> performances of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI and dyslexia on tasks tapping subject-verb agreement, phonological awareness, and non- word repetition: they scored more poorly than typically developing children. Qualitative analyses revealed, however, differences in the error patterns on all three tasks.

Priyavrata set off to the cremation grounds with the corpse of his son. On his way, he saw a celestial woman dressed in white silk and jewels, riding in a heavenly chariot. She declared to Priyavrata that she was Devasena, the daughter of Brahma and wife of Skanda.
