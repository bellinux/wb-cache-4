5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E
25|$|When Tekeli {{became aware}} of the escape, there was little left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{remaining}} 12 thousand Cossacks. The Sich was razed to the ground. The Cossacks were disarmed in the mostly bloodless operation while their treasury and archives were confiscated. Petro Kalnyshevsky was arrested and exiled to the Solovki, where he lived in confinement to 112 years of age. Most upper level Cossack Council members, such as Pavlo Holovaty and Ivan Hloba, were repressed and exiled as well, although lower level commanders and rank and file Cossacks were allowed to join the Russian hussar and dragoon regiments.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, Borges {{gained an}} {{editorial}} appointment at the literary supplement {{of the newspaper}} Crítica, where he first published the pieces collected as Historia universal de la infamia (A Universal History of Infamy) in 1935. The book includes two types of writing: the first lies somewhere between non-fictional essays and short stories, using fictional techniques to tell essentially true stories. The second consists of literary forgeries, which Borges initially passed off as translations of passages from famous but seldom-read works. In the following years, {{he served as a}} literary adviser for the publishing house Emecé Editores and from 1936 to 1939 wrote weekly columns for El Hogar. In 1938, Borges found work as first assistant at the Miguel Cané Municipal Library. It was in a working class area and there were so few books that cataloguing more than one hundred books per day, he was told, would leave little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other staff and so look bad. The task took him about an hour each day {{and the rest of his}} time he spent in the basement of the library, writing and translating.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of my life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{was also}} called upon on {{occasion}} {{to deal with}} Montgomery, with whom his professional relationship as {{deputy chief of staff}} was similar to that before the war when Montgomery was a brigade commander. On one occasion Morgan was summoned to Smith's office to find him white with rage at a telephone receiver. [...] "That's your bloody marshal {{on the other end of}} that," [...] Smith explained. [...] "I can't talk to him any more. Now you go on." [...] "As the campaign progressed," [...] Morgan later wrote, [...] "it became more difficult for us British at SHAEF to provide explanation, as we were continually called upon <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attitude and behaviour of the British authorities as exemplified by their chosen representative in the field." [...] Senior British officers at SHAEF, notably Morgan, Kenneth Strong and Jock Whiteley remained loyal to Eisenhower. This cast a pall over their careers after the war, when Montgomery became Chief of the Imperial General Staff.|$|E

500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} what they wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only {{a few months after the}} song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when I was living in a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just trying to figure out what to do with our lives." ...|$|E

There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> people in the United States, and that is to protect them...

500|$|Yankovic had {{previously}} heard [...] "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" [...] during 1994 {{and felt that}} it was [...] "one of two or three songs" [...] that could be potentially parodied. He noted that it [...] "would be really good <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next album", but felt that [...] "when the time is right, [...] think of something" [...] to write the parody about; he then returned his attention to writing original songs. After Scotti Brothers insisted on the writing of a new lead single, Yankovic very nearly had his label cancel the box set due to being unable to write under pressure. However, he soon returned to the idea of parodying [...] "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm". He decided to pair the song's music up with [...] "all the weird news stories that were going on" [...] and make each verse its own vignette. Yankovic also felt that by doing this and releasing it on the box set, {{he would be able to}} capitalize on the topicality of the issues.|$|E

500|$|Also at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson {{noted that}} there were still [...] "a couple pickup shoots" [...] <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film to [...] "clarify the logic". Further content for the film's {{training}} sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences [...] "loved [...] and wanted more". Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August. Dan Harmon wrote material for these additional scenes, which Derrickson described as [...] "script analysis and dialogue work", not enough to receive credit in the film. Feige said {{that in addition to}} any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to [...] "give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts." [...] Before the film's sets were demolished, [...] director Taika Waititi took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting Chris Hemsworth's Thor. The scene was for Ragnarok and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was [...] "kind of perfect" [...] to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to Doctor Strange as a mid-credits scene. A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential Doctor Strange sequel. Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective Doctor Strange scene, and [...] "kept throwing lines at" [...] Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film. Additional options Gunn filmed included: Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word excelsior meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being [...] "totally crazy"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, noting how the character [...] "HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!". Gunn felt the Garfield option was originally meant to appear in {{the final version of the}} film, but ended up being too long for the scene. By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.|$|E
500|$|The 2008 Chicago {{production}} was well received, and A Red Orchid Theatre again {{put on a}} production of the play in its 2009–2010 season. The Chicago {{production was}} directed by Steve Wilson, and ran from November 12, 2009 through January 3, 2010. The play's artistic director, Kirsten Fitzgerald spoke positively of rehearsals for the Chicago production: [...] "The energy that explodes into the theatre with {{the start of each}} rehearsal is palpable and impossible to deny, even from the office next door. I am ecstatic and so very grateful to bring last year's smash-hit to audiences old and new. The heart of last year's joyous and hilarious Chicago Premiere returns with plenty of surprises and new fun up our sleeves."

500|$|The storyline {{was created}} in spring 2009 during a story conference, where {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer, storyliner Dominic Treadwell-Collins, series consultant and lead writer Simon Ashdown, series producer Lorraine Newman, script producer Sharon Batten, and Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke were considering what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Christmas Day 2009 and 25th anniversary episodes. They discussed the character Archie Mitchell and how everyone hated him, and decided on a storyline with characters' hatred and anger towards Archie building up before Christmas, with a peak on Christmas Day when he is killed and another for the reveal on the 19 February 2010 anniversary. They decided to keep the killer's identity a secret within the small group and decided to reveal it during a live episode so that the secret could be kept {{for as long as}} possible, and managed the story on a need-to-know basis. The live episode's director, Clive Arnold, became the seventh person to discover the identity of the murderer. They went through the characters to decide who would create a [...] "shiver" [...] moment, and decided against Janine, even though she could have done it, because she has killed before. The killer was going to be Archie's wife Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), until producers discovered Windsor had planned to leave the show, so they decided on Stacey. Although scripts initially diverted attention away from Stacey, Santer realised that drawing attention away from her too much might make it more apparent.|$|E

500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have.
