25|$|Some {{classes of}} matroid have been defined from {{well-known}} families of graphs, by phrasing a characterization of these graphs in terms <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> more generally for matroids. These include the bipartite matroids, {{in which every}} circuit is even, and the Eulerian matroids, which can be partitioned into disjoint circuits. A graphic matroid is bipartite {{if and only if}} it comes from a bipartite graph and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if it comes from an Eulerian graph. Within the graphic matroids (and more generally within the binary matroids) these two classes are dual: a graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is Eulerian, and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if its dual matroid is bipartite.|$|E

He repeated his call to eliminate the inheritance tax and added that the state should [...] "aim for" [...] the elimination of corporate taxes. Bevin also called {{for the elimination of}} many of Kentucky's $10 billion in [...] "tax expenditures", which he called [...] "Frankfort-speak for loopholes". Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm {{not going to give you}} specifics at this point in time.

500|$|The episode {{as a whole}} {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that it [...] "stumbles {{as much as it}} shines, with two plot lines-worth of structure <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> and two that fall completely flat". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that [...] "while there were undeniably significant plot moments, the emotional depth was lacking", and Robert Canning of IGN said it was [...] "kind of boring" [...] and nothing happened to [...] "make it better than bland". AOLTV Crystal Bell found it frustrating, and said that the [...] "worst part" [...] was that it [...] "made me stop caring about these characters". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "a ton of it just didn't work". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson looked on the episode more favorably, however, and maintained that while it did not achieve the level of the previous two, it was a [...] "pretty strong outing nonetheless".|$|E

2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E

A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense?</b> Is that logic?" [...] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) effectively announced its opposition to Ellison's candidacy, issuing a press release saying that his statement [...] "raises serious concerns about whether Ellison faithfully could represent the Democratic Party's traditional support for a strong and secure Israel." [...] CNN also reported on his past support for anti-Semitic and radical organizations and individuals, particularly the Nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan, but noted they found no anti-Semitic writings or public statements by Ellison, and cited his public rejection of the group [...] "due to its propagation of bigoted and anti-Semitic ideas and statements". The New York Times reported that one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, Haim Saban, said in his 2016 foreign policy forum that Ellison is [...] "clearly an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person.” Reporters from the Washington Post, Slate and the Huffington Post have described this as part of a smear campaign against Ellison, and note that Ellison's rivals agreed that Saban should apologize for the comments. Schumer replied to critics, saying that Ellison has supported pro-Israeli policies within the Democratic Party, telling The Atlantic that [...] "while I disagree with some of [...] past positions, I saw him orchestrate one of the most pro-Israel platforms in decades by successfully persuading other skeptical committee members to adopt such a strong platform." ...|$|E
