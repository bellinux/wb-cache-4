In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of}} the ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E

25|$|Fragment A {{inhibits}} {{the synthesis}} of new proteins in the affected cell by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor EF-2—a protein <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to the translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome during protein translation, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.|$|E

25|$|Hemozoin {{formation}} {{is an excellent}} drug target, since {{it is a process}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to the survival of the malaria parasite and absent from the human host. The drug target hematin is host-derived and largely outside the genetic control of the parasite, which makes the development of drug resistance more difficult. Many clinically used drugs are thought to act by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin in the food vacuole. This prevents the detoxification of the heme released in this compartment, and kills the parasite.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is a complex}} dynamic natural gaseous system <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global {{atmosphere is}} air pollution, the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulates, or biological materials that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the natural environment or built environment. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized {{as a threat to}} human health {{as well as to the}} Earth's ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 is involved in regulation of biosynthesis of cardiolipin in mitochondria, and its overexpression in cultured cells resulted in increased cardiolipin synthase, activity. As cardiolipin is synthesized in the luminal side of inner mitochondrial membrane, a major fraction of this newly synthesized pool of cardiolipin has to be translocated from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane. PLSCR3 has been proposed {{to be involved in}} this translocation from the inner to the outer membrane <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for maintaining the mitochondrial architecture, mass, and transmembrane potential.|$|E

25|$|The {{catalytic}} {{domain of}} MMP-3 can be inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The n-terminal fragment of the TIMP binds {{in the active}} site cleft much like the peptide substrate would bind. The Cys1 residue of the TIMP chelates to the catalytic zinc and forms hydrogen bonds {{with one of the}} carboxylate oxygens of the catalytic glutamate residue (Glu202, see mechanism below). These interactions force the zinc-bound water molecule <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to the enzyme's function to leave the enzyme. The loss of the water molecule and the blocking of the active site by TIMP disable the enzyme.|$|E

The ratio of calcium to phosphorus {{for adult dogs}} should be 1:1. Compared to commercial dog food, the raw food diet allows dogs to work for their meal, ripping the meat off bones and then gnawing at the bones. In regards to dental health, bone to tooth gnawing allows a dog to rid their teeth of plaque buildup promoting good oral health. Skeptics argue however that this isn't healthy for dogs and it can cause dental fractures.|$|E
25|$|Yeast dynein {{can walk}} along microtubules without detaching, however in metazoans, cytoplasmic dynein must be {{activated}} by the binding of dynactin, another multisubunit protein <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for mitosis, and a cargo adaptor. The tri-complex, which includes dynein, dynactin and a cargo adaptor, is ultra-processive and can walk long distances without detaching {{in order to}} reach the cargo's intracellular destination. Cargo adaptors identified thus far include BicD2, Hook3, FIP3 and Spindly. The light intermediate chain, which {{is a member of the}} Ras superfamily, mediates the attachment of several cargo adaptors to the dynein motor. The other tail subunits may also help facilitate this interaction as evidenced in a low resolution structure of dynein-dynactin-BicD2.|$|E

25|$|Producers will {{typically}} {{continue to}} milk the cow until she is two {{months away from}} parturition then they will dry her off. Giving the cow a break during {{the final stages of}} pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her body condition to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased body condition in the cow means she will not be as productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the replacement herd. There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the dry period <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.|$|E
25|$|Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Dave Arneson {{described}} {{the origin of}} hit points in a 2002 interview. When Arneson was adapting the medieval wargame Chainmail (1971) to a fantasy setting, a process that with Gary Gygax would lead to Dungeons & Dragons, {{he saw that the}} emphasis of the gameplay was moving from large armies to small groups of heroes and eventually to the identification of one player and one character <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to role-playing as it was originally conceived. Players became attached to their heroes and did not want them to die every time they lost a die roll. Players were thus given multiple hit points which were incrementally decreased as they took damage. Arneson took the concept, along with armor class, from a set of a naval American Civil War game's rules.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{fundamental}} teachings of the Bahá'í Faith is {{that men and women}} are equal, and that equality of the sexes is a spiritual and moral standard <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of peace. Bahá'í teachings note the importance of implementing this principle in individual, family, and community life. Nevertheless, the Bahá'í notion of the full spiritual and social equality of the two sexes does not imply sameness, so that gender distinction and differentiation are observed in certain areas of life. For example, while women can and do serve in an extensive range of elected and appointed positions within the faith at both national and international levels, they are not permitted to serve as members of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing institution of the Bahá'í Faith. Furthermore, the education of daughters is held to be more important than, and therefore to take precedence over, that of sons.|$|E

25|$|Self-efficacy is a person's {{belief that}} he or she can {{accomplish}} a particular activity. It is a related concept introduced by Albert Bandura, and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale. It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and self-esteem, using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of their own health, they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific treatment regimen <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to maintaining their own health. Self-efficacy {{plays an important role in}} one's health because when people feel that they have self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} shown to inhibit steroid 11β-hydroxylase, an enzyme <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for the {{production}} of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. Because of this, glucocorticoid levels might be expected to be lowered, and hence, spironolactone might have some antiglucocorticoidic effects. In clinical practice, however, this has not been found to be the case; spironolactone has actually been found to increase cortisol levels, both with acute and chronic administration. Research has shown that this is due to antagonism of the MR, which suppresses negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis positively regulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn signals the adrenal glands, the major source of corticosteroid biosynthesis in the body, to increase production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Therefore, by antagonizing the MR, spironolactone causes an increase in ACTH secretion and by extension an indirect rise in cortisol levels. As such, any antiglucocorticoid activity of spironolactone via direct suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis (at the level of the adrenals) appears to be more than fully offset by its concurrent indirect stimulatory effects on glucocorticoid production.|$|E
