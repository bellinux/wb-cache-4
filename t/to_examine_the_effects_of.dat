In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding. Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker said in an {{interview}} with Louisiana Public Broadcasting that the MFP formula keeps districts from levying higher taxes because districts with high local taxes receive lower state funding payments. Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E

The earliest {{study was conducted}} in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe {{at the time of the}} study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{report about}} acid {{rain in the}} United States was from the chemical evidence from Hubbard Brook Valley. In 1972, {{a group of scientists}} including Gene Likens discovered the rain that was deposited at White Mountains of New Hampshire was acidic. The pH of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at Hubbard Brook. The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study followed up with a series of research that analyzed the environmental effects of acid rain. Acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils. The result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to increasing rate of soil weathering. Experimental research was done <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> increased acidity in stream on ecological species. In 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook, New Hampshire, and observed the change in species’ behaviors.

The sinking of Ostfriesland was accomplished by violating an agreement {{that would have allowed}} Navy engineers <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, [...] "No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them." [...] While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot. Rear Admiral William A. Moffett used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.|$|E
