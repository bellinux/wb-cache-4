5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, was caused by <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBy {{utilizing}} the self-designed test platform {{to carry out}} tests on <b>the</b> edge <b>ignition</b> time and center ignition time of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints to different fire-retardant degrees and analyzing the factors affecting <b>the</b> edge <b>ignition</b> time and center ignition time, this paper proposes the indicators {{for the assessment of}} fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints, i. e. <b>the</b> edge <b>ignition</b> time and <b>the</b> center <b>ignition</b> time. It is indicated by research results that the paint quality, coating process and fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints can be comprehensively assessed in terms of these two indicators; <b>the</b> edge <b>ignition</b> time can be used for auxiliary assessment of the quality situation of finishing fire-retardant paints, and <b>the</b> center <b>ignition</b> time can be used for assessment of the coating process of finishing fire-retardant paints...|$|R

5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi {{suffered}} 87 {{dead and}} 170 wounded; {{far more than}} Rossias 44 dead and 156 wounded.

Gromoboi was hit fifteen times on the starboard side of her hull and seven times on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{influence}} of <b>ignition</b> manner on micropyretic synthesis of low exothermic reaction with Ni+Al is numerically investigated in this study. <b>The</b> different <b>ignition</b> powers and ignition regions are chosen {{to illustrate the}} influences {{on the length of}} pre-heating zone and propagation velocity of the specimens. The numerical results indicate that a lower ignition power or igniting in the center region accelerates the heat loss. Thus, the length of pre-heating zone is increased and the average propagation velocity is correspondingly decreased. In the extreme case, the combustion front may not complete the propagation for the reaction with a lower pre-exponential factor. In addition, it is also shown that a higher <b>ignition</b> power consumes <b>the</b> additional <b>ignition</b> energy to ignite the specimens.

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. <b>The</b> <b>ignition</b> source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E

After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nanosecond}} pulsed non-equilibrium plasma discharges on ignition characteristics and low-temperature chemistry or LTC of DME/O 2 /Ar mixtures are numerically investigated in a plane-to-plane geometry at a reduced pressure of 76 Torr. Detailed numerical investigations of <b>the</b> two-stage <b>ignition</b> process in different temperature regimes of DME {{have been created}} through a high-fidelity one-dimensional, multi-timescale plasma-discharge model. Two different initial temperatures are set for comparison: 550 K, the negative temperature coefficient regime, where LTC plays a dominate role; 800 K, the intermediate temperature regime, where LTC normally does not play an important role. The results have shown that, in NTC regime, non-equilibrium plasma discharge improves <b>the</b> overall <b>ignition</b> delay time by 15 times with a significant improvement of approximately 250 times for <b>the</b> first-stage <b>ignition.</b> In Intermediate temperature regime, <b>the</b> two-stage <b>ignition</b> property is reactivated {{by the addition of}} plasma, and <b>the</b> overall <b>ignition</b> delay is shortened by approximately 75 times. This observation suggests that, in the intermediate temperature regime, the plasma discharges can not only enhance DME ignition characteristics but also alter the reaction pathways to a reactive LTC reaction pathway; therefore, <b>the</b> two-stage <b>ignition</b> behavior occurred again. Further investigation suggests that the plasma enhancement on ignition and LTC in the intermediate temperature regime is non-linear. As the accumulative energy input to the system increases, the enhancement from the non-equilibrium plasma discharge reaches a limit. Considering the total amount of heat release, the optimized voltage pulse number appears to be in the range of 35 - 40 to provide the most efficient enhancement for <b>the</b> overall <b>ignition</b> delay time...|$|R

5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering phase, a deflagration flame front is born, powered by carbon fusion.

5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black.

Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E

40|$|Recent papers [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5] have {{proposed}} two different systems to more efficiently and more rapidly burn the fuel in highly boosted, high compression ratio, directly injected internal combustion engines permitting multi-mode combustion operation.
