5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of <b>the</b> <b>AC</b> line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of <b>the</b> <b>AC</b> grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at <b>the</b> <b>AC</b> power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>AC</b> power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed and quality of <b>the</b> <b>AC</b> welding of aluminum, and also {{make it easier to}} strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system.

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to <b>the</b> <b>AC</b> grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E

5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace <b>the</b> <b>AC</b> line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged.

5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate.

Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy.
