5|$|In the semi-legendary {{period of}} the early republic, sources record Rome was twice {{attacked}} by Etruscan armies. About 509 BC war with Veii and Tarquinii {{was said to have}} been instigated by the recently overthrown king Tarquinius Superbus. Again in 508 BC Tarquin persuaded the king of Clusium, Lars Porsenna, <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on Rome, resulting in a siege of Rome and afterwards a peace treaty.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{recruited}} {{an army of}} 40,000, many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of {{them being}} Stefan Báthory. With them, they brought 500 cannons and other heavy siege equipment. The Moldavians, being fewer in number and seeing that the Hungarians were determined <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war,</b> started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages by cutting down trees and placing them on the roads.|$|E

5|$|The Palmerston {{government}} considered {{recognizing the}} Confederacy {{as an independent}} nation. Seward was willing <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against Britain if it did, and drafted a strong letter for the American Minister in London, Charles Francis Adams, to read to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell. Seward submitted it to Lincoln, who, realizing that the Union was {{in no position to}} battle both the South and Britain, toned it down considerably, and made it merely a memorandum for Adams's guidance.|$|E
5|$|Under Guangwu's {{rule the}} Han Empire was restored. Guangwu made Luoyang his capital in 25 AD, and by 27 AD his {{officers}} Deng Yu and Feng Yi had forced the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed their leaders for treason. From 26 until 36 AD, Emperor Guangwu had <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against other regional warlords who claimed {{the title of}} emperor; when these warlords were defeated, China reunified under the Han.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war).</b> Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E

50|$|Another proposal, {{according}} to the lexicographer Eric Partridge, is that the term was popularized by the Australian and New Zealand troops from about 1916 arriving at the front during World War I.

5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tenth century, the East Anglian Danes came under {{increasing}} pressure from Edward the Elder, king of Wessex. In 902 Edward's cousin Æthelwold ætheling, {{who had been}} driven into exile after an unsuccessful bid for the throne, arrived in Essex after a stay in Northumbria. He was apparently accepted as king by {{some or all of}} the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on Edward. This ended in disaster, with the death of Æthelwold and of Eohric of East Anglia in a battle in the Fens.|$|E
5|$|Mary strived {{for peace}} in the Netherlands. Charles paid no {{attention}} to the problems she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.|$|E
50|$|Yet Hsinbyushin's {{penchant for}} unmitigated warfare {{everywhere}} had a heavy {{cost to the}} kingdom.

He did learn from the mistake. With the Chinese keeping a heavy Chinese military lineup in the China-Burma border for about one decade <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> another <b>war,</b> he curbed his ambitions elsewhere even though it provided the Siamese much valuable time to consolidate their gains.|$|R

50|$|Gian Dinh, victorious, {{would like}} <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>wars</b> further north, right into Thăng Long, the capital. But Dang Tat, his lieutenant, stopped him and advised him not to, judging that his army is still small, ill-organized {{and does not}} have enough weaponry, or supply for a long war. Another {{advocate}} with him, Nguyễn Cảnh Chân, a former minor general under the Tran, also pleaded not <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> a bigger <b>war</b> with the Ming who at that time still control most of the territories. However, Gian Dinh, not taking any advice, is riding on his pride. He soon has his 2 best lieutenants both Nguyễn Cảnh Chân and Dang Tat arrested and killed, causing a dissension in his army and revolt.|$|R
5|$|Nine years later, he {{defeated}} {{and killed}} Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald, at the Battle of Maserfield; {{from this point}} he {{was probably the most}} powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, laying the foundations for the Mercian supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. He repeatedly defeated the East Angles and drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against the Bernicians of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered a crushing defeat by Oswald's successor and brother Oswiu, and was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed {{in the course of a}} final campaign against the Bernicians.|$|E
5|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is a 1999 American adult {{animated}} {{musical comedy}} film {{based on the}} Comedy Central animated television series South Park. The film was directed by series creator Trey Parker and stars the regular television cast of Parker, Matt Stone, Mary Kay Bergman, and Isaac Hayes, with guest performances by George Clooney, Eric Idle and Mike Judge. The film follows the four boys Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick as they sneak into an R-rated film featuring Canadian actors Terrance and Phillip and begin cursing incessantly. Eventually, their mothers pressure the United States <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against Canada for allegedly corrupting their children.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious state, however, {{in the two}} civil wars that were caused by the clash between generals Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla starting from 88 BC. In the Battle of the Colline Gate at the very door {{of the city of}} Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against one another that was {{to pave the way for}} the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the Roman Empire.|$|E
50|$|IP privateering resembles an {{historic}} method of <b>waging</b> <b>war</b> so effective {{that it had}} to be abolished by treaty, the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law (1856). “Privateering,” as it was called, was effective and cheap - the privateer’s actions cost the sponsoring government nothing. Privateering, like the creation of corporations, allowed governments to pursue policy objectives without any impact on the treasury. In short, classical privateering removed most obstacles <b>to</b> <b>waging</b> <b>war,</b> save for the opponent’s ability to retaliate. IP privateering similarly has the opponent’s ability to retaliate as its greatest obstacle, hence the importance of stealth to the sponsor.|$|R
50|$|When Prithviraja {{became an}} adult, many princesses {{expressed}} {{their desire to}} marry him. His good fortune also presented him with many opportunities <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>wars.</b> When Vigraharaja's son Nagarjuna conquered Gudapura, Prithviraja led an army against him and besieged the Gudapura fort. Nagarjuna relinquished the duty of a warrior, and fled from the fort. Prithviraja killed his warriors and captured the fort. He brought Nagarjuna's wife and mother to Ajmer, and placed the heads of his enemies on the Ajmer fort's battlements.|$|R

With the combined power of his past lives, Aang quickly overwhelms Ozai but refuses to kill him. After subduing Ozai, Aang finally understands the lion-turtle's meaning and uses energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, removing his ability <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> while Sozin's Comet vanishes beyond the horizon.

A final scene depicts the main cast gathered in Iroh's new tea shop, while Aang and Katara begin a romantic relationship.|$|E
5|$|Although the Byzantine–Bulgarian {{conflict}} {{that began in}} 913 was provoked by the Byzantines, it was the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893–927) who was seeking pretext <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> and fulfil his ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself and to assume the throne of Constantinople. Unable to confront the Bulgarians, the Byzantines reluctantly recognized Simeon I as Emperor of Bulgaria (in Bulgarian, Tsar) as early as July 913 but the decision was revoked after a palace coup in Constantinople in 914. Three years later, in 917, the main Byzantine forces were routed in the Battle of Achelous and the Bulgarians took the military initiative. In the four year that followed they launched a number of successful campaigns, reaching the walls of Constantinople and the Isthmus of Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{perceived}} the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639. Charles {{did not seek}} subsidies from the English Parliament <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war,</b> but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to Berwick-upon-Tweed, {{on the border of}} Scotland. Charles's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.|$|E

5|$|In 1777, the Revolutionary War {{intensified}} in Kentucky. British {{lieutenant governor}} Henry Hamilton armed his Indian allies from his headquarters at Fort Detroit, encouraging them <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on the Kentucky settlers {{in hopes of}} reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest or {{for the defense of}} Kentucky, which was left entirely to the local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders as a leader in the Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for a long-distance strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|In December 1829, Rosas became {{governor}} of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by state terrorism. In 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive Mazorca, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and his regime became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious {{stage in the}} two civil wars or marches upon Rome by the consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla {{at the beginning of}} 82 BC. In the Battle of the Colline Gate at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Roman senate and its Samnite allies. Whatever the merits of his grievances against those in power of the state, his actions marked a watershed of the willingness of Roman troops <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> <b>war</b> against one another that was {{to pave the way for}} the wars of the triumvirate, the overthrowing of the Senate as the de facto head of the Roman state, and the eventual endemic usurpation of power by contenders for the emperor-ship in the later Empire.|$|E

Ivan defeated and annexed the Khanate of Kazan {{on the middle}} Volga in 1552 and later the Astrakhan Khanate, where the Volga meets the Caspian Sea.
