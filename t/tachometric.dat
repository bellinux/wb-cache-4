5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of <b>tachometric</b> bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF was working on the Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to obtain}} the Norden, the RAF {{continued}} development of their own designs. Having moved to night bombing, where visual accuracy was difficult under even the best conditions, they introduced the much simpler Mark XIV bomb sight. This was designed not for accuracy above all, but ease of use in operational conditions. In testing in 1944, it was found to offer a CEP of , about what the Norden was offering at that time. This led to a debate within the RAF whether {{to use their own}} <b>tachometric</b> design, the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight, or use the Mk. XIV on future bombers. The Mk. XIV ultimately served into the 1960s while the SABS was removed from service almost immediately after the war.|$|E
25|$|The Norden Mk. XV, {{known as}} the Norden M series in Army service, was a bombsight used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the United States Navy during World War II, and the United States Air Force in the Korean and the Vietnam Wars. It was the {{canonical}} <b>tachometric</b> design, a system that allowed it to directly measure the aircraft's ground speed and direction, which older bombsights could only measure inaccurately with lengthy in-flight procedures. The Norden further improved on older designs by using an analog computer that constantly calculated the bomb's impact point based on current flight conditions, and an autopilot that let it react quickly and accurately {{to changes in the}} wind or other effects.|$|E
50|$|By 1940 the RN was {{adding a}} Gyro Rate Unit (GRU) which fed bearing and {{elevation}} data to a Gyro Rate Unit Box computer (GRUB), which also received ranging data to then directly calculate target speed and direction, and this <b>tachometric</b> data was then fed {{directly to the}} HACS fire control computer, converting the HACS into a <b>tachometric</b> system.|$|E
50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a <b>tachometric</b> relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the <b>tachometric</b> relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the <b>tachometric</b> relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the <b>tachometric</b> relay.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "SABS", {{this was an}} {{advanced}} bombsight mainly used by 617 Squadron for precision raids. Like the American Norden bombsight it was a <b>tachometric</b> sight.|$|E
5000|$|All {{of these}} designs collectively {{became known as}} <b>tachometric</b> sights, [...] "tachometric" [...] {{referring}} to the timing mechanisms which counted the rotations of a screw or gear that ran at a specified speed.|$|E
5000|$|The term tachymetric should more {{properly}} be spelled as [...] "tachometric" [...] {{which comes from}} the Greek [...] "takhos" [...] = speed, and [...] "metric" [...] = measure, hence <b>tachometric,</b> to measure speed.|$|E
50|$|Injection systems use a {{computerised}} {{control system}} {{which is very}} similar to that used in petrol injection systems. In virtually all systems, the injection control system integrates the <b>tachometric</b> relay and closed loop feedback functions.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} <b>tachometric</b> AA fire control {{would be the}} USN Mk 37 system. The early RN High Angle Control System (HACS) I through IV and the early Fuze Keeping Clock (FKC) were {{examples}} of non-tachometric systems.|$|E
50|$|The Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight, or SABS, was a Royal Air Force bombsight used {{in small}} numbers during World War II. The system worked along similar <b>tachometric</b> {{principles}} {{as the more}} famous Norden bombsight, but was somewhat simpler, lacking the Norden's autopilot feature.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The Norden M-1 is the {{canonical}} <b>tachometric</b> bombsight. The bombsight proper {{is at the}} top of the image, mounted on top of the autopilot system at the bottom. The bombsight is slightly rotated to the right; in action the autopilot would turn the aircraft to reduce this angle back to zero.|$|E
50|$|The ball-and-disk {{integrator}} is a {{key component}} of many advanced mechanical computers. Through simple mechanical means, it performs continual integration of the value of an input. Typical uses were the measurement of area or volume of material in industrial settings, range-keeping systems on ships, and <b>tachometric</b> bombsights. The addition of the torque amplifier by Vannevar Bush led to the differential analysers of the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Type 285 radar was {{an early}} {{addition}} to the FKC system, being fitted on new destroyers from mid-1941 onward, and retrofitted to existing destroyers as time and opportunity permitted. Later variants increased the maximum target speed to 500 kn, and were combined with Gyro Rate Units (GRU) which gave <b>tachometric</b> capabilities to the system, and radar which greatly improved ranging and rate keeping accuracy.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} to measuring {{the wind had}} two significant advantages. One was that the measurement was taken while on the {{approach to}} the target, which eliminated any problems with the winds changing after the measurement. Another advantage, perhaps more important, was that the measurement was made simply by aligning a sight on an object on the ground though a small telescope or reflector sight. All of the complicated calculations and setup of the vector designs were eliminated. These <b>tachometric</b> or synchronous bombsights were an area of considerable research during the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{their first}} {{application}} prior to World War I, bombsights have gone though several major revisions. The earliest systems were iron sights that were pre-set {{to an estimated}} fall angle. In some cases these consisted of {{nothing more than a}} series of nails hammered into a convenient spar, lines drawn on the aircraft, or visual alignments of certain parts of the structure. These were replaced by the earliest custom-designed systems, normally iron sights that could be set based on the aircraft's airspeed and altitude. These early systems were replaced by the vector bombsights, which added the ability to measure and adjust for winds. Vector bombsights were useful for altitudes up to about 3,000 m and speeds up to about 300 km/h. Starting in the 1930s, mechanical computers with the performance needed to [...] "solve" [...] the equations of motion were incorporated into the new <b>tachometric</b> bombsights, the most famous being the Norden. Later in World War II, <b>tachometric</b> bombsights were often combined with radar systems to allow accurate bombing through clouds or at night. When post-war studies demonstrated that bomb accuracy was roughly equal when optically or radar guided, optical bombsights were generally removed and the role passed to dedicated radar bombsights. Finally, especially from the 1960s on, fully computerized bombsights were introduced, which combined the bombing with long-range navigation and mapping.|$|E
50|$|The Mk. XIV {{was a major}} advance {{over the}} Mk. IX, but service entry was slow. It was not until January 1942 that it was given priority. This was aided by Sperry Gyroscope, who re-designed the system to U.S. {{production}} methods. They sub-contracted construction to A.C. Spark Plug who built tens of thousands as the Sperry T-1. It did not offer the level of accuracy of <b>tachometric</b> bombsights like the Norden, but for night area bombing from medium altitude as practiced by RAF Bomber Command {{this was not an}} issue. The Mk. XIV remained in RAF use until 1965.|$|E
50|$|The {{strategic}} bombing {{role was}} following an evolution {{over time to}} ever-higher, ever-faster, ever-longer-ranged missions with ever-more-powerful weapons. Although the <b>tachometric</b> bombsights provided most of the features needed for accurate bombing, they were complex, slow, and limited to straight-line and level attacks. In 1946 the US Army Air Force asked the Army Air Forces Scientific Advisory Group to study the problem of bombing from jet aircraft that would soon be entering service. They concluded that at speeds over 1,000 knots, optical systems would be useless - the visual range to the target would be less than the range of a bomb being dropped at high altitudes and speeds.|$|E
5000|$|Norden's {{original}} design was a conventional system {{known as an}} [...] "equal distance sight" [...] that was attached to his gyroscopic stabilizer system. The Navy asked him to replace the bombsight with a <b>tachometric</b> design on the same stabilizer. He initially refused, but eventually took a sabbatical in Europe and returned with a workable design that was delivered for testing in 1931. The Norden bombsight demonstrated itself able to drop bombs within a few yards of its targets from altitudes between 4000 and 5000 ft. The Navy saw this {{as a way to}} attack ships from level bombers at altitudes outside the effective range of the ship-borne anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
50|$|The Norden Mk. XV, {{known as}} the Norden M series in Army service, was a bombsight used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the United States Navy during World War II, and the United States Air Force in the Korean and the Vietnam Wars.

50|$|The first {{calculated}} the angular rate of motion of a stationary {{location on the}} ground, and output, which provided the ground speed of the aircraft, this to a reflector sight mounted {{on the left side}} of the bombsight. The key component of this system, and other <b>tachometric</b> designs, was the ball-and-disk integrator. This is a form of continuously variable transmission that allowed an output shaft to be driven at a controlled speed relative to an input. The input was normally attached to some sort of value to be measured, say the height of water in a sluice, and as it moved, the output disk sped or slowed. The total number of turns of the output shaft was an integrated version of the input.|$|E
50|$|Unable {{to obtain}} the Norden, the RAF {{continued}} development of their own designs. Having moved to night bombing, where visual accuracy was difficult under even the best conditions, they introduced the much simpler Mark XIV bomb sight. This was designed not for accuracy above all, but ease of use in operational conditions. In testing in 1944, it was found to offer a CEP of 270 m, about what the Norden was offering at that time. This led to a debate within the RAF whether {{to use their own}} <b>tachometric</b> design, the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight, or use the Mk. XIV on future bombers. The Mk. XIV ultimately served into the 1960s while the SABS was removed from service almost immediately after the war.|$|E
50|$|The {{measurement}} of the wind speed is a more serious concern. Early navigation systems generally measured it using a dead reckoning procedure that compares measured movement over {{the ground with the}} calculated movement using the aircraft instruments. The Federal Aviation Administration's FAR Part 63 suggests 5 to 10% accuracy of these calculations, the US Air Force's AFM 51-40 gives 10%, and the US Navy's H.O. 216 at a fixed 20 miles or greater. Compounding this inaccuracy is that it is made using the instrument's airspeed indication, and as the airspeed in this example is about 10 times that of the wind speed, its 5% error can lead to great inaccuracies in wind speed calculations. Eliminating this error through the direct {{measurement of}} ground speed (instead of calculating it) was a major advance in the <b>tachometric</b> bombsights of the 1930s and 40s.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out.

50|$|The RN {{moved quickly}} to add true <b>tachometric</b> target motion {{prediction}} and radar ranging to the HACS by mid 1941. The RN was the first navy to adopt dedicated FC AA radars. However the system, in common with all WW2 era mechanical AA fire control system still had severe limitations as even the highly advanced USN Mk 37 system in 1944 needed an average of 1,000 rounds of 5-inch ammunition fired per kill. In 1940 the Gyro Rate Unit (GRU) {{was added to the}} HACS system, an analogue computer capable of directly calculating target speed and direction, converting the HACS into a tachymetric system. Also in 1940, radar ranging was added to the HACS. The GRU and its associated computer, the Gyro Rate Unit Box (GRUB) no longer assumed straight and level flying {{on the part of the}} target. GRU/GRUB could generate target speed and position data at angular rates of up to 6 degrees per second, which was sufficient to track a 360 knot crossing target at a range of 2000 yards.|$|E
50|$|Although the US put {{the most}} effort into {{development}} of the <b>tachometric</b> concept, they were also being studied elsewhere. In the UK, work on the Automatic Bomb Sight (ABS) had been carried on since the mid-1930s {{in an effort to}} replace the CSBS. However, the ABS did not include stabilization of the sighting system, nor the Norden's autopilot system. In testing the ABS proved to be too difficult to use, requiring long bomb runs to allow the computer time to solve the aim point. When RAF Bomber Command complained that even the CSBS had too long a run-in to the target, efforts to deploy the ABS ended. For their needs they developed a new vector bombsight, the Mk. XIV. The Mk. XIV featured a stabilizing platform and aiming computer, but worked more like the CSBS in overall functionality - the bomb aimer would set the computer to move the sighting system to the proper angle, but the bombsight did not track the target or attempt to correct the aircraft path. The advantage of this system was that it was dramatically faster to use, and could be used even while the aircraft was manoeuvring, only a few seconds of straight-line flying were needed before the drop. Facing a lack of production capability, Sperry was contracted to produce the Mk. XIV in the US, calling it the Sperry T-1.|$|E

40|$|Spectral {{vibration}} {{analysis using}} the Fourier transform {{is the most}} common technique for evaluating the mechanical condition of machinery working in stationary regimen. However, machinery operating in transient modes, such as variable speed equipment, generates spectra with distinct frequency content at each time, and the standard approach is not directly applicable for diagnostic. The "order tracking" technique is a suitable tool for analyzing variable speed machines. We have studied the computed order tracking (COT), and a new computed procedure is proposed for solving the indeterminate results generated by the traditional method at constant speed. The effect on the accuracy of the assumptions inherent in the COT was assessed using data from various simulations. The use of these simulations allowed us to determine the effect on the overall true accuracy of the method of different user-defined factors: the signal and <b>tachometric</b> pulse sampling frequency, the method of amplitude interpolation, and the number of <b>tachometric</b> pulses per revolution.
