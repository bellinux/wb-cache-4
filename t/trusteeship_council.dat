UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF.

25|$|As part {{of ongoing}} {{meetings}} in the United Nations <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council</b> on the Conditions in the Trust Territories, the Republic of Nauru expressed concern that its phosphate mining exportation would be depleted {{by the end of}} the century, endangering the future of the island. In 1961, Fraser Island was proposed by Australia as a location for the resettlement of the entire population of the Republic of Nauru. The timber industry on Fraser Island managed to ensure that resettlement on Fraser Island did not proceed. In 1964 in the 31st session of United Nations <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council</b> meetings it was concluded that Curtis Island could provide a more satisfactory resettlement for the population of Nauru. Nauru rejected the offer of moving the entire population to Curtis Island due to political independence considerations that Australia would not agree to. Although a resettlement never did occur, the Republic of Nauru went on to achieve independence on 31 January 1968.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council,</b> {{one of the}} {{principal}} organs of the United Nations, was established to help ensure that trust territories were administered {{in the best interests of}} their inhabitants and of international peace and security. The trust territories—most of them are former mandates of the League of Nations or territories taken from nations defeated at the end of World War II—have all now attained self-government or independence, either as separate nations or by joining neighbouring independent countries. The last was Palau, formerly part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which became a member state of the United Nations in December 1994.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{proposals}} pursuing an unrefined form {{of sovereign}} association {{emerged during the}} 1880s and 1920s, but failed to gain an immediate foothold. The current territorial Commonwealth status is the consequence of its architect's inability to implement his original vision. When first proposed by Resident Commissioner Antonio Fernós-Isern, the concept was akin {{to a form of}} sovereign free association such as the one found in the Commonwealth realms. In 1950, Fernós used his function as Resident Commissioner to influence a process held between March 30 and July 3, that ended with the approval of Public Law 600, which allowed Puerto Rico to draft its own Constitution and adopt a new political system. He expected that by adopting this law, the control that the United States retained would only be considered a form of trusteeship, with sovereignty being partially split between both sides due to voluntary relegation, in line with the United Nations <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council.</b> At the moment Fernós expected that the territorial clause would not apply after reclaiming sovereignty, {{due to the fact that}} the United States never incorporated Puerto Rico. During the original negotiation process in Congress, Fernós was aware that several key elements of his project were being removed, but opted to focus on its initial approval, believing that he would not be able to accomplish everything at once. Under these arguments, the adoption of Law 600 was approved on June 5, 1951. The name of Estado Libre Asociado (lit. [...] "Associated Free State") was adopted as the official Spanish name, while the official English name avoided naming any form of association or freedom, simply being called [...] "Commonwealth".|$|E

5000|$|Chapter XIII of the United Nations Charter {{deals with}} the UN <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council.</b> It {{guarantees}} {{each of the five}} permanent members of the UN Security Council a seat on the council (albeit without veto) as well as those administering trust countries, and as many other members elected by the UN General Assembly as may be necessary to have an equal number of trust-administering and non-trust-administering countries on the <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council.</b> The <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council</b> is required to make an annual report to the UNGA on each trust territory. With all territories having reached independence, the <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Council</b> is basically dormant today. There have been proposals to transform it into a <b>trusteeship</b> <b>council</b> of the global commons (i.e. the environment), although Kofi Annan recommended abolishing it altogether in his report, In Larger Freedom.|$|E
50|$|On 30 March 1985, the Stephens Island {{community}} elected 3 councillors {{to constitute}} an autonomous Stephen Island Council established under the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984. This Act conferred local government type powers and responsibilities upon Torres Strait Islander councils {{for the first}} time. The Aboriginal reserve on the island, held by the Queensland Government, was transferred on 21 October 1985 to the <b>trusteeship</b> of the <b>council</b> under a Deed of Grant in Trust. On 24 April 2002 the council’s name was changed from Stephen Island Council to Ugar Island Council.|$|R
50|$|Another victory {{claimed by}} Lawlor {{on behalf of}} the council was the 1992 {{prevention}} of commercial development proposals for Crown land on South Stradbroke Island, including a golf course by Christopher Skase. Several hundreds of hectares of land were rezoned for environmental use after a five-year council battle. The vacant Crown land on the island was declared an environmental park under joint <b>trusteeship</b> of the <b>council</b> and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Meanwhile, in 1991 council acquired 4ha of privately owned land near the southernmost tip of the island and had it rezoned to public open space.|$|R

None of the original plans or any of the original windmill machinery parts could be located at that time. Based on these findings the National Trust formed the opinion that the building should be preserved in its present form and not reconstructed to its windmill form.|$|R
