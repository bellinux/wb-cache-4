2500|$|Addams' {{cartoons}} regularly {{appeared in}} The New Yorker, {{and he also}} created a syndicated comic strip, Out of This World, which ran in 1956. There are many collections of his work, including Drawn and Quartered (1942) and Monster Rally (1950), the latter with a foreword by John O'Hara. Typical of Addams' work, one cartoon shows two men standing in a room labeled [...] "Patent Attorney". One is pointing a bizarre gun out the window <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and saying: [...] "Death ray, fiddlesticks! Why, it doesn't even slow them up!".|$|E
2500|$|The Hammond–Harwood House is a five-part {{brick house}} with a five-bay two-story central block, two-story end wings and one-story {{connecting}} hyphens on either side. The central block has a shallow hipped roof. The wings project <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> with three-sided hipped-roof bays. The hyphens are rendered as a blind arcade, with the central bay a door opening with a pediment above. [...] There is little decoration, with plain rubbed brick flat arches over the windows. Ornament is confined to the central bay, whose door [...] is framed by engaged Ionic columns and topped by a fanlight. [...] Above the door the second floor window is framed with a surround and entablature.|$|E

2500|$|Beacham {{outfitted}} his {{theater with}} innovative state-of-the art equipment from the Southern Theater Equipment Company of Atlanta. [...] The Beacham's box {{office in the}} lobby featured both an automatic admission ticket vending machine dispenser and ticket chopping machine. [...] A decorative marquee that was unique in Florida extended <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and featured an electric changeable sign that flashed the daily program. [...] Two Powers 6B type [...] "E" [...] projectors were supplied by the N Power company of New York. [...] The Midas Gold film screen was made especially for the Beacham. A medium-sized pipe organ from the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Connecticut, was purchased and installed {{at a cost of}} $15,000. [...] The organ, Opus 1034 with 3 manuals in a center console, 24 ranks of pipes and 24 stops [...] was played by both Mr. Herman Stuart and Mrs. Roberta Branch Beacham, wife of Braxton Beacham Jr. to accompany silent films and vaudeville acts. [...] Typhoon cooling and ventilating equipment was installed in the theater. [...] The Beacham Building's construction featured numerous fireproofing and fire safety measures. [...] When the theater opened, the auditorium had an operating capacity of 1400.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, Hunt & Grey {{designed}} {{a home for}} Dr. Guy Cochran near Downtown Los Angeles that Gustav Stickley's The Craftsman magazine dubbed the [...] "very best" [...] of their work, with enormous windows [...] "looking out upon the terrace and garden, giv such a sense of {{relationship between the two}} that there is almost no feeling of being enclosed within walls." [...] The Craftsman referred to Hunt & Grey as [...] "pioneers {{in the development of the}} new American architecture," [...] which was [...] "but a series of individual plans adapted to the climatic conditions and to the needs of daily living" [...] and in harmony [...] "with the natural environment and contour of the landscape." [...] The house reflected Grey's vision of California bungalow architecture, which he described in 1907 as follows:"The best California bungalow schemes involve a garden or large outdoor living space, incorporated as an integral part of the plan. [...] By this we mean that the main rooms of the house are arranged to face this out-of-door living space ... It was once considered absurd to plan a house with the kitchen <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> but now not so in California ... the street side of [...] domicile is merely the side through which he enters." ...|$|E

25|$|At the {{entrance}} of {{each side of the}} building are semicircular landings equal in width to the steps thereby making the landings at the principal north and south entrance much larger. From each landing are straight sidewalks, first constructed in 1918, leading directly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> A fence constructed of steel pipes around 1915 lines the perimeter of the property. The fence includes turnstiles installed where {{the entrance}} sidewalks at the center of each side of the property. For greater accessibility, the west turnstile has been removed, and a larger gate has been installed on the south side.|$|R

[...] "It is a thick {{row of trees}} growing in the garden, and having the side <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> trimmed smooth and {{straight}} like a wall. The entrance through this range of trees, opposite the gateway where {{you go into the}} garden, looks like an archway in a green wall. You will see it before you as soon as you turn the corner of this hotel into the street that leads that way. You can walk straight on till you come to the place. There you will find the entrance to the garden. There is a very high iron palisade {{along the side of the}} garden <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> with the rows of trees which I have spoken of inside of it. There is a gateway through this palisade where you can go in. There are two soldiers there to guard the gateway." ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{this short}} dialogue, young Edwards stood, an {{attentive}} listener, holding {{in his hand}} a fishing-rod, {{the day and the}} season having tempted him also to desert the house for the pleasure of exercise in the air.

60|$|To {{have entered}} {{it would have}} been to have courted greater danger than we were already in. We decided to wait until the stress of blacks thinned, and {{for more than an hour}} we stood there while the sounds of battle raged upon the eastern side of the city and <b>the</b> {{population}} flew <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west. More and more numerous became the uniformed soldiers among the fleeing throng, until, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> last, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> was packed with them. It was no orderly retreat, but a rout, complete and terrible.|$|R

60|$|She sent a wail of reproach after him, {{and then}} {{continued}} toward South Hatboro'. As {{she passed the}} lodge at {{the gate of the}} Northwick avenue, where the sisters now lived, she noted that the shades were closely drawn. They were always drawn on the side <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> but Mrs. Munger thought it interesting that she had never noticed it before, and in the dearth of material she made the most of it, both for her own emotion, and for the sensation of others when she reached South Hatboro'.|$|E
60|$|After a time, {{they came}} to a long, {{straight}} street, which led across the city, through the centre of it, from the river to the Boulevards; and when they were about {{in the middle of this}} street, the attention of the children was attracted by a very long and gloomy-looking building, which formed one side of the street for a considerable distance before them. It had no windows <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> but only a range of square recesses in the walls, of the form of windows, but without any glass. Jennie asked Mr. George if it was the prison.|$|E
60|$|Here, all {{was almost}} total {{darkness}} until his eyes became {{accustomed to the}} interior, the darkness of which was slightly alleviated by the reflected light from a distant street flare which shone intermittently through the narrow windows fronting the thoroughfare. Finally, assured that the apartment was unoccupied, Tarzan sought for a stairway to the ground floor. This he found in a dark hallway upon which the room opened--a flight of narrow stone steps leading downward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Chance favored him so that he reached {{the shadows of the}} arcade without encountering any of the inmates of the house.|$|E

60|$|Murray {{was making}} a {{progress}} through the country, traveling in state with a great retinue, and was to pass through Linlithgow. There is a town of that name close by the palace. Hamilton provided himself with a room {{in one of the}} houses on the principal street, through which he knew that Murray must pass. He had a fleet horse ready for him at the back door. The front door was barricaded. There was a sort of balcony or gallery projecting <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> with a window in it. He stationed himself here, having carefully taken every precaution to prevent his being seen from the street, or overheard in his movements. Murray lodged in the town during the night, and Hamilton posted himself in his ambuscade the next morning, armed with a gun.|$|E

[...] "The rococo must have always had a sneaking charm for us, when we were pinning our faith to pointed arches; and yet I suppose we were perfectly sincere. Oh, look at that divinely ridiculous Madonna!" [...] They were now making {{their way out of the}} crooked footway behind their hotel <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> leading to the cathedral, and she pointed to the Blessed Virgin over the door of some religious house, her drapery billowing about her feet; her body twisting to show the sculptor's mastery of anatomy, and the halo held on her tossing head with the help of stout gilt rays. In fact, the Virgin's whole figure was gilded, and so was that of the child in her arms. [...] "Isn't she delightful?" ...|$|E
60|$|Markey signalled {{that he had}} heard, {{and those}} brown eyes under eyebrows meeting and forming one long, dark line, took his master in from head to heel. He had already nodded last night, when his wife had said the gov'nor would take it hard. Retiring to the back premises, he jerked his head <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and made a motion upward with his hand, by which Mrs. Markey, an astute woman, {{understood}} {{that she had to}} go out and shop because the gov'nor was dining in. When she had gone, Markey sat down opposite Betty, Gyp's old nurse. The stout woman was still crying in a quiet way. It gave him the fair hump, for he felt inclined to howl like a dog himself. After watching her broad, rosy, tearful face in silence for some minutes, he shook his head, and, with a gulp and a tremor of her comfortable body, Betty desisted. One paid attention to Markey.|$|E

[...] "Wait," [...] he cried, excitedly, [...] "I will go and see if I can find a place for you. Wait right here," [...] and off he ran <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> inn.|$|R
