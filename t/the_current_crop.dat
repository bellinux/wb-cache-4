25|$|Even {{excluding}} Sussex and London, South-east England {{has been}} one of the key areas of English folk music and collection. It had retained a strong tradition of wassailing, and seafaring songs were important in the coastal counties of Kent and Hampshire. Arguably the published collection of oral material was made in this area by John Broadwood, as Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex (1843). When the first revival was at its height in the first decade of the 20th century, George Gardiner and Alice Gillington both collected songs in Hampshire, Lucy Broadwood in Surrey, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, Alfred Williams in Oxfordshire and Berkshire and Cecil Sharp in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Kent. In the second folk revival the region contributed several figures, with probably the most important being Martin Carthy from Hertfordshire. The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the Oyster Band, formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. From <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crop</b> of young folk musicians probably the most prominent are Spiers and Boden from Oxfordshire and Chris Wood, born in Kent. The region is host to numerous folk clubs, and festivals, including the Oxford festival and Fairport’s Cropredy Convention in Oxfordshire and St Albans in Hertfordshire.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>current</b> study, however, we showed that co-cultivation with legumes increased cadmium (Cd) contamination in the adjacent crops. Both field and mesocosm experiments indicated that legumes increased Cd levels in edible parts and shoots of four neighboring crops and five maize varieties tested, regardless of the Cd levels in the soil. This enhanced Cd accumulation in crops was attributed to root interactions that alter the rhizosphere environment.

30|$|In Egypt, {{population}} growth and the horizontal expansion plans of the government increase the demand for irrigation water. A considerable increase in efficiency is required to make this additional required water available. Such an efficiency improvement will have important social {{as well as economic}} impacts, e.g. when changes in the cropping pattern are required (shift from crops with a high water demand to less sensitive crops (MWRI 2005). The Egyptian cropping pattern was mainly controlled by Egyptian government for a long period (1961 – 1986). Several studies, revealed the deviation of the prevailing cropping pattern from optimal one that could achieve economic efficiency in allocating resources and increasing agricultural production (Negm et al. 2006; Kuo 2001). Starting from 1987, an agricultural liberalization policy was implemented in Egypt.
