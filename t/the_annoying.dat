5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Jeuxvideo.com had high {{praise for the}} level design, graphics, and animations.

The magazine also liked how the game fit the Kirby universe, apart from its increased difficulty—Jeuxvideo.com occasionally had trouble hitting the slow-paced ball with precision.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} <b>the</b> <b>{{annoying}}</b> bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider {{it to be}} White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? {{to be the best}} answer, one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the other lines, can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the series had {{received}} attention of Fargo advertising agency H2M, who, in 2006, created its own “Talking Orange”, which is the spokesman for an ad campaign for the North Dakota Department of Transportation. Both of the two characters were two anthropomorphic oranges with ties to the Fargo-Moorhead area. Despite only slightly resembling the “Talking Orange”, <b>the</b> <b>Annoying</b> Orange was looked into by H2M’s attorneys as an intellectual property matter. Boedigheimer stated he had not watched the “Talking Orange” videos before he was told about the disagreement, also believing that the characters weren’t very similar. Boedigheimer and Grove were later sued by H2M in May 2013 for allegedly copying the character. No source has been released stating whether the case has been disclosed or is still going on.|$|E

25|$|The 1950-51 side under Freddie Brown...was full of inexperienced {{players and}} we paid the penalty.

Two Tests were lost by a very small margin and we won the last. In addition Denis Compton was a complete failure in the Tests, scoring only 53 runs in four matches.
