25|$|In January 1910 Griffith and Lee Dougherty {{with the}} rest of the Biograph acting company {{traveled}} to Los Angeles. While the purpose of the trip was to shoot Ramona in authentic locations, it was also to determine the suitability of the West Coast as a place for a permanent studio. The group set up a small facility at Washington Street and Grand Avenue (where the Los Angeles Convention Center now stands). After this, Griffith and his players decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further north to a small village they had heard about that was friendly and had beautiful floral scenery. They decided to travel there and fell in love with this little place called Hollywood. Biograph then made the first film ever in Hollywood called In Old California, a Latino melodrama about the early days of Mexico-owned California. Griffith and the Biograph troupe filmed other short movies at various locations, then traveled back to New York. After the East Coast film community heard about Hollywood, other companies began to migrate there. Biograph’s little film launched Hollywood as the future movie capital of the world. It opened a studio at Pico and Georgia streets in downtown Los Angeles in 1911, and sent a film crew to work there each year until 1916.|$|E
500|$|The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: [...] "Barton Fink sort of {{washed out}} our brain {{and we were}} able to go back and finish Miller's Crossing." [...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I felt I could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further than they expected." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed all of us that it was possible <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it {{in the way that they}} should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} March 2011, using digital cinematography. Wirkola said, [...] "Hopefully – {{you can see}} what I’m inspired by: Raimi and Jackson. Actually I’m a big fan of [...] Spielberg and the way he shoots action scenes. I think in a lot of modern action movies, it’s hard to see what’s going on. Shaky cam… Hopefully what we strived for was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> retro in how you shoot action scenes." [...] The film was shot in 3-D and its real 3D shots were done by lead stereographer Florian Maier and his team from Stereotec. Wirkola said: [...] "We shot half of it in real 3D and the other half was post converted. Actually the 3D thing wasn’t there in the beginning. It was something the studio suggested later on. We embraced it and I think it actually really helps in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months. A 12-minute B-roll footage was later released on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|When conceiving {{ideas for}} The Last of Us, Druckmann used {{a concept that}} he created {{as a student at}} Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the {{gameplay}} of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based The Last of Us on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl Ellie. Druckmann wrote The Last of Us with the intention of having the story [...] "rooted firmly within reality", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous [...] "light and loose" [...] feeling. [...] "It needed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> darker [...] to explore a sadder theme," [...] he explained. Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to [...] "talk to [...] in the same language". The game was released on June 14, 2013 to critical acclaim, with particular praise directed towards Druckmann's work on the story. He earned numerous awards for his work on the game, including a BAFTA, a DICE Award, a Game Developers Choice Award, a Golden Joystick Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award.|$|E

60|$|If you {{had seen}} me and Buck {{the next night}} you'd have had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bum hotel over near the West Side ferry landings. We was in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> back room, and I was filling up a gross of six-ounce bottles with hydrant water colored red with aniline and flavored with cinnamon. Buck was smoking, contented, and he wore a decent brown derby in place of his silk hat.|$|R

60|$|At last he rose <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> smiling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{as if in}} {{apology for}} his dark mood. He {{looked down at her}} slender body robed so daintily in gray and white; she made him feel coarse and rough.|$|R
