5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E

5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In his (1991) novel Roman Blood, Steven Saylor renders a fictionalized, yet informed, {{rendition}} {{of how the}} Roman punishment poena cullei might occur.

5|$|On June 29 the FIA World Motorsport Council {{found the}} teams guilty {{on the first}} two counts, that is, of not being in {{possession}} of suitable tyres for the event, but with strong mitigating circumstances, and that of wrongfully refusing to allow their cars to start the race.

5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> for {{parricide}} was basically made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead.

5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} of his success, along with {{questions}} about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.|$|E

5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops <b>the</b> <b>punishment.</b> Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E
