5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; <b>then,</b> <b>perhaps</b> seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

25|$|In {{this way}} the Antonine decree would indeed have greatly {{increased}} the imperial tax base, primarily by obliging Roman citizens (by <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> 20-30% of the population) to pay direct taxes: the poll tax and, {{in the case of}} owners of Italian land and Roman coloniae, the land tax.|$|E

25|$|Philosophers, such as Wittgenstein, take a {{view that}} is {{considered}} anti-realist and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, Charles Taylor contends that the real is whatever will not go away. If we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> God is as real as anything else.|$|E
25|$|Borges imagines a Tlönite {{working his}} way out of the problem of solipsism by {{reasoning}} that if all people are actually aspects of one being, <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> the universe is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining. This is, effectively, a near-reconstruction of the Berkeleyan God: perhaps not omnipresent, but bringing together all perceptions that do, indeed, occur.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, The New York Times {{reported}} that Scott and his brother, director Tony Scott, {{were working on}} a Blade Runner prequel, Purefold, set in 2019.

Due to rights problems, the series was not to be linked too closely to the characters or events of the 1982 film. On February 7, 2010, it was announced that production on Purefold had ceased, due to funding problems.|$|E

25|$|In September 1905 Blampied {{transferred}} from the Lambeth School of Art to the London County Council School of Photo-engraving and Lithography at Bolt Court for {{the final year of}} his scholarship.

It is believed that, after finishing full-time studies at Bolt Court in the summer of 1906, he continued to work at The Daily Chronicle and <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> at other newspapers while studying in the evenings at Bolt Court, though very little is known about this period in his life.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{it would have been}} cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. What is clear is that Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|Radulovacki {{reasoned}} {{that if the}} blocking of adenosine receptors produces excitation, <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> stimulation of the same receptors could induce sleep. He knew that experiments by John Phillis and his group (Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 57:1289-1312, 1979), which utilized an iontophoretic application of adenosine in the brain, had demonstrated adenosine's depressant effect on the responses of neurons in several brain regions and that the general neurophysiological effects of adenosine were shown to be inhibitory. In addition, the preliminary experiments in dogs by Haulica et al. (J. Neurochem. 21:,1019–20, 1973) and the administration of adenosine into the brains of rats, cats and fowl suggested that adenosine was able to produce behavioral sleep. The explanation of adenosine's hypnotic effect was through its interaction with serotonin, widely {{believed to be a}} sleep inducing agent. However, since there was no suggestion how this adenosine-serotonin link was achieved, experiments highlighting the potential role of adenosine in sleep had largely been forgotten.|$|E

25|$|In 303 BC, after a vain siege by Cassander, {{the island}} was {{occupied}} {{for a short time}} by the Lacedaemonian general Cleonymus of Sparta, then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by Agathocles of Syracuse. He offered Corfu as dowry to his daughter Lanassa on her marriage to Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. The island then {{became a member of the}} Epirotic alliance. It was <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> that the settlement of Cassiope was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of Alexander, last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following the naval battle of Paxos, it was captured by the Illyrians, but was speedily delivered by a Roman fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189 BC. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 BC it was attached to the province of Macedonia. In 31 BC, it served Octavian (Augustus) as a base against Mark Antony. From AD 336 onwards, it was ruled by the Eastern Roman Empire. After the definitive division of the Roman Empire in AD 395, Kerkyra remained with the Eastern Roman Empire, known in modern historiography as the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

500|$|Europeans {{encountered}} the bluebuck in the 17th century, {{but it was}} already uncommon by <b>then,</b> <b>perhaps</b> due to its preferred grassland habitat having {{been reduced to a}} [...] range, mainly along the southern coast of South Africa. Sea level changes during the early Holocene may also have contributed to its decline by disrupting the population. The first published mention of the bluebuck is from 1681, and few descriptions of the animal were written while it existed. The few 18th-century illustrations appear to have been based on stuffed specimens. Hunted by European settlers, the bluebuck became extinct around 1800; it was the first large African mammal to face extinction in historical times, followed by the quagga in 1883. Only four mounted specimens remain, in museums in Leiden, Stockholm, Vienna, and Paris, along with skulls and horns in various museums.|$|E

500|$|There is {{some debate}} {{what sort of}} singer {{might have been the}} {{intended}} or actual first performer of Widerstehe doch der Sünde, especially given its low range and tessitura compared with other Alto solo writing by Bach such as [...] or Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust, BWV 170. If the cantata was written early in Bach's (second) Weimar period, <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> the soloist could have been Adam Immanuel Weldig, the only falsettist in the Weimar court chapel in 1708 (the other five singers being a bass, two tenors and two teenage discantists). However, Weldig's designation as [...] "falsettist" [...] may indicate that he was a soprano and not an alto. Weldig left Weimar in 1713 so could not have sung if the first performance was as late as 1714 as suggested by Dürr. Nowadays the solo part in this cantata is usually taken by a contralto or countertenor.|$|E

500|$|According to the Orkneyinga Saga, {{in about}} 872 Harald Fairhair became King {{of a united}} Norway {{and many of his}} opponents fled to the islands of Scotland {{including}} the Hebrides of the west coast, and the Northern Isles. Harald pursued his enemies and incorporated the Northern Isles into his kingdom in 875 and <b>then,</b> <b>perhaps</b> a little over a decade later, the Hebrides as well. The following year the local Viking chieftains of the Hebrides rebelled. Harald then sent Ketill Flatnose to subdue them, which he did quickly, but then he declared himself an independent [...] "King of the Isles", a title he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. Ketill [...] is also sometimes equated with Caittil Find, a reported leader of the Gallgáedil fighting in Ireland in 857, although this connection is far from definite. Ketill left no successors and there is little record of the succeeding four decades.

[...] Scott Alan Marriott of Allgame placed more than simply timing into reasons for the Nomad's lack of sales, stating, [...] "The reason for the Nomad's failure may have very well been a combination of poor timing, company mistrust and the relatively high cost of the machine (without a pack-in). Genesis owners were too skittish to invest in another 16-bit system." [...] The staff of Retro Gamer, however, praised the Nomad, saying in a retrospective that Nomad was [...] "the first true 16-bit handheld" [...] and declared it the best variant of the Genesis. [...] In the same article, Retro Gamer notes the collectability of the Nomad, due to its low production, and states, [...] "Had Sega cottoned on {{to the concept of}} the Nomad before the Mega Drive 2, and rolled it out as a true successor to the Mega Drive ... <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> Sega may have succeeded in its original goal to prolong the life of the Mega Drive in the U.S." ...|$|E

Big Boi has said that he [...] "always start working on albums on Martin Luther King Day. It's a good luck charm". The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Georgia, the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums. Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios, The Slumdrum Dreamhouse, and King of Crunk in Atlanta, Dungeon East Studios in Decatur, Georgia, Instrumental Zoo in Miami, Florida, and Kush Studios in Palm Island, Florida. Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio's environment in an interview for The Guardian, calling it [...] "comfortable but gritty enough to get you in a state of mind of being raw and ready to kill stuff", while noting that the sessions were accompanied by [...] "some candles, a little red light, maybe some crunk juice and a cigar; every now and <b>then</b> <b>perhaps</b> a little 'purple'". While searching for a new record label, he completed recording for the album. The album was mastered on May 27, 2010.|$|E

[...] In a mixed review, Robert Christgau described the album as [...] "A step in the right direction, but only a step".
