5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalist</b> Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> arguments between <b>fundamentalists</b> and <b>the</b> claims made by Nancy Cartwright in The Dappled World. I start by introducing <b>the</b> arguments of <b>fundamentalists</b> through <b>the</b> work of Carl Hoefer, {{and go on to}} discuss Cartwright’s patchwork theory of laws, which is opposed to fundamentalism. Cartwright argues that <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> cannot claim that laws can be generalized, while <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> insist that they can make such claims. I will argue that this conflict between both sides places each side in the same epistemological boat. Once we recognize that both views are in the same boat, it is easier to distinguish which view is better, instead of attempting to prove that one view is superior to the other outright. I will argue that fundamentalism has the upper had in this debate, because this view allows for both theoretical and practical advances to be made in science and technology, while Cartwright’s view only advances the practical applications of current science. Cartwright’s arguments against fundamentalism will also be shown to ask too much of Hoefer and <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists,</b> specifically with her F=ma example. Finally, I will show that fundamentalism can accomplish everything Cartwright’s patchwork theory can and more...|$|R

5000|$|By the 1890s, most American Protestants {{belonged to}} Evangelical denominations, {{except for the}} high church Episcopalians and German Lutherans. In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between <b>the</b> <b>Fundamentalists</b> and <b>the</b> Mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of <b>the</b> Bible. <b>The</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> were those Evangelicals who sought to defend their {{religious}} traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, Evangelicalism was dominated by <b>the</b> <b>Fundamentalists,</b> who rejected liberal theology and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held {{the view that the}} modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, <b>the</b> modernists criticized <b>fundamentalists</b> for their separatism and their rejection of the Social Gospel. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the Scopes Trial of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term [...] "evangelical" [...] and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies.|$|R
