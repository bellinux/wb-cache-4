Nowadays, anxiety is increased in different populations and, thus it is became an important problem in many countries. Melissa officinalis (Melissa) and Valeriana officinalis (Valerian) are two medicinal plants. These two plants are traditionally used as sedative herbal drugs and new studies on their pharmacological activity present the same results. Aerial parts of M. officinalis and rhizomes of V. officinalis were extracted with ethanol: water (70 : 30). The hydroalcoholic extracts were concentrated in vacuum evaporator and then added to an absorbent matrix. Amount of the dried used extracts per one tablet is 180 mg and 60 mg of Melissa and Valerian respectively. After granulation process, other ingredients were added to wet granules and tablets were prepared using a <b>tabletting</b> <b>machine.</b> Tablets tested physically and some modifications were done on the formulation. At last tablets were coated with a film coat by spraying method. As a criterion of active constituents transmission, the amount of trans-caryophillene was determined by GC-MS method. Results of this study indicated that after modification of formulation, tablets with desirable characteristics for film coating had been produced. Physical examinations indicated that the tablets have proper physical characteristics. GC-MS analysis also showed that in spite of long processes of extraction, granulation, and coating, active ingredients transmission was about 38...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} investigation was the evaluation in rabbits of ophthalmic inserts (denominated mini-tablets, MT) for sustained/controlled release of timolol maleate (TiM). The MTs (diameter 3. 5 mm, thickness 1. 5 mm, average TiM content 0. 34 or 0. 68 mg) were prepared by compressing appropriate mixtures of powders with a standard <b>tabletting</b> <b>machine.</b> A thin, rate- controlling membrane was applied over the devices by spraying aqueous dispersions of acrylic copolymers. A first series of different (uncoated and coated) MTs were tested for release of TiM to the lacrimal fluid, using commercial eyedrops (Timoptol® 0. 5 %) as a reference standard. Two MTs (one of which was coated) and the same reference solution were then selected for an ocular absorption study. Analysis of TiM in the aqueous humor indicated that the coated MT was capable of maintaining low and steady levels of TiM for at least 19 h, while the other device, identical but uncoated, produced a prolonged-pulse effect lasting about 8 h. The apparent mean residence time (MRT) of TiM in the aqueous humor was 1. 3 h for the reference solution, 3. 2 h for the uncoated MT, and 5. 7 h for the coated one.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{controlled}} release (CR) formulation of procainamide, an antiarrhythmic drug is well known. The {{aim of this}} investigation was an attempt to establish controlled release procainamide tablet formulations by fluid bed technique. The procainamide granules were prepared, using PVP as binder. A laboratory size fluidlzed bed drier (Uni-Glatt) was used for coating the procainamide granules. As polymers, Eudragit RSPO, ethylcelluiose and Eudragit S 100 + ethylcelluiose (1 : 1) have been utilized. Triethylciirate (TEC) was used as plasticizer in this investigation. The ratio of TEC to polymers was 1 : 9 in most experiments. However, in some formulations this ratio was increased to (1 : 4). "nThe coated granules were compressed using an excentric <b>tabletting</b> <b>machine.</b> Drug release patterns of all formulations prepared were investigated. The dissolution media were consisted of hydrochloric acid buffer pH 1. 5 for the first 2 h and phosphate buffer pH 8. 8 for remaining period of time in all experiments.

Cross section scanning electron micrographs of coated and uncoated granules were taken. Granules coated with Eudragit RSPO, ethylcellulose and the combination of Eudragit S 100 and ethylcellulose (1 : 1) exhibited proper release behaviour. The release profiles were analyzed to check whether the release was diffusion-controlled or followed first-order kinetics. The release from most of the formulations prepared seems to correspond to the first-order kinetics.

Začeli smo tako, da smo v fazi granuliranja v izdelek vgradili 12 kg purificirane vode pri 80 % hitrosti vbrizgavanja granulirne tekočine. S tem postopkom smo v fazi tabletiranja izdelali tablete, ki so dajale neustrezno trdnost in zadovoljivo razpadnost. Nadaljevali smo z vgradnjo 13 kg purificirane vode pri enaki hitrosti vbrizgavanja granulirne tekočine, vendar smo na ta način izdelali tablete, ki so dajale ustrezno trdnost tablet in neustrezen, daljši čas razpadnosti tablet. V nadaljevanju smo spremljali lastnosti granulata pri vgradnji 13 kg purificirane vode pri 100 % hitrosti vbrizgavanja granulirne tekočine, ki pa je v primerjavi s predhodnimi poizkusi dajal najboljše rezultate. Poizkusi so to tezo potrdili. Glede na rezultate postopkov izdelave smo predpostavili maksimalen čas trajanja mehanske operacije in maksimalen navor mešala v fazi granuliranja. Maksimalnih doseženih mehanskih parametrov pri postopku izdelave zdravila ne smemo prekoračiti. Nato smo želeli ugotoviti vpliv časa mešanja suhega granulata in pomožnih snovi pri pripravi zmesi za tabletiranje na trdnost in razpadnost tablet. Ugotovitve so pokazale, da čas homogenizacije v temu namenjenem mešalniku nima nikakršnega vpliva na trdnost in razpadnost tablet. Vpliv nastavitev tabletirnega stroja na kakovost tablet smo želeli dokazati tako, da smo nastavitve na tabletirnem stroju spreminjali in tako spremljali karakteristične parametre tablet. Rezultati so nam pokazali, da z večanjem sile stiskanja ne dosežemo višje trdnosti tablet in tako tudi predpisanega časa razpadnosti tablet.

The {{scope of}} this {{dissertation}} is the optimisation of granulation stage of the technological procedure for production of tablets, used for the medical treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The aim of this optimisation was to achieve the set requirements for hardness and disintegration of tablets in the tabletting stage. Our first experiment started with adding 12 kg of purificated water into the product in the granulation stage by injecting the granular liquid at 80 % of speed. By doing so, we have achieved to produce tablets with corresponding disintegration, {{but they did not}} have the required hardness. In next step we added 13 kg of purificated water with the same injection speed of the granular liquid as in first experiment. In this case the tablets had the required hardness, but the disintegration was not within the set limits. Due to this, we have changed the characteristics of granulate by adding 13 kg of purified water with the injection of granular liquid at 100 % of speed, which in comparison with previous experiments, gave us the best results. The test has confirmed this thesis. With the results obtained by experiments we were able to determine the maximal duration time of mechanical operation and maximal torque of the stirrer in the granulation stage. Determined maximal mechanical parameters should not be exceeded in the production of drug. Afterwards, we intended to establish how the stirring time, of a dry granulate and excipients in the preparation of tabletting mass, influences the hardness and disintegration of tablets. The results showed that time of homogenization in the stirrer does not affect the hardness and disintegration of tablets. We have also tried to demonstrate how the settings of the <b>tabletting</b> <b>machine</b> are affecting the quality of the product. The results showed that by increasing the pressing force, the tablet hardness is not increased tablet hardness and thus the prescribed time of tablet disintegration is not obtained. Finally, the results obtained in present work are summarized and presented in tabular form, wich offers a support for optimization of tablet production. The table demonstrates the influence of control parameters on the product characteristics in the granulation stage...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Diclofenac sodium is a non-steroidal, {{anti-inflammatory}} drug {{used for}} the relief of pain and inflammation. Many patients have difficulty swallowing tablets and consequently do not take medication as prescribed. To achieve optimum benefit of a drug, it is desirable to present it in a formulation which can rapidly disperse in water. This formulation is easier to swallow, therefore enhancing patient compliance. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a stable diclofenac sodium dispersible tablet for easier oral administration. The first step in the product development was an investigative study into the physico-chemical properties, indications, side-effects and contra-indications of diclofenac sodium. Diclofenac sodium - excipient compatibility studies were performed as part of a preformulation study. Methods of evaluation included differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four dispersible tablet formulations were developed. Kollidon CL-M (crospovidone) and Disolcel (croscarmellose sodium) were used as disintegrants in concentrations of 2 % and 5 % of the tablet mass. Tabletting was performed using a Cadmach® (India) single-punch <b>tabletting</b> <b>machine.</b> The four formulations were put on accelerated stability according to ICH guidelines for three months at 25 °C/ 60 %RH, 30 °C/ 65 %RH and 40 °C/ 75 %RH. HPLC was used to determine the identification, chromatographic purity and concentration of diclofenac sodium. Other tests included uniformity of mass, hardness, friability, disintegration, fineness of dispersion, loss on drying and dissolution. Thermal compatibility studies revealed potential interactions between diclofenac sodium and the excipients. Since DSC results only serve as a rough indication of possible interactions, accelerated stability testing using HPLC was used as a more selective method to identify potential interactions between diclofenac sodium and excipients. The HPLC results revealed that no interactions exist between diclofenac sodium and the chosen excipients. At the end of the stability period, no change in the physical appearance of the tablets was observed, except for the samples stored at 40 °C/ 75 % RH which showed a colour change from white to a very light brown after 3 months. Uniformity of mass remained within specification and average tablet mass and diameter remained relatively constant during stability testing. There was an increase in average thickness, hardness, disintegration time and percentage loss on drying with time and increased stress conditions. This correlates with the decrease in friability observed with time. Differences in the disintegration times were noted between Kollidon CL-M® and Disolcel® formulations. The only formulation that disintegrated within 3 minutes was formulation B. Very few particles of formulation B were retained on the 710 urn sieve, indicating a homogeneous dispersion. Assay results for all four formulations were within specification throughout stability and no extra peaks ascribed to diclofenac related compound A or any other impurity were observed. After 30 minutes, more than 85 % of diclofenac sodium in formulations A, B and D was dissolved. The diclofenac sodium in formulation C did not dissolve well. This correlates with the slow disintegration times of formulation C's tablets. Dissolution rates of formulations C and D decreased with time and increased stress conditions, with the effect more pronounced in the case of formulation C. It can be concluded from the stability results that 5 % Disolcel® as disintegrant was superior to a 2 % concentration and to Kollidon CL-M® in concentrations of 2 % and 5 % of the tablet mass. Formulation B (5 % Disolcel®) was chosen as the most favourable formulation with the best marketing possibilities. Stability results were also used to determine storage conditions and set specifications for batch release and stability to ensure that all batches tested against these specifications, meet the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} the compressional behavior of granules containing high load of a Phyllanthus niruri spray-dried extract in eccentric (ETM) and rotary (RTM) tablet presses. Tablets were constituted by spray-dried extract granules (SDEG, 92 %), excipient granules (EXCG, 7. 92 %), and magnesium stearate (0. 08 %). SDEG was obtained by dry granulation and EXCG, composed of microcrystalline cellulose (62. 9 %) and sodium starch glycolate (37. 1 %), by wet granulation. Particle size distribution was fixed between 0. 250 and 0. 850  mm. Tablets did not evidence any mechanical failures, such as lamination or capping, or anomalous weight variation in either <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> types. Upper and lower tablet surface photomicrographs from ETM and RTM tablets showed differences in porosity and texture. Different RTM speeds suggested the visco-plastic behavior of the formulation, since, by slowing down rotation speeds, the tensile strength of the tablets increased significantly, but the porosity and disintegration time were not affected. Tablets produced in RTM showed lower friability and porosity than ETM tablets, which did not reflect on higher tensile strength. The EXCG distribution at upper and lower surfaces from ETM and RTM tablets was quantified by image analysis and evaluated through statistical methods. Spray-dried extract release was not influenced by the type of equipment or operational conditions to which the compacts were submitted. Construction and operation differences between both tablet presses influenced the final product, since tablets with similar tensile strength, made by distinct <b>tablet</b> <b>machines,</b> exhibited different quality parameters...|$|R

50|$|Finally, {{the awkward}} layout of tablet instruments, signals and points levers at Abermule {{meant that it}} was {{possible}} for conflicting movements to be made. The inquiry recommended that <b>tablet</b> <b>machines</b> be placed in the signal box under the sole control of the signalman, and also that starting signals (which gave trains authority to leave the station) be interlocked with the tablet instruments, so that they could not be cleared until the correct tablet had been released. However, this would involve the rebuilding of the station buildings and signal boxes at Abermule and several other small stations, and it was suggested that alternate single-line sections use the electric tablet system and the older electric staff system; there would be no possibility of mistaking a staff for a tablet. The signalling method continued in use on the line until 1988, when it was replaced by the radio-controlled electronic token block system.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to verify how {{and to what extent}} {{rheological}} tests, carried out under dynamic (Heckel) and static (creep, stress/strain) porosity conditions, may serve as a valuable complement to the classic Heckel tests in the characterization of viscoelastic and densification properties of solid materials for pharmaceutical use. Six different modified (pregelatinized) starches were compressed in a rotary <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> equipped to measure force and punch displacement. Tablets were obtained using flat-faced 6 mm diameter punches at different compression pressures. Compression cycles performed at the maximal pressure of 200 MPa were used to build the Heckel plots. Ejected tablets at the 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % porosity levels were used for the stress/strain and creep tests. Parameters obtained with both types of tests were consistent with each other. In particular, among the six starches, lower viscosity values corresponded to lower PY values, and lower elastic modulus values corresponded to lower elastic recovery of the tablet. Mechanical properties of materials can be better characterized if viscoelastic tests performed under dynamic porosity conditions (Heckel analysis) are supported by classical viscoelastic tests carried out under conditions of static porosity...|$|R
40|$|A “simplex-centroid mixture design” {{was used}} to study the direct-compression {{properties}} of binary and ternary mixtures of chitin and two cellulosic direct-compression diluents. Native milled and fractioned (125 – 250  μm) crustacean chitin of lobster origin was blended with microcrystalline cellulose, MCC (Avicel® PH 102) and spray-dried lactose–cellulose, SDLC Cellactose® (composed of a spray-dried mixture of alpha-lactose monohydrate 75 % and cellulose powder 25 %). An instrumented single-punch <b>tablet</b> <b>machine</b> was used for tablet compactions. The flowability of the powder mixtures composed of {{a high percentage of}} chitin and SDLC was clearly improved. The fractioned pure chitin powder was easily compressed into tablets by using a magnesium stearate level of 0. 1 % (w/w) but, as the die lubricant level was 0. 5 % (w/w), the tablet strength collapsed dramatically. The tablets compressed from the binary mixtures of MCC and SDLC exhibited elevated mechanical strengths (> 100  N) independent of the die lubricant level applied. In conclusion, fractioned chitin of crustacean origin can be used as an abundant direct-compression co-diluent with the established cellulosic excipients to modify the mechanical strength and, consequently, the disintegration of the tablets. Chitin of crustacean origin, however, is a lubrication-sensitive material, and this should be taken into account in formulating direct-compression tablets of it...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{establish}} a correlation between water uptake by anhydrous sodium naproxen (ASN) at two different relative humidities and modifications in tableting and densification behaviour under hydration. Water uptake was evaluated at different relative humidities. Models for the hydration kinetics of ASN at 55 % and 86 %. corresponding to the formation of the dihydrated and tetrahydrated forms, respectively, were evaluated assuming Eyring's dependence on temperature. Tabletability, compressibility, compactibility, and densification behaviour were determined using an instrumented single punch <b>tablet</b> <b>machine.</b> Kinetic data are consistent with a model where water molecules enter the crystal preferentially along hydrophilic tunnels existing in the crystal structure and corresponding to the propionate side chain. Water inclusion perturbs the crystallographic structure, causing slight structural changes according to the amount and associated to an increase in entropy. The interposition of water molecules between sodium naproxen molecules weakens intermolecular bonds, and these sites can behave like sliding planes under compression. Such structural changes may explain the improved compression behaviour and modified densification propensity mechanism. Kinetic data describing the water hydration mechanism of ASN explain in an original way the improved tableting and densification properties under hydration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

The effect of different formulation variables namely, membrane weight gain, and amount of pore former in the membrane, were studied. Metoprolol release was inversely proportional to the membrane weight (coating thickness) but directly related to the initial amount of pore former (sorbitol) in the membrane. All polymers and excipients used in optimized formula were found to be compatible with the drug and it was confirmed by FT-IR studies. Drug release from the developed formulations was independent of pH and agitational intensity. The drug release from formulation was proved as dependent on osmotic pressure only. The number of pores was directly proportional to the amount of pore former in the membrane. The manufactured formulations were stable after 45 days of accelerated stability studies...|$|R
40|$|Lactoferrin (Lf) is a {{potential}} drug candidate {{for the treatment of}} oropharyngeal Candida infections. However, for an effective therapeutic treatment an appropriate dosage form is required. Therefore a mucoadhesive tablet for buccal application was developed. Tablets of sufficient strength could be produced on high speed <b>tabletting</b> <b>machines,</b> but they could only be obtained when the protein contained at least 7 % moisture. The tablet contained sodium alginate both for its release-controlling properties as well as for its mucoadhesive properties. Furthermore, phosphate buffer was added to keep the pH of the saliva in the mouth within the range of 6. 5 to 7. 5. In this pH range, Lf has shown to have its highest activity against Candida growth inhibition. The tablet formulation containing Lf had the same antifungal properties as compared with Lf alone, because in most cases identical inhibitory concentrations were observed against several clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. In human volunteers the tablets, containing 250 mg Lf and placed in each pouch, were able to keep the Lf concentration in the saliva at effective levels for at least 2 hr, while the pH of the saliva remained within the desired range. We concluded that the developed mucoadhesive tablet can improve the therapeutic efficacy of Lf and that it is suitable for further clinical research...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop fast dissolving tablet of cinnarizine. A combination of super disintegrants, i. e., sodium starch glycolate (SSG) and crosscarmellose sodium (CCS) were used along with camphor as a subliming material. An optimized concentration of camphor was added to aid the porosity of the tablet. A 3 2 full factorial design was applied to investigate the combined effect of two formulation variables: Amount of SSG and CCS. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was performed to identify the physicochemical interaction between drug and polymer. IR spectroscopy showed that there is no interaction of drug with polymer. In the present study, direct compression was used to prepare the tablets. The powder mixtures were compressed into tablet using flat face multi punch <b>tablet</b> <b>machine.</b> Camphor was sublimed from the tablet by exposing the tablet to vacuum drier at 60 °C for 12 hours. All the formulations were evaluated for their characteristics such as average weight, hardness, wetting time, friability, content uniformity, dispersion time (DT), and dissolution rate. An optimized tablet formulation (F 9) was found to have good hardness of 3. 30 ± 0. 10 kg/cm 2, wetting time of 42. 33 ± 4. 04 seconds, DT of 34. 67 ± 1. 53 seconds, and cumulative drug release of not less than 99 % in 16 minutes...|$|R
30|$|The freshly excised {{and trimmed}} animal tissues were {{mounted on the}} basket end {{attached}} to the probe of the <b>Tablet</b> dissolution <b>machine</b> (Fig.  1 c). The tissues were fastened to the basket end with an elastic band and the gum tablet placed on the mucosal surface carefully. This was then lowered into a beaker containing phosphate buffer solution of pH 6.8. The beaker sits within a large water bath with temperature set at 37  °C. The machine was then set at 50 revolutions per minute which mimics the in vivo physiologic fluid, pH, temperature and peristaltic movement of contractile smooth muscles.|$|R
