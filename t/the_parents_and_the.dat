25|$|Members of the fathers' rights {{movement}} {{campaign for the}} reform of child support guidelines, which in most Western countries are based on maintaining the children's standard of living after separation, and {{on the assumption that}} the children live with one parent and never with the other. Activists state that the current guidelines are arbitrary, provide mothers with financial incentives to divorce, and leave fathers with little discretionary income to enjoy with the children during their parenting time. In the US, fathers' rights activists propose guidelines based on a Cost Shares model, in which child support would be based on the average income of <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> estimated child costs incurred by both parents. Laura W. Morgan has stated that it focuses on the relative living standards of divorcing parents rather than the best interests of the children and financially supporting them at the same level after divorce.|$|E
500|$|The Mathews test {{employed}} {{consists of}} three considerations: the private interests affected, the risk posed by erroneous judgement, and the government interest affected. The Court found that private interests were substantially affected by the law noting that [...] "hen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it" [...] and that such a termination was irreversible. In analyzing the second factor, the Court stated that the interests of <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> child in their natural relationship are not distinct and thus the balancing factors are between <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> State. The Court then found that the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] burden did not fairly allocate risk and that a higher burden would be practically and symbolically important. The Court found that while the State had an interest, a higher burden would have little impact on the ability for the State to achieve its goal. Following from this review, the Court held that [...] "the State [...] support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|When parents {{divorce and}} the {{children}} are in the picture, many problems will arise during the difficult process of determining custody. [...] For instance, {{if there is an}} argument regarding joint legal custody, the process to earn legal custody will take longer than anticipated and will ultimately impact the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> children. [...] It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds, which, in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody. [...] Another criticism of having a joint legal custody arrangement {{is that it is a}} frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child's life (regardless of what the decree of joint legal custody states), which generally leads to conflict. Additionally, in a joint legal custody arrangement, if the parents of the children do not get along, this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that needs to be made about their children, which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved, but also for the parents.|$|E

500|$|Compared to {{most other}} raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest {{building}} or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep {{snow in the}} North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July. The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as [...] deep, [...] across and weigh one nest in Florida {{was found to be}} [...] deep, [...] across, and to weigh [...] This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal. Usually nests are used for under five years or so, as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the Midwest was occupied continuously for at least 34 years. The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska. In Sonora, Mexico, eagles have been observed nesting on top of Hecho catcuses (Pachycereus pectinaboriginum). Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in California, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, but currently are only verified to occur only in Alaska and Arizona. The eggs average about [...] long, ranging from , and have a breadth of , ranging from [...] Eggs in Alaska averaged [...] in mass, while in Saskatchewan they averaged [...] As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of polygyny. Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs. it is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it. Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different. However, nearly half of known bald eagle produce two fledgings (more rarely three), unlike in some other [...] "eagle" [...] species such as some in the Aquila genus, in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby). A young eaglet can gain up to [...] a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird. The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air. The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development. For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce. Additionally, as shown by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary located near Sydney, British Columbia on June 9, 2017, bald eagles have been recently recorded to occasionally adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests. The pair of eagles in question were recorded carrying a juvenile red-tailed hawk back to their nest, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eagles' three fledgelings. Whether or not the chick survived remained to be seen at the time, as bald eagles are known for committing fratricide amongst their siblings. However, the aggression of the red-tailed hawk may ensure its survival, as the hawks are well known for their ability to successfully defend against an eagle attack. Six weeks after however, it was discovered that the hawk, nicknamed [...] "Spunky" [...] by biologists monitoring the nest, had grown to fledgeling size and was learning how to hunt, indicating that it successfully survived.|$|E
