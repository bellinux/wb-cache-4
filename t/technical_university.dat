Analysis of practical training in medical universities has established that some practical training processes have propedeutic character and are implemented according to the curriculum before the theoretical learning of the subject by students. Practical training evaluation in <b>technical</b> <b>universities</b> has established that none of the practical training processes has propedeutic character and practical training is conducted only one academic year after the theoretical learning of the subject. In addition, practical training in <b>technical</b> <b>universities</b> is complex and includes students’ practice at pharmaceutical factory.
