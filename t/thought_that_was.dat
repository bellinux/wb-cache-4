5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket.

His South Australian and Australian team mate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
5000|$|The Generality Constraint, {{according}} to Evans, {{is intended to}} capture the structure <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> in <b>thought.</b> As Evans puts it, [...] "The <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> John <b>is</b> happy has {{something in common with}} the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Harry <b>is</b> happy, and the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> John <b>is</b> happy has something in common with the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> John <b>is</b> sad" [...] (1982, p. 100). The Generality Constraint requires <b>that</b> if one <b>is</b> to have a <b>thought</b> (<b>that</b> John <b>is</b> happy, for example) about an object (John), then one must be able to conceive of the object (John) as having different properties (such as being sad).|$|R

25|$|Knowledge of the spherical {{shape of}} the Earth was {{received}} in scholarship of Late Antiquity {{as a matter of}} course, in both Neoplatonism and Early Christianity.

25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> rather discouraging.|$|E

25|$|The Ashokan {{policy of}} Dhamma {{has been the}} subject of {{controversy}} and debate amongst scholars; Some have said that Ashoka was a partisan Buddhist and have equated Dhamma with Buddhism. It has also been suggested that it was the original Buddhist <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> being preached by Ashoka as Dhamma and later on certain theological additions were made to Buddhism. This kind of thinking is based on some Buddhist chronicles. It is believed that the Kalinga war was a dramatic turning point where out of remorse for the death and destruction of war, Ashoka decided to become Buddhist. The Buddhist records credit him with the propagation of Buddhism in India and aboard. As an emperor, Ashoka did not favour Buddhism at the expenses of other religions.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.|$|E
