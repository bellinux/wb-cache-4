25|$|Trazodone is {{generally}} described as {{acting as a}} potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Its 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and weak serotonin reuptake inhibition {{form the basis of}} its common label as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). Trazodone, both itself and via its major active metabolite meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), also binds to a variety of other receptors. It is an antagonist at most or all of the receptors it binds to except the 5-HT1A receptor, where it acts as a partial agonist similarly to buspirone and <b>tandospirone</b> but with comparatively greater intrinsic activity. Conversely, mCPP is a non-selective agonist of most of the serotonin receptors it binds to.

50|$|<b>Tandospirone</b> acts as {{a potent}} and {{selective}} 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, with a Ki affinity value of 27 ± 5 nM and approximately 55 to 85% intrinsic activity. It has weak and clinically negligible affinity for the 5-HT2A (1,300 ± 200), 5-HT2C (2,600 ± 60), α1-adrenergic (1,600 ± 80), α2-adrenergic (1,900 ± 400), D1 (41,000 ± 10,000), and D2 (1,700 ± 300) receptors, and is essentially inactive at the 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, β-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin transporter, and benzodiazepine allosteric site of the GABAA receptor (all of which are > 100,000).

5000|$|... 5-HT1A {{receptor}} agonists like buspirone and flesinoxan show efficacy in relieving {{anxiety and}} depression, and buspirone and <b>tandospirone</b> are currently approved for these indications {{in various parts}} of the world. Others such as gepirone, flesinoxan, flibanserin, and naluzotan have also been investigated, though none have been fully developed and approved yet. Some of the atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole are also partial agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor and are sometimes used in low doses as augmentations to standard antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
50|$|Eptapirone {{and related}} high-efficacy 5-HT1A full and super {{agonists}} such as befiradol and F-15,599 were developed under {{the hypothesis that}} the maximum exploitable therapeutic benefits of 5-HT1A receptor agonists {{might not be able to}} be seen without the drugs employed possessing sufficiently high intrinsic activity at the receptor. As 5-HT1A receptor agonism, based on animal and other research, looked extremely promising for the treatment of depression from a theoretical perspective, this idea was developed as a potential explanation for the relatively modest clinical effectiveness seen with already available 5-HT1A receptor agonists like buspirone and <b>tandospirone,</b> which act merely as weak-to-moderate partial agonists of the receptor.|$|E
50|$|While {{some of the}} listed {{properties}} such as 5-HT2A and D2 blockade may {{be useful}} in certain indications such as in the treatment of schizophrenia (as with perospirone and tiospirone), all of them except 5-HT1A agonism are generally undesirable in anxiolytics and only contribute to side effects. As a result, further development has commenced to bring more selective of anxiolytic agents to the market. An example of this initiative is gepirone, which is currently in clinical trials in the United States for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Another example is <b>tandospirone</b> which has been licensed in Japan for the treatment of anxiety and as an augmentation to antidepressants for depression.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to {{examine the effect of}} <b>tandospirone</b> on sleep latency in a new insomnia animal model by placing rats on a grid suspended over water. For investigating the mechanism of <b>tandospirone,</b> the effect of <b>tandospirone</b> on sleep latency was also studied using rats that were depleted with neuronal serotonin (5 -HT) after p-chlorophenylalanine administration. <b>Tandospirone</b> caused a shortening of sleep latency dose-dependently, and a significant effect was observed at 20 mg /kg, p. o. or more. A shortening of sleep latency was observed by administration of p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg /kg, i. p.) for 2 days. On the other hand, <b>tandospirone</b> exerted no potentiating effect on the shortening of sleep latency induced by p-chlorophenylalanine. From these findings, a shortening of sleep latency induced by <b>tandospirone</b> may occur through the pre-synaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in rats...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tandospirone,</b> an azapirone, is a {{selective}} serotonin(1 A) (5 -HT 1 A) receptor agonist. The effects of <b>tandospirone</b> on plasma hormones and on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase {{activity in the}} brain of male rats were studied. <b>Tandospirone</b> produced a time- and dose-dependent increase in plasma levels of oxytocin, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), corticosterone, and prolactin. The minimal dose of <b>tandospirone</b> {{that led to a}} significant elevation of plasma oxytocin, ACTH, and prolactin levels was 1. 0 mg/kg (s. c.), while the minimal dose for corticosterone release was 3. 0 mg/kg (s. c.). The ED 50 of <b>tandospirone</b> was 1. 3 mg/kg for oxytocin, 1. 2 mg/kg for ACTH, 3. 0 mg/kg for corticosterone, and 0. 24 mg/kg for prolactin. Pretreatment with the specific 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY 100, 635 (0. 3 mg/kg, s. c.) completely blocked the effects of <b>tandospirone</b> on plasma levels of oxytocin, ACTH, and corticosterone but shifted the dose-response curve for prolactin to the right. <b>Tandospirone</b> injection (10 mg/kg, s. c.) stimulated the MAP kinase signaling cascade, specifically the phosphorylation of p 42 / 44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) as well as the dorsal raphe nucleus 5 min following <b>tandospirone</b> injection. These increases were blocked by pretreatment with WAY 100, 635 (0. 3 mg/kg). The results are the first evidence that systemic 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist administration produces a rapid increase in p-ERK levels in vivo, providing further insight into the signaling mechanisms of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor...|$|E
40|$|Background Cancer {{cachexia}} {{is thought}} to be the cause of > 20 % of cancer related deaths. Symptoms of cancer cachexia patients include depression and anorexia significantly worsening their quality of life. Moreover, in rodent models of cancer cachexia atrophy of the heart has been shown to impair cardiac function. Here, we characterize the effects of the antidepressant and anxiolytic drug <b>tandospirone</b> on wasting, cardiac function and survival in experimental cancer cachexia. Methods The well-established Yoshida hepatoma rat model was used and tumor-bearing rats were treated with 1 mg/kg/d (LD), 10 mg/kg/d (HD) <b>tandospirone</b> or placebo. Weight, body composition (NMR), cardiac function (echocardiography), activity and food intake were assessed. Noradrenalin and cortisol were measured in plasma and caspase activity in skeletal muscle. Results Ten mg/kg/d <b>tandospirone</b> decreased the loss of body weight (p = 0. 0003) compared to placebo animals, mainly due to preservation of muscle mass (p < 0. 001), while 1 mg/kg/d <b>tandospirone</b> was not effective. Locomotor activity (p = 0. 0007) and food intake (p = 0. 0001) were increased by HD <b>tandospirone.</b> The weight (p = 0. 0277) and function of heart (left ventricular mass, fractional shortening, stroke volume, ejection fraction, all p < 0. 05) were significantly improved. In the HD <b>tandospirone</b> group, plasma levels of noradrenalin and cortisol were significantly reduced by 49 % and 52 %, respectively, which {{may have contributed to the}} lower caspase activity in the gastrocnemius muscle. Most importantly, HD <b>tandospirone</b> significantly improved survival compared to placebo rats (HR: 0. 34; 95 % CI: 0. 13 – 0. 86; p = 0. 0495). Conclusion <b>Tandospirone</b> showed significant beneficial effects in the Yoshida hepatoma cancer cachexia model and should be further examined as a prospective drug for this syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Rationale Augmentation {{therapy with}} serotonin- 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) {{receptor}} partial agonists {{has been suggested}} to improve cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Decreased activity of prefrontal cortex may {{provide a basis for}} cognitive deficits of the disease. Lactate plays {{a significant role in the}} supply of energy to the brain, and glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to lactate production. Objectives and methods The purposes of this study were to examine the effect of repeated administration (once a daily for 4 days) of <b>tandospirone</b> (0. 05 and 5 mg/kg) on brain energy metabolism, as represented by extracellular lactate concentration (eLAC) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of young adult rats [...] Results Four-day treatment with MK- 801, an NMDA-R antagonist, prolonged eLAC elevation induced by foot shock stress (FS). Co-administration with the high-dose <b>tandospirone</b> suppressed prolonged FS-induced eLAC elevation in rats receiving MK- 801, whereas <b>tandospirone</b> by itself did not affected eLAC increment. Conclusions These results suggest that stimulation of 5 -HT 1 A receptors ameliorates abnormalities of energy metabolism in the mPFC due to blockade of NMDA receptors. These findings provide a possible mechanism based on brain energy metabolism by which 5 -HT 1 A agonism improve cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and related disorders...|$|E

Based hypoglutamaterg hypothesis of schizophrenia is the current strategy {{in the search for}} new drugs indirect activation of NMDA receptors. Direct activation of NMDA receptors leads to neuronal damage. The aim of the thesis was to determine whether NMDA receptors interact with 5 -HT 1 A receptors as the molecular and the behavioral level.

AP 521 showed equal or more potent anxiolytic-like effects compared with diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, or <b>tandospirone,</b> a partial 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 1 A receptor agonist, in three rat anxiety models; the Vogel-type conflict test, elevated plus maze test, and conditioned fear stress test. Although AP 521 did not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor, it did bind to 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 1 B, 5 -HT 1 D, 5 -HT 5 A and 5 -HT 7 receptors, and showed agonist activity for the human 5 -HT 1 A receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells. <b>Tandospirone,</b> which can stimulate the presynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the raphe, tended to decrease extracellular 5 -HT concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. In contrast, AP 521 increased extracellular 5 -HT concentration. In addition, AP 521 enhanced the anti-freezing effect of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the fear conditioning model in rats and enhanced the citalopram-caused increase of the extracellular 5 -HT concentration in the mPFC. These results suggest that AP 521 exhibits potent anxiolytic effects by acting as a postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist and by enhancing serotonergic neural transmission in the mPFC by a novel mechanism of action...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>tandospirone</b> (TDS) on dissociated rat dorsal raphe neurones were {{investigated}} using the patch-clamp method. Under current-clamp conditions, TDS hyperpolarized the cell membrane, {{resulting in the}} reduction of firing rates. Under voltage-clamp conditions, TDS induced an inward rectifying K+ current in a concentration-dependent manner. The TDS-induced K+ currents (ITDS) were mimicked by 8 -OH-DPAT, a 5 -HT 1 A agonist. The ITDS was blocked by spiperone, a 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist, in a concentration-dependent manner. N-Ethylmaleimide, an agent which uncouples between the receptor and the G-protein, irreversibly blocked the ITDS. In neurones perfused intracellularly with a pipette-solution containing GTP using the conventional whole-cell patch recording, the ITDS showed a gradual rundown. When the neurones were perfused with GTPγS, TDS activated the inwardly rectifying K+ current in an irreversible manner. In the inside-out patch recording mode, TDS-activated single K+ channel currents (iTDS) which also showed an inward rectification. When the GDP in cytosolic side was completely replaced with GTP, the open probability of iTDS significantly increased.

40|$|Abstract: Middle ear surgery (tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy) {{performed}} {{under general}} or local anesthesia is associ-ated {{with a high}} incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 50 % and 80 % of patients who un-dergo these surgical procedures experience PONV. Numerous antiemetics have been studied for the prevention of PONV after middle ear surgery. Traditional antiemetics, including anticholinergics (e. g., scopolamine), phenothiazines (e. g., promethazine), butyrophenones (e. g., droperidol), and benzamide (e. g., metoclopramide), are used for the prevention of PONV during 0 - 24 h after anesthesia. The available nontraditional antiemetics that {{have been shown to be}} effective for the prophylaxis against PONV are propofol, dexamethasone, <b>tandospirone,</b> and midazolam. Antiserotinins (ondansetron, granisetron, and ramosetron) are highly effective in decreasing the incidence of PONV for 24 h postoperatively, compared with traditional antiemetics. Ramosetron is effective for the long-term (up to 48 h) prevention of PONV. None of the available antiemetics is entirely effective, perhaps because most of them act through the blockade on one type of receptor. There is a possibility that combined antiemetics with different sites of activity would be more effective than one drug alone for preventing PONV. Nonpharmacological technique is acustimulation at P 6 (Nei-Kuwan) point. Clinicians should consider these clinical strategies as mentioned above for preventing PONV after middle ear surgery in adult patients...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{impairments}} {{are considered}} to largely affect functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia, other psychotic illnesses, or mood disorders. Specifically, there is {{much attention to the}} role of psychotropic compounds acting on serotonin (5 -HT) receptors in ameliorating cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. It is noteworthy that atypical antipsychotic drugs, e. g. clozapine, melperone, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, perospirone, blonanserin, and lurasidone, have variable affinities for these receptors. Among the 5 -HT receptor subtypes, the 5 -HT 1 A receptor is attracting particular interests as a potential target for enhancing cognition, based on preclinical and clinical evidence. The neural network underlying the ability of 5 -HT 1 A agonists to treat cognitive impairments of schizophrenia likely includes dopamine, glutamate, and GABA neurons. A novel strategy for cognitive enhancement in psychosis may be benefitted by focusing on energy metabolism in the brain. In this context, lactate plays a major role, and has been shown to protect neurons against oxidative and other stressors. In particular, our data indicate chronic treatment with <b>tandospirone,</b> a partial 5 -HT 1 A agonist, recover stress-induced lactate production in the prefrontal cortex of a rat model of schizophrenia. Recent advances of electrophysiological measures, e. g. event-related potentials, and their imaging have provided insights into facilitative effects on cognition of some atypical antipsychotic drugs acting directly or indirectly on 5 -HT 1 A receptors.
