5|$|On Midsummer 1953 Gardner invited Valiente {{again to}} Woodford-Grimes's house, {{and it was}} here that he {{initiated}} her into Wicca in a ritual during which they stood before an altar and he read from his Book of Shadows. The three of them then set off to the prehistoric monument of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, where they witnessed the Druids performing a ritual there. Gardner had lent a ritual sword which he owned to the Druids, who placed it within the monument's Heel Stone during their rite. Valiente <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> and mother about the visit to Stonehenge, but not about her initiation, of which, she feared, they would not have approved.|$|E
5|$|Editor Donald A. Wollheim {{was working}} at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new {{paperback}} publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Rakesh tells Raj about {{a defect}} in the company's new mobile handset: a call goes to two people simultaneously—the {{intended}} recipient and another random person on the phone's contact list. Raj needs Sonia's permission to stop production, and she invites him to her house to discuss the matter. Sonia makes provocative and sexually explicit statements to Raj, who ignores her. She then aggressively tries to pursue Raj, who resists. Although he repeatedly rejects her advances, Sonia continues trying to seduce him. As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> that he sexually harassed her. Since he has admitted finding Sonia attractive, his claim of innocence is not believed, and the company pressures him into resignation.|$|E

25|$|When Skarbek's husband, Jerzy Giżycki, was {{informed}} that Skarbek and Kowerski's services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed {{out of his own}} career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> that she loved Kowerski, Giżycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada. The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in Berlin on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. Vera Atkins, assistant to the head of F Section, later described Skarbek as a very brave woman, but a law unto herself and a loner.|$|E
25|$|Sir Bernard Docker {{took the}} extra {{responsibility}} of Daimler's managing director in January 1953 when James Leek {{was unable to}} continue through illness. Car buyers were {{still waiting for the}} new (Churchill) government's easing of the 'temporary' swingeing purchase tax promised in the lead up to the snap-election held during the 1951 Earl's Court motor show. Lady Docker <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> to rethink his marketing policies. 3-litre Regency production was stopped. In the hope of keeping 4,000+ employed the Consort price was dropped from 4 February 1953 to the expected new tax-inclusive level.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Cindy McCain {{developed}} {{an addiction to}} Percocet and Vicodin, opioid painkillers, which she initially took to alleviate pain following two spinal surgeries for ruptured discs and to ease emotional stress during the Keating Five affair. [...] The addiction progressed to where she was taking upwards of twenty pills a day, and she resorted to having an AVMT physician write illegal prescriptions {{in the names of}} three AVMT employees without their knowledge. [...] In 1992, her parents staged an intervention to force her to get help; she <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> about her problem, attended a drug treatment facility, began outpatient sessions and ended her three years of addiction. [...] Surgery in 1993 resolved her back pain.|$|E

Tatlock had introduced Oppenheimer to the poetry of John Donne, and it is widely believed he named the first test of a nuclear weapon [...] "Trinity" [...] in reference to one of Donne's poems, as a tribute to her.

500|$|In {{accordance}} with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred {{to stay in}} character in between scenes during many of her early films, {{and as a result}} had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> Jonny Lee Miller, that she {{would not be able to}} phone him: [...] "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'" [...] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had [...] "nothing else to give." [...] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting. Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.|$|E

The same day, Selena and Saldívar argued by telephone; Selena hung up and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> she could no longer trust Saldívar. According to Quintanilla, Jr. there were four attempts to murder Selena. Selena removed Saldívar's name from the boutique's bank account on March 10, 1995; she was replaced as fan club president by Irene Herrera. The next day, Saldívar purchased a gun at A Place to Shoot, a gun shop and shooting range in San Antonio. She bought a Taurus Model 85 snub-nosed [...]38-caliber revolver and [...]38 caliber hollow-point bullets; the bullets were designed to cause more extensive injuries than normal bullets.

In 1956, however, Ehrenburg <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>her</b> <b>husband's</b> execution while visiting Paris.

When the couple's first child was stillborn, Gates {{returned to his}} old pattern of playing poker and thought seriously about leaving town with Dellora. With this knowledge, Mary Gates <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> he needed to help his son financially so he could start a new business. [...] Gates' father-in-law, Ed Baker, had already offered to help his daughter and son in law in this way. Asel purchased a two-story brick building and Ed Baker provided the capital for stock to open a hardware store in Turner Junction. At first the business went well; Gates and Dellora were able to move into their own home. [...] Gates began taking {{time away from the}} hardware store and while his partner tried to handle all the business, he was not able to. A son, Charles Gilbert Gates, was born to Gates and Dellora on May 21, 1876.

[...] They had to move into two rooms above the hardware store, with Gates saying he was too ill to help with the moving and packing.|$|E
500|$|Two {{people on}} the {{aircraft}} made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas. During the call, which lasted nearly two minutes, May said her flight was being hijacked by six persons, and staff and passengers had been moved {{to the rear of}} the airplane. May asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking. Between 09:16 and 09:26, passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the airplane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. She reported that the passengers, including the pilots, had been moved to the back of the cabin and that the hijackers were unaware of her call. A minute into the conversation, the call was cut off. Theodore Olson contacted the command center at the Department of Justice, and tried unsuccessfully to contact Attorney General John Ashcroft. About five minutes later, Barbara Olson called again, <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> that the [...] "pilot" [...] (possibly Hanjour on the cabin intercom) had announced the flight was hijacked, and asked, [...] "What do I tell the pilot to do?" [...] Ted Olson asked her location and she reported the plane was flying low over a residential area. He told her of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Soon afterward, the call cut off again.|$|E
500|$|This {{editorial}} {{position would}} come back to haunt Stone. Also in 1870, Elizabeth Roberts Tilton <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> Theodore Tilton that she had been carrying on an adulterous relation with his good friend Henry Ward Beecher. Theodore Tilton published an editorial saying that Beecher [...] "has at a most unseemly time of life been detected in improper intimacies with certain ladies of his congregation." [...] Tilton also informed Stanton about the alleged affair, and Stanton passed the information to Victoria Woodhull. Woodhull, a free love advocate, printed innuendo about Beecher, and began to woo Tilton, convincing him to write a book of her life story from imaginative material that she supplied. In 1871, Stone wrote to a friend [...] "my one wish in regard to Mrs. Woodhull is, that [...] she nor her ideas, may be so much as heard of at our meeting." [...] Woodhull's self-serving activities were attracting disapproval from both centrist AWSA and radical NWSA. To divert criticism from herself, Woodhull published a denunciation of Beecher in 1872 saying that he practiced free love in private while speaking out against it from the pulpit. This caused a sensation in the press, and resulted in an inconclusive legal suit and a subsequent formal inquiry lasting well into 1875. The furor over adultery and the friction between various camps of women's rights activists took focus away from legitimate political aims. Harry Blackwell wrote to Stone from Michigan where he was working toward putting woman suffrage into the state constitution, saying [...] "This Beecher-Tilton affair is playing the deuce with [...] in Michigan. No chance of success this year I fancy." ...|$|E
