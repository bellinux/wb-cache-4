5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to <b>take</b> <b>good</b> care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E

However, if a woman dies, the creation of a Churel can be still prevented and precautionary measures exist and are taken if a woman becomes one. In Tamil culture human priests gather and collectively propitiate her with offerings. In some villages, a Stonehenge-like structure is used to ward off the Churel.|$|E

Shalit's living quarters were described as a two-room underground store with enough supplies for two weeks, accessible down a ladder through a 15-meter-deep shaft lined with explosives. The report added that the guards receive supplies and newspaper clippings every two weeks, and that they had been ordered to <b>take</b> <b>good</b> care of Shalit.|$|E

500|$|Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved {{reluctant}} to create starring roles for Wong; her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing {{her as a}} leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the Museum of the Moving Image, notes, [...] "She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn't {{know what to do}} with her." [...] She spent the next few years in supporting roles providing [...] "exotic atmosphere", for instance playing a concubine in Tod Browning's Drifting (1923). Film producers capitalized on Wong's growing fame but they relegated her to supporting roles. Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: [...] "Pictures are fine and I'm getting along all right, but it's not so bad to have the laundry back of you, so you can wait and <b>take</b> <b>good</b> parts and be independent when you're climbing." ...|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I want you to <b>take</b> <b>good</b> {{care of all the}} {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E

He explains that he once knew another man who wanted to marry a smart beautiful woman against his family's wishes. Sonny's mother interprets for Young Wasim, realizing {{he is talking about}} her, and she finally gives the couple her blessing.

The investor agrees to fund Sonny's plans for renovation so long as Muriel stays on as an assistant manager.|$|E
500|$|Writer Martin Aston {{notes that}} Albini [...] "stress live {{performances}} and quick takes". Wiggs has recalled that Albini's main concern was ensuring the best sound {{possible from the}} musical equipment, rather than attempting to improve the band's performances; {{as long as the}} group succeeded in playing each song all the way through, Albini considered that <b>take</b> <b>good</b> enough for the album. According to Wiggs, Albini's [...] "hands-off" [...] style of engineering greatly helped to shape the sound of the recordings. Albini's contributions included convincing the band members {{to reduce the number of}} harmonies in the songs and give more prominence to Deal's vocals; Donelly believes this improved the album, by making the performances [...] "more effective and sadder and... focused". The tempo of the songs was faster than Wiggs had envisioned; this was necessary because Deal could not keep her breath long enough to slow down each note. The Breeders recorded the Lennon–McCartney composition [...] "Happiness is a Warm Gun" [...] at the request of Ivo-Watts.|$|E
500|$|Before her death, Rückerschöld {{would write}} two more {{books on the}} topic of {{housekeeping}} and cooking: Fattig Mans Wisthus och Kök, ("Poor Man's Larder and Kitchen") and En Liten Hushålls-Cateches ("A Small Household Catechism"). The first book was published in 1796, and [...] aimed for a broader readership than the previous books. This included not just modest urban households, but also peasant wives who made up {{the majority of the population}} in Sweden at the time. Again Rückerschöld stressed the importance that women know proper housekeeping skills, and urged them to <b>take</b> <b>good</b> care of the household economy to keep incompetent husbands from wrecking the family budget. Other than directions for simple dishes, there was money-saving strategies like baking one's own bread or cooperating with neighbors to buy larger quantities of food at lower prices. In the book Rückerschöld portrays herself as going on inspection in a peasant household, being shown the barn, larder, vegetable garden, etc., and having suggestions for improvements everywhere. Fattig Mans Wisthus och Kök was awarded a silver medal by Patriotiska Sällskapet ("The Patriotic Society") for being the first cookbook written for poorer households. Twenty years earlier, the society had issued a challenge with this aim, but no one before Rückerschöld had managed to write such a book. In 1797, one year after the book was first published, a second edition came out.|$|E

500|$|When Roberts & Vinter {{made the}} {{decision}} to close down New Worlds in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. [...] Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: [...] "It would be on art paper, to <b>take</b> <b>good</b> quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, Playboy so that it would get good display space on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [...] Burroughs and [...] Paolozzi, but it would be 'popular', it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde." [...] Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: [...] "Editors who are willing to take a risk on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads." [...] The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of New Worlds, though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.|$|E
