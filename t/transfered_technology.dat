Although human gene <b>transfer</b> <b>technology</b> is widely accepted on therapeutic grounds the non-therapeutic use of gene <b>transfer</b> <b>technology</b> {{remains to be}} a gray zone for moral deliberation. The present discussion addresses several ethical issues concerning the impacts of human gene <b>transfer</b> <b>technology</b> on individuals, the society, and future people. Accordingly, the study examines major ethical issues concerning the use of human gene <b>transfer</b> <b>technology</b> in general and genetic enhancement in particular, and reliability of the putative demarcation between therapy and enhancement, and further proposes ethical guidelines for non-therapeutic application of human gene <b>transfer</b> <b>technology.</b> A special attention is given to three major ethical issues, such as our obligation to future generations, problems concerning justice, fairness, and equality, {{and the problem of}} uncertainty...|$|R
