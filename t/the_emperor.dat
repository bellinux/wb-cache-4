5|$|In 1983's Return of the Jedi, <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> {{appears in}} person {{to oversee the}} last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Darth Vader that they will {{together}} turn Luke, now revealed to be Vader's son, to the dark side. Unknown to Vader, <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. <b>The</b> <b>Emperor</b> tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader throws <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} <b>the</b> <b>emperor,</b> it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with <b>the</b> <b>emperor,</b> or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with <b>the</b> <b>Emperor,</b> whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
5|$|But <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> {{rejected}} {{an outright}} invasion.

He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E

5|$|In Han government, <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> was {{the supreme}} judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E

5|$|In the {{hierarchical}} social order, <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> {{was at the}} apex of Han society and government.

Holding <b>the</b> Zhengtong <b>Emperor</b> in captivity was a useless bargaining chip by the Mongols as long as another sat on his throne, so they released him back into Ming China. <b>The</b> Zhengtong <b>Emperor</b> was placed under house arrest in the palace until the coup against <b>the</b> Jingtai <b>Emperor</b> in 1457, which {{is known as the}} [...] "Wresting the Gate Incident". <b>The</b> Zhengtong <b>Emperor</b> retook <b>the</b> throne as <b>the</b> Tianshun <b>Emperor</b> (r. 1457–1464).|$|R

5|$|In this manner, the Emperor's modern role {{is often}} {{compared}} {{to those of the}} Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others nominally appointed by <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> himself.

5|$|Matthias {{concluded}} {{an alliance}} with the Teutonic Knights and the Bishopric of Ermland against Poland in March 1477. However, instead of Poland, he declared war on Emperor Frederick after he learnt that <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> had confirmed Vladislaus Jagiellon's position as King of Bohemia and Prince-elector. Matthias invaded Lower Austria and imposed a blockade on Vienna. Vladislaus Jagiellon denied to support <b>the</b> <b>Emperor,</b> forcing him to seek reconciliation with Matthias. With the mediation of Pope Sixtus IV, Venice, and Ferdinand I of Naples, Matthias concluded a peace treaty with Frederick III, which was signed on 1 December. <b>The</b> <b>Emperor</b> promised to confirm Matthias as the lawful ruler of Bohemia and to pay him an indemnity of 100,000 florins.
