5|$|CNET {{also criticized}} the iPad for its {{apparent}} lack of wireless sync which other portable devices such as Microsoft's Zune have had {{for a number of}} years. <b>The</b> <b>built-in</b> iTunes app is able to download from the Internet as well.|$|E
5|$|PHP {{defines a}} large array of {{functions}} in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented in the online PHP documentation. However, <b>the</b> <b>built-in</b> library has {{a wide variety of}} naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under history above.|$|E

40|$|Efficiency and {{practical}} considerations necessitate <b>the</b> inclusion of <b>built-ins</b> in a logic programming language. We describe our work in realizing certain built-in procedures {{in a new}} implementation of Prolog, a higher-order logic programming language. This new implementation {{is based on an}} abstract machine tailored to Prolog much in the spirit of Warren's abstract machine for Prolog. We first describe how the specific task of implementing built-ins fits into this general implementation scheme. We then discuss certain difficulties and challenges involved in implementing <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>built-in</b> functions, <b>the</b> output <b>built-in,</b> and <b>the</b> input <b>built-in.</b> We give some detail to our solutions to these implementation problems...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>built-in</b> Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR {{interface}} allows wireless headphones and keyboards to be {{used with}} the iPad. However iOS does not currently support file transfer via Bluetooth. iPad also features 1024×768 VGA video output for limited applications, screen capture, connecting an external display or television through an accessory adapter.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from <b>the</b> <b>built-in</b> amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|The GR1A and GR4A were {{equipped}} with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (Sideways Looking Infra Red) sensor {{on each side}} of the fuselage forward of the engine intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage's underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS video tapes. The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod has replaced <b>the</b> <b>built-in</b> TIRRS system.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>built-in</b> {{gyroscope}} {{allows for}} some image stabilization {{for the camera}} while recording video, although it still has room for improvement, since state-of-the-art image stabilization algorithms {{do not need to}} use a gyroscope, but use image processing. Other features of the camera are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including being able to take its first picture in 1.1seconds and the next half a second later.|$|E
5|$|The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC. Apple ported its iWork suite {{from the}} Mac to the iPad, and sells pared-down {{versions}} of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps in the App Store. Although the iPad is {{not designed to}} replace a mobile phone, a user can use a wired headset or <b>the</b> <b>built-in</b> speaker and microphone to place phone calls over Wi-Fi or 3G using a VoIP application.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, a free {{mobile app}} {{entitled}} The Everyday Heroes of Postman’s Park was launched. The app provides detailed accounts {{of each of}} the fifty-four incidents recorded on the Memorial and reveals the lives of the sixty-two people commemorated. The app employs image recognition technology and <b>the</b> <b>built-in</b> camera on the device to scan each tablet and then deliver the relevant information about the person. The app is the result of collaboration between Prossimo Ventures Ltd and Dr John Price of the University of Roehampton, supported by Creativeworks London, a Knowledge Exchange Hub for the Creative Economy funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The app can be used on a range of devices including iPhone, iPad and Android devices.|$|E

5|$|Previously, viewing YouTube {{videos on}} a {{personal}} computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser. In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used <b>the</b> <b>built-in</b> multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard. This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed. The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial. Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the MP4 (with H.264 video) or WebM (with VP8 video) formats could play the videos, and not all videos on the site were available.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{comes with}} several pre-installed applications, {{including}} Safari, Mail, Photos, Videos, YouTube, Music, iTunes, App Store, Maps, Notes, Calendar, Game Center, Photo Booth, and Contacts. Like all iOS devices, the iPad can sync content {{and other data}} with a Mac or PC using iTunes, although iOS 5 and later can be managed and backed up without a computer. Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network, users can use a headset or <b>the</b> <b>built-in</b> speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi-Fi or cellular using a VoIP application, such as Skype. The device has dictation, using the same voice recognition technology as the iPhone 4S. The user speaks and the iPad types what they say on the screen provided that the iPad is connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network.|$|E

5|$|The iPad 2 {{comes with}} several {{applications}} by default, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, Music, iTunes (store), Maps, Notes, Calendar, Photo Booth, and Contacts. The App Store {{is also available}} as a default application, it enables users to download from a database of 800,000 applications, the price of these applications is set by the developers. Like all iOS devices, the iPad 2 can sync music, videos, apps and photos with a Mac or PC using iTunes, although when using iOS 5 and later, the user {{does not have to}} connect the iPad to the computer. iCloud also allows users to backup and sync their data with other compatible iOS devices via the internet. Game Center is available as a native social gaming platform on iOS, games downloaded via the App Store that have this feature enabled are able to integrate their achievement points, high-scores and bonus system across all iOS devices into a single accumulative points and social platform.

5|$|Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook {{follows the}} same design first {{seen in the}} MacBook Pro; however, it is rounder on the edges than {{previous}} laptops in the MacBook line. This model has an all-white fingerprint-resistant glossy palm rest, unlike the grayish surface of its predecessor, and uses a multi-touch glass trackpad like the one found on the MacBook Pro. The video-out port is Mini DisplayPort. The bottom of the MacBook features a rubberized non-slip finish. <b>The</b> <b>built-in</b> battery of the late 2009 revision, a feature introduced {{earlier in the year}} with the MacBook Pro, is claimed by Apple to last seven hours compared with five hours in the older models. However, in tests conducted by Macworld, the battery was found to last only about four hours while playing video at full brightness with AirPort turned off. However, Apple's battery life was calculated with the brightness at the middle setting and while browsing websites and editing word documents, not with video and at full brightness. Gizmodo also reached about the same conclusion in their tests, but with AirPort turned on. The battery included in the mid-2010 model holds an additional five watt-hours over the previous model's and is claimed to last up to ten hours.|$|E
