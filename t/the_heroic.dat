5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended the}} game {{to have a greater}} sense of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with <b>the</b> <b>heroic</b> X-Men to defeat a greater threat.

5|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century has often been called <b>the</b> <b>Heroic</b> Age of polar exploration.

5|$|With {{the first}} row of tablets {{complete}}, Mary Watts and <b>the</b> <b>Heroic</b> Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee decided to complete the next row as soon as possible. The Committee selected 24 names, 22 proposed by Watts before his death and two from press reports of 1905, and DeMorgan was duly commissioned to produce the new set of tablets.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, the story of <b>the</b> <b>heroic</b> past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he {{laid the groundwork for}} the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E

5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, <b>the</b> <b>heroic</b> theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 <b>the</b> <b>Heroic</b> Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee had {{suggested}} to Mary Watts that public funds be raised {{to complete the}} memorial, but she objected and promised to complete the 120 tablets at her own cost or provide funds in her will to do so. However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund the project, as she was devoting her time and money to the Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery in Compton.

5|$|Lad: A Dog is a 1962 American drama film {{based on}} the 1919 novel {{of the same name}} written by Albert Payson Terhune.

Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for the novel from Vanguard Productions, and acquired the film rights for the other two Lad novels from the late Terhune's wife.|$|E
5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing <b>the</b> <b>heroic</b> atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Eh! pray let me {{be present}} when you perform the ceremony! Cilla in <b>the</b> <b>heroics!</b> Whom is she expecting?' said a voice outside the door, ever ajar, a voice that made Lucilla clasp her hands in ecstasy.|$|R
5|$|Sunderland's next outing {{in a major}} final came in 1992 when, as a Second Division club, they {{returned}} to the FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat of <b>the</b> <b>heroics</b> of 1973, as Sunderland lost 2–0 to Liverpool.|$|R
