5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of <b>tumorigenesis</b> to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated <b>tumorigenesis</b> differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.|$|E
25|$|Amon's {{research}} has investigated how cells control and organize the segregation of their chromosomes during cell division. More specifically, her research examines {{the regulation of}} exit from mitosis, the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle, and effects of aneuploidy on normal physiology and <b>tumorigenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{a report}} was {{published}} that recorded {{the first ever}} discovered malignancies in two naked mole-rats, in two individuals. However, both naked mole-rats were captive-born at zoos, and hence lived in an environment with 21% atmospheric oxygen compared to their natural 2–9%, which may have promoted <b>tumorigenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cancer occurs after {{cells are}} genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This {{uncontrolled}} proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour. The cells which constitute the tumor eventually undergo metaplasia, followed by anaplasia then dysplasia, {{resulting in a}} malignant phenotype. This malignancy allows for invasion into the circulation, followed by invasion to a second site for <b>tumorigenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Federal Research Centre for Nutrition in Germany {{reported}} that consuming L. bulgaricus on regular basis {{is associated with}} anticarcinogenic effects, one mechanism {{of which is the}} detoxification of genotoxins in the gut. This mechanism was shown experimentally in animals with use of the rat colon carcinogen, with endpoints that ranging from <b>tumorigenesis</b> to induction of DNA damage.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{importance}} of both Ras and B-Raf mutations in <b>tumorigenesis,</b> several Raf inhibitors were developed to combat cancer, especially against B-Raf exhibiting the V600E mutation. Sorafenib was the first clinically useful agent, that provides a pharmacological alternative to treat previously largely untreatable malignacies, such as renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Several other molecules followed up, such as Vemurafenib, Regorafenib, Dabrafenib, etc.|$|E
25|$|Ependymomas are tumors {{arising from}} the ependyma, an epithelium-like tissue of the central nervous system. In {{patients}} with NF2 and ependymomas, the tumor suppressant function of Merlin may be compromised. Loss of function mutations occurring in chromosome 22q, where Merlin proteins are coded, can promote <b>tumorigenesis,</b> or {{the creation of new}} tumorous cells. Deletions, too, in the NH2-terminal domain of merlin proteins have been associated with early tumor onset and poor prognosis in affected patients.|$|E
25|$|MUTYH encodes DNA {{repair enzyme}} MYH glycosylase. During normal {{cellular}} activities, guanine sometimes becomes altered by oxygen, which causes it to pair with adenine instead of cytosine. MYH glycosylase fixes these mistakes by base excision repair, such that mutations do not accumulate in the DNA {{and lead to}} tumor formation. When MYH glycosylase does not function correctly, DNA errors may accrue to initiate <b>tumorigenesis</b> with a clinical presentation {{similar to that in}} patients with APC mutations.|$|E
25|$|GAPDH is overexpressed in {{multiple}} human cancers, such as cutaneous melanoma, and its expression is {{positively correlated with}} tumor progression. Its glycolytic and antiapoptotic functions contribute to proliferation and protection of tumor cells, promoting <b>tumorigenesis.</b> Notably, GAPDH protects against telomere shortening induced by chemotherapeutic drugs that stimulate the sphingolipid ceramide. Meanwhile, conditions like oxidative stress impair GAPDH function, leading to cellular aging and death. Moreover, depletion of GAPDH has managed to induce senescence in tumor cells, thus presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling tumor growth.|$|E
25|$|The best {{understood}} galectin {{in terms of}} cancer is galectin-3. Evidence suggests that galectin-3 plays a considerable part in processes linked to <b>tumorigenesis,</b> including transformation to a malignant form, metastasis and increased invasive properties of tumour cells. There is some significant evidence that galectin-3 is involved in cancer since it interacts with oncogenes such as Ras and activates downstream signalling that promotes proliferation. It can also regulate some of the proteins of the cell cycle, such as cyclin E and c-myc, which may give it additional tumorigenic properties.|$|E
25|$|DNAzyme {{research}} {{for the treatment of}} cancer is also underway. The development of a 10-23 DNAzyme that can block the expression of IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factor I, a contributor to normal cell growth as well as <b>tumorigenesis)</b> by targeting its mRNA could be useful for blocking the secretion of IGF-I from prostate storm primary cells ultimately inhibiting prostate tumor development. Additionally, with this treatment it is expected that hepatic metastasis would also be inhibited, via the inhibition of IGF-I in the liver (the major source of serum IGF-I).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{regulatory}} role during transcription of epigenetic modifications in genes, {{it is not}} surprising that changes in epigenetic markers, such as acetylation, can contribute to cancer development. HDACs expression and activity in tumor cells is very different from normal cells. The overexpression and increased activity of HDACs has been shown to be characteristic of <b>tumorigenesis</b> and metastasis, suggesting an important regulatory role of histone deacetylation on oncogene expression. One of the examples is the regulation role of histone acetylation/deacetylation in P300 and CBP, both of which contribute to oncogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The novel domain {{additions}} to aaRS genes are accretive and progressive up the Tree of Life. The strong evolutionary pressure for these small non-catalytic protein domains suggested their importance. Findings beginning in 1999 and later revealed a previously unrecognized layer of biology: these proteins control gene expression within the cell of origin, and when released exert homeostatic and developmental control in specific human cell types, {{tissues and organs}} during adult or fetal development or both, including pathways associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, the immune response, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, apoptosis, <b>tumorigenesis,</b> and interferon gamma (IFN-) and p53 signalling.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{chromatin}} structure also {{promise to}} shed light on transcriptional regulation in melanoma cells. It has long been assumed that nucleosomes are positioned randomly on DNA, but murine studies of genes involved in melanin production now suggest that nucleosomes are stereotypically positioned on DNA. When a gene is undergoing transcription, its transcription start site is almost always nucleosome-free. When the gene is silent, however, nucleosomes often block the transcriptional start site, suggesting that nucleosome position {{may play a role in}} gene regulation. In addition to genetic mutations, evidence demonstrates that epigenetic events (e.g. loss of DNA hydroxymethylation 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) also play roles in melanoma <b>tumorigenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carcinogenesis, {{also called}} {{oncogenesis}} or <b>tumorigenesis,</b> is {{the formation of}} a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. The process is characterized by changes at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels and abnormal cell division. Cell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost all tissues and under a variety of circumstances. Normally the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, in the form of apoptosis, is maintained to ensure the integrity of tissues and organs. According to the prevailing accepted theory of carcinogenesis, the somatic mutation theory, mutations in DNA and epimutations that lead to cancer disrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the processes, upsetting the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and the evolution of those cells by natural selection in the body. Only certain mutations lead to cancer whereas the majority of mutations do not.|$|E
25|$|The Hedgehog Signaling pathway is {{critical}} in proper tissue patterning and orientation during normal development of most animals. Hedgehog proteins induce cell proliferation in certain cells and differentiations in others. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in several types of cancers, Basal Cell Carcinoma in particular. This uncontrolled activation of the Hedgehog proteins {{can be caused by}} mutations to the signal pathway, which would be ligand independent, or a mutation that causes overexpression of the Hedgehog protein, which would be ligand dependent. In addition, therapy-induced Hedgehog pathway activation {{has been shown to be}} necessary for progression of Prostate Cancer tumors after androgen deprivation therapy. This connection between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and human cancers may provide for the possible of therapeutic intervention as treatment for such cancers. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is also involved in normal regulation of stem-cell populations, and required for normal growth and regeneration of damaged organs. This may provide another possible route for <b>tumorigenesis</b> via the Hedgehog pathway.|$|E
25|$|Cancer is {{the result}} of somatic {{mutations}} which provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. Recently it has been very important to determine the novel mutations. Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes. Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly. Protein–protein interaction networks provide valuable information on <b>tumorigenesis</b> in humans. Cancer proteins exhibit a network topology that is different from normal proteins in the human interactome. Immunoinformatics have been useful in increasing success of tumour vaccination. Recently, pioneering works have been conducted to analyse the host immune system dynamics in response to artificial immunity induced by vaccination strategies.. Other simulation tools use predicted cancer peptides to forecast immune specific anticancer responses that is dependent on the specified HLA.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{mutations}} in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT (also known as protein kinase B) pathway have been identified in MCAP and MPPH. This pathway has proven to {{be an integral part of}} brain growth and development and is an area of interest to many researchers who study the cause of megalencephaly. Mutations in this pathway have been shown to cause a gain of function in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. This cellular pathway is critical in the regulation of diverse cell functions including, cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, <b>tumorigenesis</b> and most importantly in regards to megalencephaly, brain development. AKT is a crucial signaling molecule part of the PI3K pathway and is also involved in many cellular functions. These functions include, brain development, synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment. Loss of function in AKT can cause microcephaly in humans while inactivation of the pathway can cause hemimegalencephaly. There are also several cancers that have been shown to be linked with mutations in the AKT pathway, including melanoma and lung cancer.|$|E
500|$|A homolog of FLCN called DBHD {{has been}} {{discovered}} in the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Decrease expression of the DBHD results in loss of male germline stem cells (GSC), which suggest that DBHD is required for male GSC maintenance in the fly testis. Further, DBHD regulates GSC maintenance downstream or in parallel of the JAK/STAT and Dpp signal-transduction pathways, which suggest that BHD regulates <b>tumorigenesis</b> by controlling stem cells in human { Singh et al. 2006} ...|$|E

NEDD9 is rarely if ever mutated, but frequently show altered expression or phosphorylation (associated with increased activity) in pathological conditions including immune cell dysfunction and cancer. [...] NEDD9 overexpression is documented to occur {{and in some cases}} linked the process of <b>tumorigenesis</b> of many different malignances. [...] Besides examples in breast cancer discussed above, these malignancies include colon, pancreatic, head and neck, ovarian, gastric, lung, genitourinary (including prostate), liver, and kidney cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, glioblastoma, and neuroblastoma.|$|E

2500|$|DNA damages {{can also}} be caused by {{endogenous}} (naturally occurring) agents. [...] Macrophages and neutrophils in an inflamed colonic epithelium {{are the source of}} reactive oxygen species causing the DNA damages that initiate colonic <b>tumorigenesis,</b> and bile acids, at high levels in the colons of humans eating a high fat diet, also cause DNA damage and contribute to colon cancer.|$|E
2500|$|... miR-122 {{levels are}} {{frequently}} reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to normal liver, and low miR-122 levels correlate with poor prognosis. Overexpression of miR-122 reduces tumorigenic properties in HCC cell lines, {{suggesting that it}} functions as a tumor suppressor gene, and increases the response of cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs sorafenib and doxorubicin. Several miR-122 target genes have been implicated in <b>tumorigenesis,</b> including ADAM10, IGF1R, CCNG1 and ADAM17.|$|E
2500|$|All insulin analogs must {{be tested}} for carcinogenicity, as insulin engages in {{cross-talk}} with IGF pathways, which can cause abnormal cell growth and <b>tumorigenesis.</b> [...] Modifications to insulin always carry the risk of unintentionally enhancing IGF signalling {{in addition to the}} desired pharmacological properties. There has been concern with the mitogenic activity and the potential for carcinogenicity of glargine. Several epidemiological studies have been performed to address these issues. Recent study result of the 6.5 years Origin study with glargine have been published.|$|E
2500|$|Changes in {{chromosome}} number {{may not necessarily}} be present in all cells in an individual. [...] When aneuploidy is detected in a fraction of cells in an individual, it is called chromosomal mosaicism. [...] In general, individuals who are mosaic for a chromosomal aneuploidy tend to have a less severe form of the syndrome compared to those with full trisomy. [...] For many of the autosomal trisomies, only mosaic cases survive to term. [...] However, mitotic aneuploidy may be more common than previously recognized in somatic tissues, and aneuploidy is a characteristic of many types of <b>tumorigenesis</b> (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Epigenomics is {{the study}} of the {{complete}} set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the epigenome. [...] Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell’s DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence (Russell 2010 p.475). [...] Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. [...] Epigenetic modifications {{play an important role in}} gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and <b>tumorigenesis.</b> [...] The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays.|$|E
2500|$|An {{examination}} {{of the differences in}} gene expressed between the H19 transfected cells and the antisense H19 transfected cells showed that the following genes were upregulated: uPar, c-src kinase, tyrosine kinase 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, tyrosine kinase 2, c-jun, JNK1, [...] Janus kinase 1, TNF-a, interleukin-6, heparin-binding growth factor-like growth factor, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, NF-κB, ephrin A4 and ezrin. It is also suggested that angiogenin and FGF18 may be potential transcriptional targets of the H19 RNA. As a result of the functions and signaling pathways that H19 RNA-upregulated genes are involved in, {{it has been suggested that}} H19 RNA plays crucial roles in tissue invasion, migration and angiogenesis in <b>tumorigenesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary role}} of TNF {{is in the}} {{regulation}} of immune cells. TNF, being an endogenous pyrogen, is able to induce fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, inflammation and to inhibit <b>tumorigenesis</b> and viral replication and respond to sepsis via IL1 & IL6 producing cells. [...] Dysregulation of TNF production has been implicated {{in a variety of}} human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, major depression, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Though controversial, studies of depression and IBD are currently being linked to TNF levels. [...] Recombinant TNF is used as an immunostimulant under the INN tasonermin. TNF can be produced ectopically in the setting of malignancy and parallels parathyroid hormone both in causing secondary hypercalcemia and in the cancers with which excessive production is associated.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{mutation}} is sporadically detected due to {{its small}} size ( [...] < 1kb). The appearance of certain specific mtDNA mutations (264-bp deletion and 66-bp deletion in the complex 1 subunit gene ND1) in multiple types of cancer provide some evidence that small mtDNA deletions might appear {{at the beginning of}} <b>tumorigenesis.</b> It also suggests that the amount of mitochondria containing these deletions increases as the tumor progresses. An exception is a relatively large deletion that appears in many cancers (known as the [...] "common deletion"), but more mtDNA large scale deletions have been found in normal cells compared to tumor cells. This may be due to a seemingly adaptive process of tumor cells to eliminate any mitochondria that contain these large scale deletions (the [...] "common deletion" [...] is > 4kb).|$|E
2500|$|A study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether early exposure to BPA could accelerate mammary carcinogenesis in a dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) model of rodent mammary cancer. In the study, scientists exposed neonatal/prebubertal rats to BPA via lactation from nursing dams treated orally with 0, 25, and 250µg BPA/kg body weight/day. [...] For <b>tumorigenesis</b> studies, female offspring were exposed to 30mg DMBA/kg body weight at 50 days of age. [...] DMBA induces mammary tumors and allows chemicals that predispose for mammary cancer {{to increase the number}} of mammary adenocarcinomas. [...] The results of the study showed that female rats in the control, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups administered DMBA exhibited a BPA dose-dependent increase in mammary tumors. [...] The groups had 2.84, 3.82, and 5.00 mammary tumors per rat respectively. [...] Treatment with BPA also reduced tumor latency, with the median tumor latency of 65, 53, and 56.5 days for 0, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups respectively. [...] Maternal exposure to BPA during lactation decreased time to first tumor latency and increased the number of DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female offspring. [...] If these effects found in rodents carry over to humans, even minimal exposure to BPA could cause an increased risk for breast cancer.|$|E
