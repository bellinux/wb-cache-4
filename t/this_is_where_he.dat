5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford. It {{had been his}} wish, however, to be buried at the family's traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was finally buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may {{have been inspired by}} a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|Growing up, Bueno {{worked as}} a paperboy at the {{newsstand}} of his grandmother, Hortensia. In 1984, he attended concerts of the local band Chébere and was occasionally invited to join them on stage. The next year, {{he dropped out of}} school and started working at his father's record shop, where he sometimes sang for the customers. A friend of his father belonged to the local band Manto Negro and offered Rodrigo a spot in the band. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> formally started his career in music, signing his first contract and earning his first salary as a musician at age thirteen. Bueno had written songs since the age of ten, but he would not show them to his colleagues because of his grammar mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Hardy {{lived in}} a house in Avenue Road, which bears a blue plaque {{recording}} that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wrote A Pair of Blue Eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Noel sat down; {{but as he}} loosed her wrist, she laughed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{sat with}} Leila, where they would sit when she was gone. [...] "It's awfully funny, isn't it?" [...] she said.|$|R
50|$|Young Serocee {{lived with}} his {{extended}} family {{while he was in}} Jamaica and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had his first real exposure to Reggae music. From this point on, his lasting love affair with music was born.|$|R
5|$|Tavares {{was born}} on September 20, 1990 in Mississauga, Ontario, to Barbara and Joe Tavares, who are of Polish and Portuguese descent, respectively. His {{maternal}} grandparents Bolesław and Josephine Kowal immigrated from Poland to Sudbury, Ontario, and his paternal grandparents Manuel and Dorotea Tavares immigrated from Portugal to Toronto, Ontario. At a very young age, Tavares moved to Oakville, Ontario. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was first exposed to minor hockey via the Minor Oaks Hockey Association. Tavares also played soccer and lacrosse, and his highly competitive nature often led him to fight with other players. Tavares excelled at lacrosse, {{following in the footsteps}} of his uncle John Tavares, the all-time scoring leader in the National Lacrosse League (NLL), and was a ball boy for his uncle's NLL team, the Buffalo Bandits. The younger Tavares credits his uncle with teaching him the importance of remaining unselfish, stating that what he learned by following his uncle with the Bandits has made him better both as a person and a hockey player. Many skills he learned in lacrosse—such as spinning off checks and battling in traffic—transferred to ice hockey and improved Tavares' abilities as a goal scorer.|$|E
25|$|Steinman {{grew up in}} New York City, New York, and {{was raised}} {{in the shadows of the}} Brooklyn Bridge. The Williamsburg Bridge was {{constructed}} as he grew up. The late Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries were a time of significant bridge construction in the area, and he later said <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> got his first interest in bridges.|$|E
25|$|Carsten Refstrup Pedersen (born 18 May 1977) is a Danish cricketer. Pedersen is a {{right-handed}} batsman who bowls right-arm off break. He {{was born}} at Herning, Ringkjøbing County. His brother, Michael, has also played for and captained Denmark. Carsten also had a stellar 1996-97 season with Australian Sub-District club Brighton. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> met his long time idol, Robbie Dunball, a sublime wicket keeper with a questionable batting technique.|$|E
50|$|Klopfer, a Jew, left Germany in 1933; {{and on his}} way to the USA, spent a year in Switzerland <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{studied with}} Carl Jung at the Zurich Psychotechnic Institute (<b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> first {{encountered}} the Rorschach test).|$|R
5000|$|... The tabulating {{business}} {{most interested}} Watson, {{perhaps because it}} was closest to his NCR experience. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> directed much of his attention and by the early 1930s this had indeed become the largest piece of CTR.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Kansas City, Kansas, the son of Croatian parents who had immigrated to the United States a few years before. He {{graduated}} from Wyandotte High School in 1937. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> first became interested in dramatics.|$|R
25|$|In 967, {{he went to}} Catalonia {{to visit}} the Count of Barcelona, and {{remained}} {{three years in the}} monastery of Vic, in Catalonia which, like all Catalans Monasteries, contained manuscripts from the Muslim Spain and especially from Cordoba, one of the intellectual centres of Europe at that time: the library of Al-Hakam II, for example, had thousands of books (from Science to Greek philosophy). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was introduced to mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
25|$|Swift was {{the ninth}} of 12 {{offspring}} born to William Swift and Sally Crowell, descendants of British settlers {{who went to}} New England in the 17th century. The family (which included Gustavus’ brothers Noble and Edwin) lived and worked {{on a farm in}} the Cape Cod town of West Sandwich, Massachusetts (present-day Sagamore), where they raised and slaughtered cattle, sheep, and hogs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> got the idea of packing meat.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Butcher {{purchased}} 14 {{acres in}} Big Cypress National Preserve in Southern Florida that {{is surrounded by}} over a million acres of wilderness. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> built his gallery and home. He then realized {{that he needed to}} help the public to understand the beauty of the swamp and began leading guided tours through the swamp behind his gallery in Big Cypress National Preserve. Big Cypress Gallery is open seven days a week from 10:00 - 5:00.|$|E
5000|$|In 1822 Gérard {{enrolled}} at the collège Charlemagne. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> met and befriended Théophile Gautier. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> also <b>where</b> <b>he</b> began to take poetry more seriously. He was especially drawn to epic poetry. At age 16, he wrote a poem that recounted the circumstances of Napoleon's defeat called [...] "". Later, he tried out satire, writing poems that took aim at Prime Minister Villèle, the Jesuit order, and anti-liberal newspapers like La Quotidienne. His writing started {{to be published in}} 1826.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 and 2007 Abbott {{played his}} cricket for an English seaside town Clevedon Cricket Club which {{played in the}} West of England Premier League - Bristol Somerset. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{recognized}} by Somerset CCC and represented their second team.|$|R
50|$|Rhodes' Cottage is a {{small house}} on the seafront that Cecil Rhodes bought as a holiday cottage and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> died in 1902. The house is {{preserved}} as a museum dedicated to Rhodes' life and {{is open to the}} public.|$|R
25|$|As the Ui Fidgenti {{were the}} ruling clan in the Limerick after 400 a.d., the Uí Fidgenti still made a {{substantial}} {{contribution to the}} population of the central and western regions of County Limerick. Their capital was Dún Eochair, the great earthworks of which still remain and can be found close to the modern town of Bruree, on the River Maigue. Bruree is a derivation of Brugh Righ, or Fort of the King. Catherine Coll, the mother of Éamon de Valera, was a native of Bruree and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was taken by her brother to be raised.|$|E
500|$|In November 1995, Queen {{released}} Made in Heaven, {{an album}} featuring Mercury's previously unreleased final recordings from 1991—as well as outtakes from previous years and reworked versions of solo {{works by the}} surviving members. The album cover features the Freddie Mercury statue that overlooks Lake Geneva superimposed with Mercury's Duck House lake cabin that he had rented. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had written and recorded his last songs at Mountain Studios. The sleeve of the album contains the words, [...] "Dedicated to the immortal spirit of Freddie Mercury." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Gogh's {{early works}} {{were made with}} dull, gray colors. In Paris, he met leading French artists Edgar Degas, Georges Seurat and others who {{provided}} illuminating influences {{on the use of}} color and technique. [...] His work, previously somber and dark, now [...] "blazed with color." [...] Indeed, van Gogh's use of color became so dramatic that he was sometimes called an Expressionist. But it was southern France that provided an opportunity for him to express his [...] "surging emotions." [...] Enlightened by the effects of its sun-drenched countryside, van Gogh reported that above all, his work [...] "promises color". [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> began development of his masterpieces.|$|E
50|$|Rodolfo Biagi (March 14, 1906, in Buenos Aires - September 24, 1969) was an Argentine Tango {{musician}} who started his musical career by playing background music for silent movies, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> first discovered by a tango band leader.|$|R
5000|$|Antony Szeto {{visited the}} set on day {{two of the}} shoot. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{discovered}} Trung Ly and mentioned {{that if he was}} to direct the next project, that he will be on board. That project turned into Roger Corman's [...] "Fist of the Dragon".|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, Hayman was {{the manager}} of the Beverly Hilton hotel. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> met Gale, who was working there as a {{cocktail}} waitress, and was also a divorcee. She was arrested for working underage; Hayman provided bail and they married a year later. He was sixteen years older than she.|$|R
2500|$|While Van Gogh {{learned much}} about color and {{technique}} in Paris, southern France {{provided an opportunity}} to express his [...] "surging emotions." [...] Enlightened by {{the effects of the}} sun drenched countryside in southern France, Van Gogh reported that above all, his work [...] "promises color." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> began development of his masterpieces.|$|E
2500|$|... 1930 – [...] {{he nearly}} always {{stepped back to}} meet the ball with a {{vertical}} bat. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had his limitations, for the tour proved that when he met a bowler either left-hand or right who could make the ball just go away he never seemed quite such a master as against off-break or straight fast bowling. A glorious driver, he hit the ball very hard, while his placing was almost invariably perfect. He scored most of his runs by driving... only on rare occasions did he lift it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1895, after {{receiving}} a Master of Science degree from Wabash and [...] teaching there, he went at Smith's invitation to the University of Chicago for a teaching appointment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was first exposed to the principle he later used in a charcoal gas mask. It {{was part of his}} duties to set up experiments on the lecture tables. [...] In an effort to find a demonstration that would seem especially dramatic, he turned to a little used one from a well-known source-book, G. S. Newth's Chemical Lecture Experiments.|$|E
50|$|Villeneuve {{took over}} third place when Schumacher {{made the first}} of his stops, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> stayed to the finish. By the end, Villeneuve was {{catching}} the McLarens because Häkkinen had not taken on enough fuel at his stop, and the Finn had to slow down to reduce his fuel consumption.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925, {{the area}} was partly owned by TK Pringle, and he named the inland portion Banner Rest as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wished to [...] "strike his banner". The village was laid out and was named Port Edward in honour of the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{non-native}} settler in the Town of Freedom was James Andrew Jackson, an African-American {{who arrived}} in 1830. Jackson was asked by town residents if they could name the town [...] "Jackson" [...] after him, but he wanted the town to be named Freedom because <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> obtained his freedom.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1930s, {{the debate}} society {{was subject to}} 'The Quimby Institute' which pitted each and every debate student against Brooks Quimby himself. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> began to engage heated debate with them that {{stressed}} [...] "flawless assertions" [...] and resulted in every error made by the student to be carefully scrutinized and teased. Bates has an annual and traditional debate with Oxford, Cambridge and Dartmouth College. It competes in the American Parliamentary Debate Association domestically, and competes in the World Universities Debating Championships, internationally. As of 2013, the debate council was ranked 5th, nationally and in 2012, the debate team was ranked 9th in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Daugherty {{frequently}} attended [...] "uptown" [...] and [...] "downtown" [...] {{new music}} concerts in New York City; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> became acquainted with composers such as Milton Babbitt, Morton Feldman, and Pierre Boulez. [...] In 1978, Boulez, then the Music Director of the New York Philharmonic, invited Daugherty {{to apply to}} his recently opened computer music institute in Paris: IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique). [...] A Fulbright Fellowship enabled Daugherty to move to Paris to study computer music at IRCAM from 1979-80. [...] During his time at IRCAM, he met many composers such as Luciano Berio, Gérard Grisey, Tod Machover, and Frank Zappa. [...] In Paris, Daugherty {{had the opportunity to}} hear contemporary music by the leading European composers of the time performed by the Ensemble l'Itinéraire and [...] Boulez’s Ensemble InterContemporain. [...] He also attended analysis classes given by Betsy Jolas at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July, Butler {{exited the}} {{sessions}} leaving Dog Man Star {{some distance from}} completion. Anderson had recorded {{little more than a}} string of guide vocals; several songs did not have titles; much of the music was still to be embossed with overdubs. One notable song, [...] "The Power" [...] did not feature the guitarist and had to be played by a session guitarist instead. Anderson and Buller admitted that the song suffers from his absence. Buller and the remaining members succeeded in taking the record to its conclusion. Butler did finish some of his guitar parts, however he refused to do it at Master Rock and instead used another studio where he could work on his own. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> made a contractual contribution to [...] "Black or Blue". Anderson discovered a covert backing vocal on the song, which he recalled: [...] "I can't remember the exact words but it sounded vaguely threatening." [...] Among the post-Butler additions was a reworked ending to [...] "The Wild Ones", replacing the four minute extended outro; an orchestral coda on [...] "Still Life" [...] and an electric guitar part, copied directly from Butler's original demo of [...] "The Power", which he strongly criticised. Butler became a harsh critic of the album, not just from a production standpoint, but the overall musicianship.|$|E
50|$|Dansey {{first started}} his journalism career when he {{completed}} an apprenticeship with the Hawera Star, {{before moving on}} to become editor and part-owner of the Rangitikei News. His family then moved to New Plymouth <b>where</b> <b>he</b> took up a position with the Taranaki Daily News. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> started his cartoon-drawing for multiple newspapers.|$|R
50|$|While {{admitting to}} feeling homesick at first, Wenninger quickly made friends and, after a year, knew that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> needed to <b>be.</b> He {{was a student}} in {{a section of the}} prep school that functioned as a “minor seminary” - later moving on into St. John’s <b>where</b> <b>he</b> studied {{philosophy}} and theology, which led into the priesthood.|$|R
