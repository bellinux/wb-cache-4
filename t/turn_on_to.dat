5|$|After World War I the {{memorial}} {{became one of}} the centerpieces of the Adelaide Anzac Day march. The route for the march starts at the National War Memorial, heads west along North Terrace, and turns right down King William Road before culminating in a service at the Cross of Sacrifice (in the Adelaide Park Lands opposite the St Peter's Cathedral). As the marchers <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> King William Road they salute the South African War Memorial.|$|E
25|$|The Porsche 911 Turbo hit an {{oncoming}} Volkswagen Golf, which {{was making a}} left <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the main road from a side road and driving {{in the opposite direction}} of the Porsche. The Porsche hit the Golf head-on, and the crash pushed both vehicles off the road.|$|E
25|$|Anti-clockwise {{direction}} from the M25, the main carriageway continues directly on to the M26 at junction 5. To remain on the M25, traffic must <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the slip road which connects to the M25 spur coming north from Sevenoaks, which is multiplexed with the A21. The awkwardness of junction 5 {{is a result of}} the history of the two motorways' planning and construction.|$|E

50|$|One of the wig-wag's {{solenoids}} is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> engage agitation during wash mode; {{the other}} solenoid is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> engage the spin-dry mode. The motor must be <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> before the solenoids are powered. Only one solenoid may be operated at a time. When neither solenoid is engaged, the transmission is in neutral {{and only the}} pump is operating to drain {{water out of the}} tub.|$|R

25|$|A {{stick shaker}} is a device (available in some {{hydraulic}} aircraft) that {{is attached to}} the control column, which shakes the control column when the aircraft is about to stall. Also in some aircraft like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 there is/was a back-up electrical power supply that the pilot can <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> re-activate the stick shaker in case the hydraulic connection to the stick shaker is lost.|$|E
2500|$|During normal operation, the {{containment}} is air-tight and access is only through marine style airlocks. High air temperature and {{radiation from the}} core limit the time, measured in minutes, people can spend inside containment while the plant is operating at full power. In {{the event of a}} worst-case emergency, called a [...] "design basis accident" [...] in NRC regulations, {{the containment}} is designed to seal off and contain a meltdown. Redundant systems are installed to prevent a meltdown, but as a matter of policy, one is assumed to occur and thus the requirement for a containment building. For design purposes, the reactor vessel's piping is assumed to be breached, causing a [...] "LOCA" [...] (loss Of coolant accident) where the water in the reactor vessel is released to the atmosphere inside the containment and flashes into steam. The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs. The safety systems close non-essential lines into the air-tight containment by shutting the isolation valves. Emergency Core Cooling Systems are quickly turned on to cool the fuel and prevent it from melting. The exact sequence of events depends on the reactor design.|$|E
6000|$|According to {{the tale}} of Henriques, {{confirmed}} by what they had learned otherwise, the great procession of the Act of Faith would <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the quay at about eight o'clock, and pass along it for a hundred yards or so only, before it wound away down a street leading to the plaza where the theatre was prepared, the sermon would be preached, the Mass celebrated, and the [...] "relaxed" [...] placed in cages to be carried to the Quemadero.|$|E

60|$|He obeyed, being a skilful whip enough who, as he {{informed}} me afterwards, had {{been accustomed to}} drive a four-in-hand at home. Mounting my horse, which stood by, I guided the cart out of the wood and down the slope beyond, till at length we came to our old outspan where I proposed to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the wagon track which ran to Pilgrim's Rest. I say proposed, for when I looked up it I perceived about five hundred yards away a number of armed Basutos running towards us, the red light of the sunset shining on their spears. Evidently the scout or spy to whom Rodd whistled, had called {{them out of their}} ambush which they had set for us on the Pilgrim's Rest road in order that they might catch us if we tried to escape that way.|$|E

5000|$|Turn on is {{accomplished}} by a [...] "positive current" [...] pulse between the gate and cathode terminals. As the gate-cathode behaves like PN junction, {{there will be some}} relatively small voltage between the terminals. The turn on phenomenon in GTO is however, not as reliable as an SCR (thyristor) and small positive gate current must be maintained even after <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> improve reliability.|$|E
