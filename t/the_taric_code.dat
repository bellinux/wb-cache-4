This includes {{the provisions of the}} harmonised system and the combined nomenclature but also additional provisions specified in Community legislation such as tariff suspensions, tariff quotas and tariff preferences, which exist {{for the majority of the}} Community’s trading partners. In trade with third countries, the 10-digit Taric code must be used in customs and statistical declarations.|$|E

50|$|Introduction of Harmonized System code in 1990s {{has largely}} {{replaced}} the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), though SITC remains in use for statistical purposes. In drawing up the national tariff, the revenue departments often specifies {{the rate of}} customs duty {{with reference to the}} HS code of the product. In some countries and customs unions, 6-digit HS codes are locally extended to 8 digits or 10 digits for further tariff discrimination: for example the European Union uses its 8-digit CN (Combined Nomenclature) and 10-digit <b>TARIC</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

30|$|For Cd and its compounds, various {{restrictions}} {{already exist}} in Annex XVII of REACH (entry 23, e.g., Cd in plastics); however, {{there is no}} entry for Cd in artists’ paints covered by <b>TARIC</b> <b>code</b> (Tarif Intégré de la Communauté) 3213. The pigments used for artists’ paints are PY 35, PO 20, and PR 108 (pigment yellow, pigment orange, and pigment red) and consist of cadmium zinc sulfide CdxZn(1 −x)S (PY 35) and cadmium seleno sulfide CdS(1 −x)Se(x) (PO 20 and PR 108). According to information of CEPE, the European association of paint, printing ink and artists’ colors companies, 39 tons artists’ paints with Cd pigment are sold annually in Europe. The average content of Cd pigments in artists’ paints ranges from 12.1  % in acrylics and some 35  % in oil and water-based paints [17]. Acrylics have the highest market share in terms of quantity with 79  %, followed by oil (14  %), water paints, and gouache (7  %). The Cd quantity in artists’ paints sold in Europe was specified with 6357  kg per annum [17].|$|R
50|$|Building of TARIC was {{originally}} conceived after securing {{a grant from}} the The World Islamic Call Society, following which purchase of 2.2 acre of land was completed in 1977. However, it was to take well over a decade to accumulate the necessary additional funds {{for the construction of a}} building. The current building structure was completed and opened to public in 1991, and is in fact only the first of a two-phase complex of a much larger building. <b>The</b> <b>TARIC</b> building houses a library, a gymnasium and the main prayer hall. With a full-time imam, weekend classes on Arabic and the basics of the Islamic religion are taught, as well as dawah programs and dialogue with local community and neighbourhood organizations.|$|R
40|$|The article {{present the}} {{comparison}} of the Pb-isotope study of antimony-ores from important Sb-mineralisation of Western Carpathian: from Tatric unit (Pezinok, Kuchyňa, Pernek, Dúbrava, Magurka, Lom, Trangoška, Jasenie, Kriváň deposits and occurrences), Gemeric unit (Helcmanovce, Grexa and Poproč deposits) and from Eastern Slovakian neovolcanites (Zlatá Baňa). The study is compared with results of previous investigations of affiliated galena mineralisation. The lead is of a crustal origine. <b>The</b> lead from <b>Taric</b> and that from Gemeric unit (and Eastern Slovakian Neovolcanites) seems {{to be derived from}} different reservoirs...|$|R
50|$|Tariq ibn Ziyad (died 720), {{known in}} Spanish history and legend as Taric el Tuerto (<b>Taric</b> <b>the</b> one-eyed), was a Berber Muslim and Umayyad general {{who led the}} conquest of Visigothic Hispania in 711. He is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important military commanders in Spanish history. He was initially the deputy of Musa ibn Nusair in North Africa, and was sent by his superior to launch the first thrust of an invasion of the Iberian peninsula. Some claim that he was invited to intervene by the heirs of the Visigothic King, Wittiza, in the Visigothic civil war.|$|R
