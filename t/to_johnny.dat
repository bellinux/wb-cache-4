5|$|The 1926 World Series {{was also}} known for Ruth's promise <b>to</b> <b>Johnny</b> Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy.

The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he would hit a home run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital.

Richie was replaced by Clem Burke from Blondie, which was disbanded at the time. According <b>to</b> <b>Johnny,</b> the performances with Burke—who adopted the name Elvis Ramone—were a disaster.

Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself.

5|$|During this time, Juggernaut also competed as a singles wrestler. On September 12, 1999, he {{defeated}} Michelle Starr {{to win the}} NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship.

The promotion soon folded, but Stock signed with MainStream Wrestling (MSW) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she debuted in August 2002 and continued to wrestle as Sweet Sarah. There were few female wrestlers in the area, so she worked in several matches against male wrestlers.|$|E
