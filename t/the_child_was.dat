His mother gave him a third name, shisanyazi ("the Third Child Named Stone"), which reflected that he was her third child while also protecting him from misfortune and linking to the protection offered by Guanyin.|$|E

5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which is somewhat undermined {{by the fact that the}} latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> only one year old.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{children}} of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of the birth of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her horoscope. Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E

5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate son {{in the summer of}} 1800.

Historians are divided on the validity of these stories, as some believe she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family's political enemies.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{connection}} of his wife's uncle, Conroy {{came to the attention}} of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Conroy was appointed as an equerry in 1817, shortly before the Duke's marriage to Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. An efficient organiser, Conroy's planning ensured the Duke and Duchess' speedy return to England in time for the birth of their first child. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, later Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|When Sharp campaigned in 1825 {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives, opponents {{revived the}} story of his alleged illegitimate child by Cooke.

In the early morning of November 7, 1825, he tricked Sharp to open the door at his home in Frankfort, and fatally stabbed him.|$|E

5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from the bones of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E

5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an illegitimate child. Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
5|$|Having visited Bath, in {{the hope}} its waters would aid conception, Queen Mary became {{pregnant}} in late 1687. When the pregnancy became public knowledge shortly before Christmas, Catholics rejoiced. Protestants, who had tolerated James's Catholic government {{because he had no}} Catholic heir, were concerned. The Protestant disillusion came to a head after <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> known to be male, and many Protestants believed <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> spurious; if not, James II's Catholic dynasty would have been perpetuated. Popular opinion alleged that the child, named James Francis Edward, was smuggled into the birth chamber as a substitute to the Queen's real but stillborn child. This rumour was widely accepted as fact by Protestants, despite the many witnesses of the birth. Mainly by mismanagement on James' part, these rumours had some excuse as from personal prejudice he had excluded many from the ceremony whose testimony must have been counted valid; most of the witnesses were Catholics or foreigners, and several, such as the Princess Anne of Denmark, later to be Queen Anne, and the Protestant prelates, or the family of the Princesses whom the new birth would remove from the direct succession, were not allowed to be present. Anne later answered a memorandum of 18 questions regarding James Francis Edward's birth for her sister, the Princess of Orange. Anne's answers, biased and unreliable, convinced the Princess of Orange that her father had thrust a changeling upon the nation. Count Zuylestein, returning to the Netherlands shortly after the birth, agreed with Anne's findings.|$|E

50|$|Child auction (Barnauktion, Huutolaisuus) was a {{historical}} practice in Sweden and Finland during the 19th and early 20th Century, in which orphan and poor <b>children</b> <b>were</b> boarded out in auctions. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> {{handed over to}} the person asking least money from the authorities. The compensation was determined in descending English auctions, where <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> present. <b>The</b> lowest bidder became <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> foster-parent and <b>was</b> compensated with an annual amount equal to his bid. The foster-parents provided <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>the</b> housing, upbringing and education, but <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> often used as a child labour. Specially in the Finnish countryside <b>the</b> <b>children</b> sold in <b>the</b> auctions usually lived in a slavery-like conditions. They were also mistreated.|$|R
5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, {{or whether it was}} a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E

In July 2013, the South Carolina trial court finalized {{the adoption of the}} child to the adoptive couple, but this was prohibited in August by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
