5|$|The general {{election}} of 2006 was a landmark election {{because of the}} prominent {{use of the internet}} and blogging to cover and comment on the election, circumventing the official media. The PAP returned to power, winning 82 of the 84 parliamentary seats and 66% of <b>the</b> <b>votes.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, Wee Kim Wee and Devan Nair, two former Presidents, died.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent years, {{there has been a}} drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%.|$|E
5|$|Behind <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> {{parliament}} was {{a personal}} antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris, {{the leader of the}} LCL in the Legislative Council. DeGaris, who was elected to the council in 1962, was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries. The two were the de facto leaders of the party's two factions; Hall represented the urban-based progressives, and DeGaris the rural-based conservatives. The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level, contributing to the polarisation of views within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be reached on the issue of electoral reform.|$|E
5000|$|Young was re-elected with {{at least}} 55% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> all of <b>the</b> {{subsequent}} seven elections. He defeated former State Senator Eben Hopson with 71% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 1976, State Senator Patrick Rodey with 55.41% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 1978, Kevin [...] "Pat" [...] Parnell with 73.79% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 1980 and Dave Carlson with 70.84% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 1982.|$|R
50|$|In the 2000s, Peterson never faced {{a serious}} {{re-election}} challenge and only once did he win re-election {{with less than}} two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 2000, he was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate against Republican Rod Grams, but he chose to run for re-election, winning with 69% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 2002, he won with 65% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, he won with 66% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, he won with 70% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, he won with 72% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{election}} was won by Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, who polled 56.8% of <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> the head-to-head {{second round of}} voting over Conservative MP for Richmond Park, Zac Goldsmith. Goldsmith was more than 25% ahead of the next candidate {{in the first round}} of voting, as part of a record field of twelve candidates. Of the twelve candidates only Khan, Goldsmith, and Green Party candidate Siân Berry achieved the requisite 5% minimum first round vote share to retain their deposit.|$|E
5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E
5000|$|...- Bill Morton, of Danforth Avenue, elected with 48% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 2012. Re-elected with 49% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 2016.|$|R
50|$|She first {{ran for the}} Alaska's 21st House District in 1996. She lost by {{just one}} <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary to former State Representative Ann Spohnholz. In 1998, she ran again and won the primary with 47% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> general election, she {{defeated}} incumbent Republican State Representative Joe Ryan 53%-47%. In 2000, she won re-election to a second term with 54% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 2002 after redistricting, she decided {{to run in the}} newly redrawn Alaska's 22nd House District.

50|$|Grondin was re-elected with 63% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2007 {{election}} (defeating Liberal Claude Drouin) {{and with}} 50% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 2008 election.|$|R
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|Later in that year, the {{collaboration}} between monarch and premier, {{coupled with the}} fact that Tătărescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu — the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> elections. (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.) Tătărescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.|$|E
5|$|Mari Kiviniemi {{was elected}} {{the new leader}} of the Centre Party in its conference in Lahti on 12 June. The support for the Centre Party has been {{significantly}} higher in northern Finland than elsewhere: in the 2007 election the party received over 43% of <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> both Oulu and Lapland electoral districts, compared with its nationwide support of 23.1%, while in 2003 the party's vote share in the two northernmost districts was even higher) As the top spots of the party leadership went to members from southern Finland, many of their supporters {{in the northern part}} of the country felt disenchanted; one local party chief even warned that many northern Centre Party supporters might switch sides to the True Finns.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Ferrand ran for Finistère's 6th {{constituency}} {{under the}} PS banner. He lost to Christian Ménard who achieved 50.19% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 2012, Ferrand {{ran in the}} same constituency for PS where he got 32.2% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round and then 58.3% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second round.|$|R
50|$|One-term {{incumbent}} Governor Lolo Letalu Matalasi Moliga ran for re-election. Moliga {{was elected}} in 2012 with 52.9% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second round, after taking 33.5% of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round.

5|$|On February 13, the Kentucky House {{achieved}} a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day. Having lost {{the battle against}} the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination. They believed that a double primary {{would be too much}} for the aging Beckham to endure. Supporters of a single primary found they did not have <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.|$|E
