40|$|The {{application}} of <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> on civil transport aircraft {{has only been}} studied by a few individuals. Quantified investigations need {{to be carried out}} to search for the potential benefits of the {{application of}} <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> on a civil transport aircraft. Blended Wing Body configuration is a novel aircraft concept. Due to the absence of conventional tails longitudinal controllability become part of the key challenges of this configuration. It is therefore the objective of this thesis project to carry out quantified flight mechanics analyses on the effectiveness of controlling a Blended Wing Body aircraft with <b>vectoring</b> <b>thrust.</b> As a starting point flight mechanics simulations under steady level flight conditions in longitudinal plane are conducted in this project. Through this project a <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> model, which contains the calculation of nozzle deflection angles based on nozzle deflection controls and the calculation of engine thrust loss due to nozzle deflections, is developed and embedded in a flight mechanics toolbox used for the flight mechanics simulations. The flight mechanics simulations of <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> are then carried out with a series of nozzle deflections, flight conditions, aircraft mass and CG locations. From the simulation results it is investigated that for the Blended Wing Body configuration tested in this project, <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> under steady level flight conditions is much less effective than the conventional aerodynamic control surfaces. The maximum effectiveness ratio between <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces obtained in this project is about 11. 2 %. With extensive flight mechanics simulations, the way that aircraft flight conditions, mass and CG locations affect the effectiveness of <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> is analysed through this project.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{emphasizes}} the challenging problem of rapid maneuvering flight control and specifically {{concentrated on the}} velocity vector roll maneuver. The development of automatic flight control system for rapid aircraft maneuvering requires nonlinear and coupled modeling. For that purpose a nonlinear compact, twin engine multi-axis <b>thrust</b> <b>vector</b> <b>controlled,</b> fighter aircraft model is built. The model includes the coupled Newtonian kinematics/dynamics, nonlinear aerodynamics, engine and <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> paddles, and, sensor models. The nonlinear controller design is based on time scale separation between the velocity vector orientation angles and the body angular velocity components. The controller is designed to command the desired velocity vector attitude angles and conduct the angle of attack, side slip angle stabilization/control features. This is effectively done by blending the aerodynamic and <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> effectors. The performance of the proposed velocity vector roll controller is simulated in a velocity vector roll maneuver scenario and demonstrated for the mentioned fighter aircraft model...|$|R
