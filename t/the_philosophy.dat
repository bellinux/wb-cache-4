The new department started with four people: Stratton as chair; Edward Chace Tolman, with a Harvard degree, and an initiator of rodent experiments soiling {{the rooms of}} <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> department and hastening the split of the psychology division; Brown, Stratton's earlier student and Berkeley faculty member from 1908 onward; and Olga Bridgman, the first Berkeley psychology PhD awardee, albeit from <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> department. Before the split Stratton had set up Berkeley's first psychology lab in <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> department and taught psychology courses with Brown. The courses included sensation, perception, emotion, memory, and applications of psychology to professions such as law, medicine, schooling and clerical work by priests.|$|E

The second entails {{the examination of the}} concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of mind and psychopathology.|$|E

There are two {{subjects that}}, in connection with <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of the mind, have aroused special attention: free will and the self.|$|E
