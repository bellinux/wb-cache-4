50|$|When {{making a}} direct deposit {{by means of}} {{electronic}} funds transfer, <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> would also normally enter reference information to enable the payee to easily recognise who made the deposit and which account to credit. The reference may be an account number, an invoice number, <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> <b>name,</b> or some other meaningful identification. To ensure that the payee is aware of <b>the</b> deposit, <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> would commonly follow up by sending to the payee a remittance advice.|$|R
50|$|Austria: bribes {{justified}} by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> <b>names</b> <b>the</b> recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.|$|R
50|$|A {{negotiable}} instrument is a document guaranteeing {{the payment of}} a specific amount of money, either on demand, or at a set time, with <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> <b>named</b> on <b>the</b> document. More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a contract, which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term can have different meanings, depending on what law is being applied and what country it is used in and what context it is used in.|$|R
50|$|If {{you receive}} a “B” notice from a payer, notifying {{you that the}} TIN you gave is incorrect, you usually can prevent backup {{withholding}} from starting or stop backup withholding once it has begun by giving <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> your correct <b>name</b> and TIN. You must certify that the TIN you give is correct. If you receive a second “B” notice from that payer, {{you will need to}} provide <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> with verification of your TIN from the Social Security Administration or the IRS.|$|R

The amount can be paid into any bank account, which need not belong to an organisation vetted by <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> bank.|$|R
50|$|In Poland, {{direct debit}} is {{operated}} by KIR (Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa) and participating banks {{as one of}} the functionalities of the Elixir clearing system. <b>The</b> <b>payer</b> has to authorize the payee by filling, signing and submitting a standarized paper form in two copies. One copy, after filling in payee details and a customer identification number, is sent by the payee to <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> bank, which verifies the signature. From now on, the payee may debit <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> account. Since 24 Oct 2012 it is also possible to submit such authorization through <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> bank, often also online.|$|R
50|$|The {{other method}} {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> to instruct {{his or her}} bank to honour Direct Debit notes from the payee. The payee is then notified {{that he or she}} is now authorised to initiate Direct Debit transfers from <b>the</b> <b>payer.</b> While this is more secure in theory, it can also mean for <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> that it is harder to return debit notes in the case of an error or dispute.|$|R
50|$|One method {{involves}} only <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> and <b>the</b> payee, with <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> authorizing <b>the</b> payee {{to collect}} amounts due {{on his or}} her account. However, <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> can instruct his or her bank to return any Direct Debit note without giving a reason. In that event, the payee has to pay all fees for the transaction and may eventually lose his or her ability to initiate Direct Debits if this occurs too often. However, it still requires all the account holders (not merely <b>the</b> <b>payer)</b> to watch statements and request returns if necessary, unless they have instructed their bank to block all Direct Debits.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the three-party contracting problem among <b>the</b> <b>payer,</b> <b>the</b> {{patient and the}} physician when {{the patient and the}} physician may collude to exploit mutually beneficial opportunities. Under the hypothesis that side transfer is ruled out, we analyze the mechanism design problem when the physician and the patient submit the claim to <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> through a reporting game. To induce truth telling by the two agents, the weak collusion-proof insurance payment mechanism is such that it is sufficient that one of them tells the truth. Moreover, we identify trade-offs of a different nature faced by <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> according to whether incentives are placed on the patient or the physician. We also derive the optimal insurance scheme for the patient and the optimal payment for the physician. Moreover, we show that if <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> is able to ask the two parties to report the diagnosis sequentially, the advantage of the veto power of the second agent allows <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> to achieve <b>the</b> first-best outcome...|$|R
5000|$|... "Float {{is money}} in the banking system that is counted twice, for a brief time, because of delays in {{processing}} checks or any transfer of cash", {{as defined by the}} Reserve Banks of United States. It is most obvious in the time delay between a cheque being written and the funds to cover that cheque being deducted from <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> account. Once <b>the</b> payee or recipient of a cheque deposits it in a bank account, the bank provisionally credits the account and thus increases the payee's account in demand deposit, assuming that <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> bank will ultimately send the funds to cover the cheque. Until <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> bank actually sends <b>the</b> funds, both <b>payer</b> and payee have the [...] "same" [...] money in both of their accounts. Once the payee's bank notifies <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> bank by presenting the cheques, the [...] "duplicate" [...] funds will be removed from <b>the</b> <b>payer's</b> account, and <b>the</b> cheques will be considered to have [...] "cleared" [...] the bank.|$|R
50|$|If {{you are a}} {{non-resident}} of Canada and {{you have}} taxable earnings in Canada (e.g. rental income and property disposition income) you {{will be required to}} pay Canadian income tax on these amounts. Rents paid to non-residents are subject to a 25% withholding tax on the “gross rents”, which is required to be withheld and remitted to Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) by <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> (i.e. <b>the</b> Canadian agent of the non-resident, or if there is no agent, the renter of the property) each time rental receipts are paid or credited to the account of the non-resident by <b>the</b> <b>payer.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> does not remit the required withholding taxes by the 15th day following the month of payment to <b>the</b> non-resident, <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> will be subject to penalties and interest on the unpaid amounts.|$|R

50|$|This first {{transaction}} for a {{claim for}} services is known technically as X12-837 or ANSI-837. This contains {{a large amount of}} data regarding the provider interaction as well as reference information about the practice and the patient. Following that submission, <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> will respond with an X12-997, simply acknowledging that the claim's submission was received and that it was accepted for further processing. When the claim(s) are actually adjudicated by <b>the</b> <b>payer,</b> <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> will ultimately respond with a X12-835 transaction, which shows the line-items of the claim that will be paid or denied; if paid, the amount; and if denied, the reason.|$|R

50|$|To set up {{payments}} by Direct Debit, <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> must {{complete a}} Direct Debit Instruction to the merchant.

5000|$|A {{direct debit}} {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> authorize <b>the</b> payee take a direct debit for any amount at any time, or to instruct {{the bank to}} honour direct debit requests from a specified payee.

They can vary the amount and frequency of payments without further authorisation from the customer (subject to providing the customer with the required advance notice). [...] <b>The</b> <b>payer</b> has no direct control over these payments, but can cancel the direct debit at any time, with no reason required, and require the return of disputed payments.

40|$|In {{a variant}} of the {{electronic}} cash protocol, an electronic coupon protocol, a withdrawn coin is divided into many sub-coins whose face values are fixed in advance, and the sub-coins are only used in payments. The original coin is called ticket and the sub-coins are called sub-tickets. The electronic cash protocol should satisfy not only the anonymity that <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> cannot be traced from the payments, but also the unlinkability. The unlinkability means that anyone cannot determine whether payments were made by <b>the</b> same <b>payer.</b> If <b>the</b> unlinkability does not hold, tracing <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> from one payment leads to tracing <b>the</b> <b>payer</b> from all his/her payments, and the link between the payments also facilitates the de-anonymization.

40|$|Abstract Health {{insurance}} reform requires political solutions, not technocratic fixes. Single <b>payer</b> frames <b>the</b> problem as a grossly inefficient bursar’s office.

Single <b>payer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>name</b> isn’t pretty, and nobody knows exactly what it looks like, but liberal health policy advocates love it anyway. The {{only way to make}} sense of the Left’s infatuation with this unprepossessing idea is to understand its role in American health politics. Since the late 1970 s, the American health policy establishment has been on a campaign to reduce health insurance, on the dubious theory that when people don’t have to pay the full cost of their medical care, they use too much. Deductibles, co-payments, high-deductible plans, medical savings accounts, and coverage limits are all techniques for shrinking insurance and shifting the costs of medical care back to individuals. In spite of the ritual hand-wringing when the Census Bureau releases its ever-mounting annual tally of the uninsured, the United States has been moving farther away from insuring everyone and closer to the free-market, each-person-pays-for-himself style of health care. In this political context, where policy makers blame insurance as the root cause of all that’s wrong with the American health care system, singl...|$|R
