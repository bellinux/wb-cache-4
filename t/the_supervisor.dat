5|$|When the Jones Beach State Park Authority {{was given}} the loan by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in March 1933, a toll was planned for both the Meadowbrook Causeway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway to help repay the loan.

5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
5|$|Prizes {{were awarded}} {{for the best}} structures, the best art posters, and the best cutout books made by {{students}} about Tiny Town.

The carpentry of the framing and exterior of the homes was done primarily by the boys. <b>The</b> <b>supervisor</b> of the art department of the participating schools had an interior home-decoration contest to involve the girls, who made draperies, furniture, and floor coverings and beautified the homes' interiors.|$|E
30|$|We {{carried out}} {{in-depth}} interviews {{with students and}} their supervisors in 2013 and 2014 in two phases. <b>The</b> <b>supervisors</b> responded to an email asking for expressions of interest and then <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> recommended their students. A separate expression of interest email was sent to their students. <b>The</b> <b>supervisors</b> and students who volunteered {{to participate in the}} study signed the relevant consent forms.

50|$|Like {{many other}} modern militaries, the {{specialist}} corps forms {{the backbone of}} the military.

30|$|Hence, the {{commitment}} to reduce the effort of <b>the</b> central <b>supervisor</b> in <b>the</b> hierarchical supervision setup is welfare improving. The intuition is that {{a reduction in the}} effort of <b>the</b> central <b>supervisor</b> forces <b>the</b> local <b>supervisor</b> to increase its (cheaper) effort. However, the model assumes that the efforts of <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> are not verifiable, so there is an issue about how this could be implemented. One obvious way to move in this direction would be to limit the size of <b>the</b> central <b>supervisor.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{information}} available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in Cernavodă, {{as well as}} the results of scientists in France, say that the myths are pure fiction. First of all the Romanian government never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavodă Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, fulfilling the design of Anghel Saligny, which was also <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> of the site. In these conditions, not knowing if the contract will be approved, it is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria–Hungary {{there was no need to}} construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.|$|E
5|$|Diver Rodney Joyce from Scarborough, Ontario, aged 18, {{drowned in}} a slow {{whirlpool}} effect in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. Joyce had been swimming for ten minutes, when he went closer to the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother Gregory, aged 20, rushed to help him, but was pulled under several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's director of engineering denied {{the existence of an}} undertow. A nearby life ring had been tied to a tree using three knots and was only equipped with 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach the middle of the pool. One high diver, who had worked at the park for seven years, claims to have told his supervisor of the undertow during the previous season. That diver was concerned about landing someone, as he claimed unauthorized swimmers were a frequent occurrence at that time. The area was listed as barricaded in an early report, but later reports contradicted that. The witness claimed that there were 30 to 40 bathers at one time. The park's director of safety and security said he was never informed of the undertow, and only saw bathers in the pool on one occasion. Not only was there no statement about pool dangers on record, but <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> for the previous three years denied that anyone in their department had expressed concern. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Spokespeople pointed out that Joyce shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area and suggested that the witness shouldn't have continued to work for the park in the previous season if they had an unaddressed concern.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Because {{personal}} assistance {{is relatively new}} in social care in Sweden {{we were interested in}} to get more knowledge in how supervisors for personal assistants worked. In our study we choosed to look into how <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> worked with <b>the</b> physical work environment for the personal assistants. The questions we wanted to found answers for in this study was, which work directions <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> for personal assistants have around the physical work environment, which legal provisions there were around the physical work environment for the personal assistants and how <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> experienced <b>the</b> work with the physical work environment for the personal assistants. We did a qualitative interview study with supervisors for personal assistants. We realised in our study that there were big differences in how <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> for personal assistants worked with the physical work environment for the personal assistants. The result indicated that the differences were because <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> didn’t have any guidelines but the legal provisions that handle the physical work environment for personal assistants. An idea for further studies would be to find out if <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> for personal assistants that had used guidelines around the work with the physical work environment experienced that the guidelines made the work easier...|$|R
