5|$|An {{example of}} this is <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> perception. Scientists working in this field have {{discovered}} general principles of the perception of forms. A law of <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed.

Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

5|$|Taylor {{provides}} {{background on}} the development of the term brainwashing, from its use in 1950 by journalist Edward Hunter and its later usage as applied to the spheres of cults, marketing, influence, thought reform, torture, and reeducation. She references psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton's work Thought Reform and <b>the</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> Totalism as a resource throughout the book. Lifton based his research on interviews he conducted with prisoners of war who had been subjected to indoctrination and torture during the Korean War. Taylor argues that the term brainwashing is useful to when used to refer to a more coercive form of persuasion.|$|E

5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In <b>The</b> <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E

25|$|Bartlett's studies {{relating}} to the nosology of mental illness and his critique of the assumption that psychological normality should be equated with good mental health led him to examine <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> creative individuals. <b>The</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> artists and other highly creative people has been studied from the diagnostic perspective of DSM's psychiatric classification of mental disorders, {{with the result that}} some outstanding creative individuals may be considered to have various degrees of psychopathology. Bartlett has argued that this is not only short-sighted, but it questionably presumes that <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> normality should serve as arbiter for mentally healthy emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive characteristics and abilities. In a group of further publications, Bartlett has described in detail how it is possible to enrich and deepen our understanding of both <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> creativity and <b>the</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> normality.|$|E
