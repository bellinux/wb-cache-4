5|$|In October 2013, hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger {{issued a}} {{cease and desist}} letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for {{allegedly}} using two of his songs without authorisation. American television personality Karen Gravano of the reality television programme Mob Wives filed suit against Rockstar Games in February 2014 in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> foreclosed by the First Amendment. In July, actress Lindsay Lohan also filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes. In 2016, both lawsuits were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Garrity’s {{attorney}} refuted the claim, saying <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> to help Davis inflate {{his share}} holdings {{for a greater}} profit.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, {{stockholders}} of Apollo Education Group filed {{a class-action}} {{lawsuit against the}} corporation, arguing that the company withheld information that led to significant losses in stock prices. Several of <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> related to University of Phoenix's recruiting of military personnel and veterans.|$|E
25|$|Cisco {{denied the}} {{allegations}} in a customer document saying that no information was included about specific Cisco products, supply chain intervention or implant techniques, or new security vulnerabilities. Cisco’s General Counsel also claimed that Cisco {{does not work}} with any government, including the United States Government, to weaken its products. <b>The</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> reported to have prompted the company’s CEO to express concern to the President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{merits of}} <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> {{impossible}} to judge, although {{it seems clear}} that Archer was acquainted with Cahill. The assassination plot was just one of many against the queen that received credence during the final decade of her reign. One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England. The book does appear to have alarmed Elizabeth's advisers, and from that date onward the flow of supposed plots against the queen's life became steady. In 1601 Cecil himself was accused of treason at the trial of the Earl of Essex {{on the basis of his}} reading of Person's book, but survived this twist and went on to secure the succession of James I upon the queen's death two years later.|$|E
5000|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>allegations</b> (and denials) {{that serious}} {{complaints}} and sexual assault <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> not investigated properly. Batmanghelidjh has claimed that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> [...] "completely invalid".|$|R
50|$|The spouse that is {{responsible}} for committing these <b>allegations</b> <b>is</b> required to confirm the correct date and place that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> committed. <b>The</b> reason for the spouse to confirm <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>is</b> to show proof that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> have taken place in the same state. The state then has to have the authority to administer justice by hearing and determining the controversies. Different states accept different grounds for divorce. For example, some states only accept no-fault divorce where other states accept both fault and no-fault grounds for divorce.|$|R

500|$|Captain Peune, who had {{commanded}} the bomb-ship chartered to ferry Thompson {{and his staff}} from Corfu to Trieste, {{wrote a letter to}} answer the charges of pillage. He stated that the 30-men French prize crew was unarmed, having had to swim to Leander because all the boats on Généreux and Leander had been destroyed in the battle, and that the 200 men still able on Leander would have stopped them from plundering their effects; that neither the captain not the surgeon of the ship had complained at Corfu nor at Trieste; and that on his ship, he had seen Thompson with three trunks of personal effects, and the other members of his staff with their own as well. In his [...] Batailles navales de la France, Troude accuses William James of further [...] "augmenting" [...] the accusations originally published in the Gazette de Vienne. <b>The</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> not present in Thompson's account in The Gentleman's Magazine.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> that MPS {{officers}} 'made or concurred with inaccurate {{public statements}} concerning {{the circumstances of}} the death.

2500|$|Another {{company that}} has been {{identified}} as having ties to the illegal timber trade in Madagascar is Flavour Handling LLC.

2500|$|Several Republican {{leaders said}} that Moore should step aside if <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> true. [...] Prominent Republicans such as John McCain and Mitt Romney called for Moore {{to drop out}} of the race after <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> reported. Alabama Republicans have largely defended Moore from these accusations. [...] For example, Alabama state Auditor Jim Zeigler defended Moore's alleged actions on biblical grounds, and Alabama State {{representative}} Ed Henry advocated prosecuting the accusers criminally.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendant}} {{responds to}} <b>the</b> plaintiff’s <b>allegations</b> in a document called an answer, {{in which the}} defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state {{that he or she}} does not know if <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> <b>is</b> true, in which case <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> <b>is</b> taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff’s claims even if <b>the</b> plaintiff’s <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.|$|R
2500|$|On 27 January 2011, Yunus {{appeared}} {{in court in}} a food-adulteration case filed by the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) Food Safety Court, accusing him of producing an [...] "adulterated" [...] yogurt whose fat content was below the legal minimum. This yogurt is produced by Grameen Danone, a social business joint venture between Grameen Bank and Danone that aims to provide opportunities for street vendors who sell the yogurt and to improve child nutrition with the nutrient-fortified yogurt. According to Yunus's lawyer, <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> [...] "false and baseless". At the request of Yunus's lawyers, pointing procedural irregularities and errors, this case is now considered by the High Court.|$|E
2500|$|The co-president of The Greens–European Free Alliance {{group in}} the European {{parliament}} Rebecca Harms (Germany) announced that she will insist {{on the order of}} the European Union on conducting an inspection of documents relating the [...] "gas affair" [...] against Tymoshenko. She believes that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> absurd and baseless. She reported that she recently familiarized herself with the results of investigation of the former Prosecutor General of Denmark, which indicate that Tymoshenko was not supposed to be convicted in this case. In her opinion the Ukrainian authorities and the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, have realized already that they are {{going in the wrong direction}} and that is why other criminal cases were opened against Tymoshenko.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, European {{parliamentary}} members protested to the Azerbaijani government {{when they}} were barred from inspecting the cemetery. Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian socialist MEP and committee member who was denied access to the region, commented that [...] "If they do {{not allow us to}} go, we have a clear hint that something bad has happened. If something is hidden we want to ask why. It can only be because some of <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> true." [...] Doctor Charles Tannock, a conservative member of the European Parliament for Greater London, and others echoed those sentiments and compared the destruction to the Buddha statues destroyed by the Taliban in Bamyan, Afghanistan in 2001. He cited in a speech a British architect, Steven Sim, an expert of the region, who attested that the video footage shot from the Iranian border was genuine.|$|E

50|$|Of <b>the</b> 11,000 <b>allegations</b> {{reported}} by bishops in the John Jay study, 3,300 were not investigated because <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> made after <b>the</b> accused priest had died. 6,700 <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> substantiated, leaving 1,000 {{that could not}} be substantiated.|$|R
2500|$|Voline, one of {{his biggest}} {{supporters}} who was active for several months in the movement, reports that Makhno and his associates engaged in sexual mistreatment of women: [...] "Makhno and of many of his intimates – both commanders and others... let themselves indulge in shameful and even odious activities, going as far as orgies in which certain women were forced to participate." [...] However, Voline's allegations against Makhno in regards to sexual violations of women has been disputed by some on the grounds that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> unsubstantiated, do not stand up to eyewitness accounts of the punishment meted out to rapists by the Makhnovists, and were originally made by Voline in his book The Unknown Revolution which was first published in 1947, long after Makhno's death and following a bitter falling-out between Makhno and Voline.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, a local amateur historian, Catherine Corless, {{published}} an article documenting the deaths of 796 babies and toddlers at the Home during its decades of operation. The report noted that the most commonly recorded causes of death among the infants were congenital debilities, infectious diseases and malnutrition (including marasmus-related malnutrition). The report claimed that the bodies were buried in a site at the Home {{and that there was}} a high death rate of its residents. Her research led her to conclude that almost all had been buried in an unmarked and unregistered site at the Home. The report noted that the site was also the location of a septic tank when overlaid with maps of the period of use as a workhouse. <b>The</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> being investigated by a statutory commission of investigation under Judge Yvonne Murphy - the [...] "Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haltzman {{filed an}} {{emergency}} motion seeking an injunction {{to prevent the}} school district from reactivating what he referred to as its [...] "peeping-tom technology". [...] The Pennsylvania chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) submitted an amicus brief {{in support of the}} student, arguing that the photo amounted to an illegal search. [...] Citing caselaw regarding privacy and unconstitutional searches, the ACLU's brief stated: [...] "While the act of placing the camera inside students' laptops may not implicate the Fourth Amendment, once the camera is used a search has occurred that, absent a warrant or consent, violates the Fourth Amendment (see United States v. Karo)." [...] Witold [...] "Vic" [...] J. Walczak, the ACLU of Pennsylvania Legal Director, said: [...] No government official, be it police officer or school principal, can enter a private home, physically or electronically, without an invitation or warrant. In this case, the officials are not just entering the foyer, but a child's bedroom. Assuming <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> true, this is an egregious invasion of privacy.|$|E

2500|$|The battle {{attracted}} widespread {{international attention}} due to allegations by Palestinians that a massacre had been committed. Reporters from various international media outlets quoted local residents who described houses being bulldozed with families still inside, helicopters firing indiscriminately into civilian areas, ambulances being prevented {{from reaching the}} wounded, summary executions of Palestinians, and stories of bodies being driven away in trucks or left in the sewers and bulldozed. Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian cabinet minister, accused the Israelis of {{trying to cover up}} the killing of civilians. The CNN correspondent noted that due to the IDF closure of the camp, there was [...] "no way of confirming" [...] the stories. During and immediately after the battle, the United Nations and several human rights NGOs also expressed concern {{about the possibility of a}} massacre. A British forensic expert who was part of an Amnesty International team granted access to Jenin on April 18 said, [...] "the evidence before us at the moment doesn't lead us to believe that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> anything other than truthful and that therefore there are large numbers of civilian dead underneath these bulldozed and bombed ruins that we see." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{report states}} that the [...] "credible allegations" [...] demand a serious {{investigation}} and the prosecution of those responsible. If <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> proved senior commanders, military and political, on both sides are liable for prosecution under international criminal law. The panel noted the Sri Lankan government's attempt at accountability consisted solely of investigating {{the actions of the}} previous government and the Tamil Tigers, and not of the present government's actions during the final stages of the war. The panel concluded this is not in accordance with international standards and fell [...] "dramatically short of international expectations". The panel found the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) established by the Sri Lankan government to be [...] "deeply flawed" [...] and not up to international standards of independence and impartiality due the [...] "deep-seated conflicts of interests" [...] of some of its members. The mandate of the LLRC, its work and methodology meant that it was incapable of investigating the serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law or of examining the causes of the civil war. The panel concluded that the LLRC could not satisfy the commitment on accountability given by President Rajapaksa and Ban Ki-moon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proceedings}} were to {{turn out}} to be lengthy involving: 20 separate hearings in the Magistrate's Court lasting 35 days in total, nine hearings in the Royal Court lasting 15 days, and three days in the Jersey Court of Appeal. Throughout the proceedings Syvret repeatedly complained that he was not being given relevant evidence by the prosecution. Matters came to head in October when Syvret submitted evidence to the court which he asserted proved that the 1999 police investigation had been a [...] "catastrophic failure". The prosecuting advocate argued indirectly that the quality of the investigation was not relevant. On 12 October 2009 the Magistrate stated [...] "I think the case would probably benefit from some clarity from both sides on exactly what <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> and what the defence is." [...] Syvret stated [...] " [...] it is abundantly clear that the 1999 investigation was in fact catastrophically defective, indeed far, far more so and more alarmingly so than even I originally thought.
