40|$|We {{focus on}} the impact of the removal of <b>trader</b> <b>identification</b> on the SFE limit order book. A number of {{electronic}} markets have recently introduced anonymous trading yet the literature suggests that the impact of this decision will not necessarily be optimal for the market. In analysis of this question {{it will be necessary to}} model the implicit, as distinct from the reported, spread because the current minimum price movements appear to have considerable impact on the reported spreads, particularly in the interest rate futures and futures options markets. Background and aims of project On 16 January 2004 the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) announced that in relation to its Australian interest rate products, all pre-trade mnemonics (or broker identifiers) would be removed from its trading system over the two days commencing Monday 23 rd February 2004. As a consequence of this change, traders would be unable to identify the party that had placed an order in the electronic limit order book that operates on the SFE. Further, participants would no longer have access to the identity of parties that had last bought/sold the contract of interest, nor receive suc...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} among the first market {{microstructure}} studies of an index futures market with designated market makers in the academic literature. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate intraday patterns of key variables, the relative size {{of the components of}} the quoted bid-ask spread, and the order decisions of uninformed traders, in a continuous dealer market for index futures with market makers. Overall, our findings aim to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the roles of market makers and public customers in price formation. Intraday patterns of financial market variables such as trade price, volume, trade size, quoted spreads, depth, and volatility separately for designated market makers and public customers are examined. The lack of relevant and appropriate data in futures markets, as evidenced by Hasbrouck (2003) and Kurov (2005), has inhibited the growth of market microstructure in futures markets. Individual orders, quotes, <b>trader</b> <b>identification,</b> and transactions from June 2003 to December 2004, for FTSEurofirst 80 and 100 index futures are used in the study. Inclusion of the parties to order execution distinguishes this data set from most other futures microstructure sources. As this thesis is the first known academic study of the extant market microstructure of the FTSEurofirst index futures, the institutional aspects of the trading process for the FTSEurofirst index futures are also explored. An alternative method for estimating three cost components as a proportion of the bid-ask spread is developed. A framework is developed for the order decision process of an uninformed trader for the first time in a futures market with market makers. The results of this thesis may have implications for other financial markets and the field of market microstructure...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we combine the tariff evasion {{analysis}} of Fisman and Wei (2004) with Rauch and Trindade’s (2002) study of Chinese trade networks. Chinese networks {{are known to}} act as trade catalysts by enforcing contracts and providing market information. As tariff evasion occurs outside the law, market information is scant and formal institutions inexistent, rendering networks the more important. We find robust evidence that Chinese networks, proxied by ethnic Chinese migrant populations, increase tariff evasion, i. e. the tariff semi-elasticity of Chinese missing imports. We suggest the effects takes place through matching of illicit-minded <b>traders,</b> <b>identification</b> of corrupt customs agents and enforcement of informal contracts. tariff evasion, China, illicit trade, migrant networks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the price discovery {{process in the}} S&P 500 and Nasdaq- 100 index futures contracts. By utilizing transactions data with attached <b>trader</b> type <b>identification</b> codes, this paper is able to analyze price discovery contributions of trades initiated by exchange locals and off-exchange customers. The empirical results show that price discovery appears to be initiated in the electronically traded E-mini index futures contracts and is driven by trades initiated by exchange locals. Furthermore, the information share of trades initiated by locals appears to be particularly pronounced {{in the beginning of}} the trading day when a large proportion of the daily price discovery takes place. Finally, results show that E-mini locals “front-run ” large trades that occur on the open outcry floor. We maintain that this trading technique at least partially explains the result of the price leadership of the E-mini contracts. Overall, the results are consistent with the notion that locals are informed traders who derive their informational advantage from the proximity to order flow...|$|R
