500|$|Cinema {{classified}} as [...] "fallen woman" [...] films was often inspired by real-life hardships women endured {{in the early}} Depression era workplace.

500|$|Del Toro and Soderbergh both {{attended}} the French premiere in late November 2008, where they took {{questions from the}} press. Del Toro remarked that the [...] "legendary rebel" [...] was still pertinent because [...] "the things that he fought for in the late 1950s and mid 1960s are still relevant today", adding that [...] "he did not hide behind curtains ... he stood up for the forgotten ones".

500|$|Many Simpsons {{staff members}} were fans of English comedian Ricky Gervais and his British comedy series The Office that he created and starred. In January 2004, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening called Gervais to congratulate {{him on his}} double Golden Globe win. During the phone call, Gervais was invited to lunch with Groening and {{executive}} producer Al Jean since they were big fans and wanted to meet him. At this lunch, he was offered a chance to appear in and write an episode of The Simpsons. Groening first asked Gervais for just a guest appearance, but {{came to the conclusion}} that he might be interested in writing an episode too. Gervais told The Independent that when he got the offer, [...] "well, I knew I had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>yes,</b> but fear kicked in at exactly the same time." [...] He became the first person to be credited with simultaneously writing and guest-starring in an episode of The Simpsons. He was also the first Briton to write an episode for the show.

500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>yes</b> to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E

[...] Middleton was compelled <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>yes.</b> There were allegations of wholesale honor code violations at the U. S. Military Academy in West Point, and Middleton was to serve on a committee to oversee the proceedings and make recommendations. [...] Though personally painful to Middleton, the committee's recommendation was to dismiss 82 cadets for cheating, including most {{of the members of the}} football team. A headline in a New Orleans newspaper wryly summarized the event as [...] "Army Football Team Severely Penalized for Illegal Passing." [...] While this was a drastic undertaking, the committee also recommended that the same tests not be given to different groups on different days, which practice offered the cadets a big temptation to cheat. [...] Though this was not a pleasant assignment for Middleton, he had been selected for the task because of his reputation for fairness. [...] Though he had never attended West Point, in 1952 he was asked to serve the academy on its Board of Visitors, a position which he held for one three-year term.|$|E

[...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>yes,</b> but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were here to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E

500|$|There are {{frequent}} references to Star Wars in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens. There is also reference to Star Wars when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In [...] "The Head and the Hair", Liz tells Jenna that [...] "The Head" [...] asked her out and says [...] "I had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>yes.</b> I mean he looked at me with those handsome guys eyes.

I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>yes</b> [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E
