500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E

As they all can ride, and, as you tell me, can all shoot, {{they ought to}} do really good service, and I should be well pleased if all my troop were {{composed}} of such good material. From <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> all speak Dutch, and most of you Kaffir, you will have great opportunities of obtaining information, and can, in case of need, pass as young Boers. In fact, I may say that there is some danger of your being mistaken for them by our men. I should take you for them myself, except that you all look brighter and more wide-awake than Boers generally do; but an artilleryman could hardly be blamed if he plumped a shell among you at a distance of two or three thousand yards." ...|$|E

60|$|B. And then, {{even if we}} {{know what}} the quarry bedding is, how are we to keep it always in our building? You may lay the stones of a wall {{carefully}} level, but how will you lay those of an arch? You think these, perhaps, trivial, or merely curious questions. So far from it, the fact that while the bedding in Normandy is level, that at Carrara is steep, and that the forces which raised the beds of Carrara crystallized them also, so that the cleavage which is all-important in the stones of my garden wall is of none in the duomo of Pisa,--simply determined the possibility of the existence of Pisan sculpture at all, and regulated the whole life and genius of Nicholas the Pisan and of Christian art. And, again, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> put stones in true bedding in a wall, but cannot in an arch, determines the structural transition from classical to Gothic architecture.|$|E
60|$|A {{portion of}} the city is pretty {{exclusively}} Turkish; the Jews have a quarter to themselves; the Franks another quarter; so, also, with the Armenians. The Armenians, of course, are Christians. Their houses are large, clean, airy, handsomely paved with black and white squares of marble, and in the centre of many of them is a square court, which has in it a luxuriant flower-garden and a sparkling fountain; the doors of all the rooms open on this. A very wide hall leads to the street door, and in this the women sit, the most of the day. In the cool of the evening they dress up in their best raiment and show themselves at the door. They are all comely of countenance, and exceedingly neat and cleanly; they look as if they were just out of a band-box. Some of the young ladies--many of them, I may say--are even very beautiful; they average a shade better than American girls--which treasonable words I pray may be forgiven me. They are very sociable, and will smile back when a stranger smiles at them, bow back when he bows, and talk back if he speaks to them. No introduction is required. An hour's chat at the door with a pretty girl one never saw before, is easily obtained, and is very pleasant. I have tried it. I could not talk anything but English, and the girl knew nothing but Greek, or Armenian, or some such barbarous tongue, but we got along very well. I find that in cases like these, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not comprehend each other isn't much of a drawback. In that Russia n town of Yalta I danced an astonishing sort of dance an hour long, and one I had not heard of before, with a very pretty girl, and we talked incessantly, and laughed exhaustingly, and neither one ever knew what the other was driving at. But it was splendid. There were twenty people in the set, and the dance was very lively and complicated. It was complicated enough without me--with me it was more so. I threw in a figure now and then that surprised those Russians. But I have never ceased to think of that girl. I have written to her, but I can not direct the epistle because her name is one of those nine-jointed Russian affairs, and there are not letters enough in our alphabet to hold out. I am not reckless enough to try to pronounce it when I am awake, but I make a stagger at it in my dreams, and get up with the lockjaw in the morning. I am fading. I do not take my meals now, with any sort of regularity. Her dear name haunts me still in my dreams. It is awful on teeth. It never comes out of my mouth but it fetches an old snag along with it. And then the lockjaw closes down and nips off a couple of the last syllables--but they taste good.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the years}} the number of {{rehabilitation}} robotics has grown {{but they are very}} limited due to the clinical trials. Many clinics have trials but do not accept the robots because they wish they were remotely controlled. Having Robots involved in the rehabilitation of a patient has a few positive aspects. One of the positive aspects is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> repeat the process or exercise as many times as you wish. Another positive aspect is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get exact measurements of their improvement or decline. You can get the exact measurements through the sensors on the device. While the device is taking a measurement you need to be careful because the device can be disrupted once it is done because of the different movements the patient does to get out. The rehabilitation robot can apply constant therapy for long periods. The rehabilitation robot is a wonderful device to use according to many therapists, scientists, and patients that have gone through the therapy. In the process of a recovery the rehabilitation robot is unable to understand the patient’s needs like a well experienced therapist would. The robot is unable to understand now but in the future the device will be able to understand. Another plus of having a rehabilitation robot {{is that there is no}} physical effort put into work by the therapist.|$|E

On the second view, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not execute your intention to φ is blameworthy because you violate a requirement of rationality.
