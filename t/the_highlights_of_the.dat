5|$|Kingdom Hearts was wildly successful, {{shipping}} {{more than}} four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited as one of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time. The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements. Kingdom Hearts was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of Kingdom Hearts in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven Kingdom Hearts games and Nintendo's Mario & Luigi series. She has also worked on many other projects, such as Heroes of Mana and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall.

5|$|The {{coronation}} of GeorgeVI in 1937 {{was broadcast}} on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), {{and parts of}} the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At ElizabethII's coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.|$|E
