60|$|Sakr-el-Bahr {{looked out}} to sea across the straits towards Tarifa and the faint distant European {{coastline}} just visible through the limpid summer air. But his glance was not concerned with that hazy horizon; it went no further than a fine white-sailed ship that, close-hauled, was beating up the straits some four miles off. A gentle breeze was blowing from the east, and with every foot of canvas spread to catch it she stood as close to it as was possible. Nearer she came on her larboard tack, and not a doubt but her master would be scanning the hostile African littoral for a sight of those desperate rovers who haunted it and who took toll of every Christian ship that ventured over-near. Sakr-el-Bahr smiled to think how little the presence of his galleys could be suspected, how innocent must look the sun-bathed shore of Africa to the Christian skipper's diligently searching spy-glass. And there from his height, like the hawk they had dubbed him, poised in the cobalt heavens <b>to</b> <b>plumb</b> <b>down</b> upon his prey, he watched the great white ship and waited until she should come within striking distance.|$|E
60|$|Yesterday {{he lived}} and moved, {{responsible}} {{to a thousand}} external influences, reflecting earth and sky in his small brilliant brain as in a looking-glass; also he had a various language, the inherited knowledge of his race, and the faculty of flight, by means of which he could shoot, meteor-like, across the sky, and pass swiftly from place to place, and with it such perfect control over all his organs, such marvellous certitude in all his motions, as to be able <b>to</b> drop himself <b>plumb</b> <b>down</b> from the tallest tree-top {{or out of the}} void air, on to a slender spray, and scarcely cause its leaves to tremble. Now, on this morning, he lies stiff and motionless; if you were to take him up and drop him from your hand, he would fall to the ground like a stone or a lump of clay--so easy and swift is the passage from life to death in wild nature! But he was never miserable.|$|R

40|$|IntroductionCaloric intake among {{children}} could be reduced if sugar-sweetened beverages were replaced by plain water.
