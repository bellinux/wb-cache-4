25|$|Alloparenting {{behaviour}} {{is frequently}} observed. Non-breeding and failed breeders show {{great interest in}} other chicks, and will attempt to brood or feed them. This activity is more common as the chicks get older and begin <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>their</b> ledge. There {{has also been a}} record of a pair managing to raise two chicks. Adults that have lost chicks or eggs will sometimes bring fish to the nest site and try to feed their imaginary chick.|$|E
25|$|While {{microscopy}} is {{a central}} tool in the documentation of biological specimens, it is, in general, insufficient to justify the description of a new species based on microscopic investigations alone. Often genetic and biochemical tests are necessary to confirm {{the discovery of a}} new species. A laboratory and access to academic literature is a necessity, which is specialized and, in general, not available to amateurs. There is, however, one huge advantage that amateurs have above professionals: time <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>their</b> surroundings. Often, advanced amateurs team up with professionals to validate their findings and (possibly) describe new species.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species are}} omnivorous, eating {{primarily}} small insects {{and all kinds}} of plant material and fungi; some are scavengers, feeding upon dead organisms, bird dung, and other fecal material. Such a broad range is unusual in other arachnids, which are typically pure predators. Most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey, although active hunting is also found. Because their eyes cannot form images, they use their second pair of legs as antennae <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>their</b> environment. Unlike most other arachnids, harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach or a filtering mechanism. Rather, they ingest small particles of their food, thus making them vulnerable to internal parasites such as gregarines.|$|E

According to Tim Rutten, [...] "His books are a {{stunning}} fusion of formal experimentation and supple, lyric prose. There is nothing like them anywhere in American letters. Though he sometimes was compared to the young John Dos Passos, Sanford's work was so original that it confounded critics and their categories -- probably to his professional detriment." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1965 R. D. Laing and {{his colleagues}} asked the Lesters {{for use of the}} Hall as a {{community}} for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result Kingsley Hall became home to the Philadelphia Association {{and one of the most}} radical experiments in psychiatry. Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness simply to be eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>their</b> madness and internal chaos. Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.|$|E
25|$|Lennox and Stewart met in 1975 in a {{restaurant}} in London, where Lennox worked at that time. They first played together in 1976 in the punk rock band The Catch. After releasing one single as The Catch in 1977, the band evolved into The Tourists. Stewart and Lennox were also romantically involved. The Tourists achieved some commercial success, but the experience was reportedly an unhappy one. Personal and musical tensions existed within the group, whose main songwriter was Peet Coombes, and legal wranglings happened with the band's management, publishers and record labels. Lennox and Stewart felt the fixed band line-up was an inadequate vehicle <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>their</b> experimental creative leanings and decided their next project should be much more flexible and free from artistic compromise. They were interested in creating pop music, but wanted freedom to experiment with electronics and the avant-garde.|$|E
25|$|The Owen School’s MBA {{degree program}} takes {{two years to}} {{complete}} and requires a minimum of 62 credit hours. The program is set up in eight modules (equal to four semesters) of full-time study. Students must take core courses in the fundamentals of management and complete them within their first year. MBA students may choose from the following career paths: finance, real estate, marketing, health care, human and organizational performance, operations, consulting, general management, entrepreneurship, or a custom career path. Then students must take courses in one concentration, one course in international business, and courses outside their primary concentration. In addition to earning an acceptable letter grade, students must complete a project before graduation. The approach to learning (ranked in order of percentage) includes lecture, case study, team project, simulations, and experiential learning. The Leadership Development Program begins at orientation when students join teams, and executive coaches work with students {{on an individual basis}} <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>their</b> leadership abilities.
