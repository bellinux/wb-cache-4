25|$|One of the {{identified}} {{causes of the}} waste {{in the health care}} system is a lack of communication between doctors and patients. The decisions of physicians account for most of a patient's expenses, yet physicians work under various pressures including limited <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with patients and review their information. Patients sometimes make requests for treatment against their doctor's advice in cases where more effective choices would be made if doctors had time to consult expert medical opinion.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 1964, {{one of the}} two {{registration}} {{days that}} month, John Lewis led 50 black citizens to the courthouse, but County Sheriff Jim Clark arrested them all rather than allowing them to apply to vote. On July 9, 1964 Judge James Hare issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under the sponsorship of civil rights organizations or leaders. This injunction made it illegal for more than two people at a <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about civil rights or voter registration in Selma, suppressing public civil rights activity there for the next six months.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

We're just people. #AllLivesMatter," [...] to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley, a blog affiliated with ESPN, in which he stated that De Fratus is [...] "complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn’t {{have the luxury of}} being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area." [...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters.

500|$|Many {{accounts}} concerning Eystein {{in later}} sagas {{are characterized by}} literary motifs, and have little value as sources on his life. Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic author of the early 13th century Heimskringla mastered this literary style particularly well, stylistically and psychologically. His stories includes a so-called mannjevning (literally [...] "comparison of men") between Eystein and Sigurd, {{in which the two}} boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other. In a similar fashion, Snorri also tells a story about how Eystein managed to cure the melancholy of a friend, by agreeing to regularly clear <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him about what troubled him. On his physical appearance, Snorri wrote that Eystein [...] "was the handsomest man that could be seen. He had blue open eyes; his hair yellow and curling; his stature not tall, but of the middle size." [...] More reliable information, particularly about Eystein's building-projects, is offered in earlier sagas such as the work of Theodoric the Monk, a Norwegian chronicler who wrote in the late 12th century.|$|E

This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him. Tom Wolfe characterised Shepard's dual personalities as [...] "Smilin' Al" [...] and the [...] "Icy Commander". [...] "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, [...] "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" ...|$|E

Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, [...] "They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire." [...] In addition, her small frame and 5'1" [...] stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, [...] "At {{the end of the program}} Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and told me what roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. Having those two women take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me made a big difference.
