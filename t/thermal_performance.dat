To determine the <b>thermal</b> <b>performance</b> of {{a heat sink}}, a theoretical model can be made. Alternatively, the <b>thermal</b> <b>performance</b> can be measured experimentally.

25|$|The case is {{the outer}} shell of the combustor, and is a fairly simple structure. The casing {{generally}} requires little maintenance. The case is protected from thermal loads by the air flowing in it, so <b>thermal</b> <b>performance</b> is of limited concern. However, the casing serves as a pressure vessel that must withstand {{the difference between the}} high pressures inside the combustor and the lower pressure outside. That mechanical (rather than thermal) load is a driving design factor in the case.|$|E

40|$|Layered {{discretization}} is {{an efficient}} way of realizing thermal cloaks. The {{aim of this}} paper is to investigate the effect of nonlinear coordinate transformation on the <b>thermal</b> cloaking <b>performance</b> of multilayered cylindrical thermal cloak. Two indexes are defined to quantify the <b>thermal</b> cloaking <b>performance.</b> Nonlinear coordinate transformations with different forms are established to design the multilayered structures and the <b>thermal</b> cloaking <b>performances</b> are analyzed by full-wave simulations. The results show that the <b>thermal</b> cloaking <b>performances</b> of multilayered structures are directly influenced by the form of coordinate transformation which determines the distributions of heat flows in the cloak region. Through the active changing of the form of coordinate transformation, the <b>thermal</b> cloaking <b>performance</b> of multilayered structure can be controlled and optimized. In addition, a three-piecewise linear coordinate transformation is designed to concentrate the heat flux into the middle region of the cloak and the corresponding multilayered structure is demonstrated to have near-perfect <b>thermal</b> cloaking <b>performance.</b> These results may provide a beneficial guidance to achieve performance improvements for multilayered structures of thermal cloaks...|$|R
25|$|Experimental {{tests are}} one of the more popular ways to {{determine}} the heat sink <b>thermal</b> <b>performance.</b> In order to determine the heat sink thermal resistance, the flow rate, input power, inlet air temperature and heat sink base temperature need to be known. Vendor-supplied data is commonly provided for ducted test results. However, the results are optimistic and can give misleading data when heat sinks are used in an unducted application. More details on heat sink testing methods and common oversights can be found in Azar, et al.|$|E
25|$|However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming {{at the bottom of the}} sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall <b>thermal</b> <b>performance,</b> manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.|$|E

40|$|Paper cups are {{ubiquitous}} {{in daily life}} for serving water, soup, coffee, tea, and milk due to their convenience, biodegradability, recyclability, and sustainability. The <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>performance</b> of paper cups is of significance because {{they are used to}} supply hot food or drinks. Using an effective thermal conductivity to accurately evaluate the <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>performance</b> of paper cups is complex due to the inclusion of complicated components and a multilayer structure. Moreover, an effective thermal conductivity is unsuitable for evaluating <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>performance</b> of paper cups in the case of fluctuating temperature. In this work, we propose a facile approach to precisely analyze the <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>performance</b> of paper cups in a particular range of temperature by using an evaluation model based on the MISO (Multiple-Input Single-Output) technical theory, which includes a characterization parameter (temperature factor) and a measurement apparatus. A series of experiments was conducted according to this evaluation model, and the results show that this evaluation model enables accurate characterization of the <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>performance</b> of paper cups and provides an efficient theoretical basis for selecting paper materials for paper cups...|$|R

Experimental results showed that, all of the temperature profiles of these four kinds of moistened fabrics under different radiant heat flux conditions presented the same variation trend. The addition of moisture had a positive influence on the <b>thermal</b> protective <b>performance</b> during the constant temperature period when heat radiation time was more than 60 seconds.

2500|$|Another {{configuration}} is the flared fin heat sink; its fins are not {{parallel to}} each other, {{as shown in}} figure 5. Flaring the fins decreases flow resistance and makes more air go through the heat sink fin channel; otherwise, more air would bypass the fins. Slanting them keeps the overall dimensions the same, but offers longer fins. Forghan, et al. have published data on tests conducted on pin fin, straight fin and flared fin heat sinks. They found that for low approach air velocity, typically around 1m/s, the <b>thermal</b> <b>performance</b> is at least 20% better than straight fin heat sinks. Lasance and Eggink also found that for the bypass configurations that they tested, the flared heat sink performed better than the other heat sinks tested.|$|E
2500|$|Reduction {{in energy}} use is an {{important}} property of green roofing. [...] By improving the <b>thermal</b> <b>performance</b> of a roof, green roofing allows buildings to better retain their heat during the cooler winter months while reflecting and absorbing solar radiation during the hotter summer months, allowing buildings to remain cooler. [...] A study conducted by Environment Canada found a 26% reduction in summer cooling needs and a 26% reduction in winter heat losses when a green roof is used. [...] With respect to hotter summer weather, green roofing is able to reduce the solar heating of a building by reflecting 27% of solar radiation, absorbing 60% by the vegetation through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and absorbing the remaining 13% into the growing medium. Such mitigation of solar radiation {{has been found to}} reduce building temperatures by up to 20Â°C and reduce energy needs for air-conditioning by 25% to 80%. [...] This reduction in energy required to cool a building in the summer is accompanied by a reduction in energy required to heat a building in the winter, thus reducing the energy requirements of the building year-round which allows the building temperature to be controlled at a lower cost.|$|E

When the chip was covered by GBF and G-CA, the temperature of hotspot could be reduced by 3. 1 Â°C, at heat flux of 580 W/cm 2. To analyze the <b>thermal</b> <b>performances</b> of G-CA and GBF in 3 D electronics packaging, the distribution of temperature and temperature profiles on the top surface of chip were analyzed by COMSOL. Both of GBF and G-CA could obviously reduce the temperature of hotspot on the top surface of chip, compared with that on the bare chip. With G-CA and GBF, the temperature of hotspot could be reduced by 8 Â°C. It suggests that both of G-CA and GBF are good heat spreading materials for electronics packaging application...|$|R
2500|$|The glass {{panels in}} {{double-glazed}} windows transmit heat {{in both directions}} by radiation, across the panes by convection, and by conduction around the perimeter seals. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better <b>thermal</b> <b>performance</b> than a typical wall.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek Ministry of Finance has now {{installed}} a green roof on the Treasury in Constitution Square in Athens. [...] The so-called [...] "oikostegi" [...] (Greek â€“ oiko, pronounced eeko, meaning building-ecological, and stegi, pronounced staygee, meaning roof-abode-shelter) was inaugurated in September, 2008. [...] Studies of the thermodynamics {{of the roof}} in September 2008 concluded that the <b>thermal</b> <b>performance</b> of the building was significantly affected by the installation. [...] In further studies, in August 2009, energy savings of 50% were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation. [...] The ten-floor building has a total floor space of 1.4 hectares. [...] The oikostegi covers 650m2, equalling 52% of the roof space and 8% of the total floor space. [...] Despite this, energy savings totalling â‚¬5,630 per annum were recorded, which translates to a 9% saving in air conditioning and a 4% saving in heating bills for the whole building. [...] An additional observation and conclusion {{of the study was}} that the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months {{between the first and second}} study. [...] This suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further. [...] The study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras, a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof, such as butterflies, honey bees and ladybirds. [...] Obviously this was not the case before installation. [...] Finally, the study suggested that both the micro-climate and biodiversity of Constitution Square, in Athens, Greece had been improved by the oikostegi.|$|E
