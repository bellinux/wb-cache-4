5|$|As in {{the colonial}} period, <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush {{continued}} to be tapped for its natural resources, with water becoming a target for development. The Patroon Creek, roughly where three feeder streams joined {{in the heart of}} <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake waterworks.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{regarded}} as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush {{has come to be}} seen as a historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York. It is home to the Karner blue butterfly, an endangered species first identified by author Vladimir Nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush {{is home to}} bog {{bluegrass}} (Poa paludigena), {{a federal}} species of concern, {{as well as the}} rare red-rooted flatsedge (Cyperus erythrorhizos), Houghton's umbrella-sedge (Cyperus houghtonii), and Schweinitz's flatsedge (Cyperus schweinitzii). Bog bluegrass occurs {{at the bottom of a}} ravine in <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush and is the only place in the New York Bight watershed where this plant appears. Bayard's malaxis (Malaxis bayardii) is a rare orchid that occurs in <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, {{a man is}} {{attacked}} while {{fixing a}} flat tire on the road near <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Barrens in New Jersey. His corpse is later found with his leg chewed off, and a hairy humanoid is killed nearby.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these developments, concerned citizens worried {{about the future of}} the habitat formed Save <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Bush in 1978. The organization filed lawsuits for the next several decades to stop further developments in the barrens.|$|E

50|$|Mid Dome was {{the source}} of an {{experiment}} during the late 1960s to confront the effects of ongoing land erosion. In an attempt to reduce erosion wilding <b>pines.</b> <b>The</b> solution was effective, with <b>the</b> <b>pines</b> spreading quickly over the western slopes of the mountain. In the early 1990s, however, it was noted that <b>the</b> <b>pines</b> were spreading beyond control and efforts have been made since that time to try to control them. Aerial spraying of <b>the</b> <b>pines</b> has been undertaken and has successfully reduced the area covered by <b>the</b> <b>pines.</b>|$|R
25|$|The project {{included}} {{the development of}} art designations for <b>The</b> <b>Pines</b> Gateways, such as banners and markers and mosaic pavers for <b>the</b> <b>Pines</b> Parks entrances and exits.|$|R

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1976, a {{restaurant}} in Fire Island Pines, New York, denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on July 4, 1976, sailed to <b>the</b> <b>Pines</b> by water taxi. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to <b>the</b> <b>Pines,</b> called <b>the</b> Invasion of <b>the</b> <b>Pines.</b>|$|R

More than 20species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern black racer (Coluber constrictor priapus).

5|$|A short {{distance}} later, the two routes enter Manchester Township in Ocean County and continue east through a tract of the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest within <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Barrens {{as well as}} a corner of the Fort Dix Military Reservation. The road eventually reaches the community of Whiting, where it passes commercial development at the intersection with CR 539. Here, CR 530 turns south to follow CR 539 and Route 70 continues northeast back into <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Barrens. The road turns more to the north-northeast before heading east into Lakehurst to the south of the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. In Lakehurst, Route 70 comes to a traffic circle with CR 4 and CR 12 before running through residential and commercial areas of the town. It intersects with the southern terminus of CR 547, where it widens into a four-lane divided highway. From here, the route crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line before coming to the Lakehurst Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 37.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. They lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. The Iroquois and other tribes used <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there, though they did use the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it.|$|E

5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), <b>the</b> <b>pine</b> and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, shrubs and bushes, such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|August 20, 1939– Tuckerton {{receives}} 14.8inches (376mm) of precipitation, {{which is}} the wettest known tropical cyclone in the state. The storm also causes major flooding in <b>the</b> <b>Pine</b> Barrens, washing away a historic village and derailing a train in Chatsworth.|$|E
5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and moving it to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to <b>the</b> <b>pine</b> ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital.
