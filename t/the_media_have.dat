5|$|Malaysia's main {{newspapers}} {{are owned by}} the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the two halves of the country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> {{been criticized}} for {{focusing}} more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that {{she would like to}} focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated that Obama is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E

25|$|Tensions along caste {{lines between}} the Kunbi and the Dalit {{communities}} {{were seen in}} the Khairlanji killings, and <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> reported sporadic instances of violence against Dalits.

25|$|In {{his book}} The Myth of Male Power, author Warren Farrell {{suggested}} that Laurie Dann's actions were {{an example of}} women's violence against men. He claimed, erroneously, that all of Dann's victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist. Men's rights activists, academics, and <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion. Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} question of the elections was which party would become the largest, the governing Christian-democratic CDA or the main opposition party, the social-democratic PvdA. This {{was similar to the}} situation of the elections of 2003. The largest party will have the initiative in the cabinet formation talks. Furthermore, if it becomes part of the cabinet, the largest party supplies the prime minister. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> framed the elections as a 'Clash of the Titans' between prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende (CDA) and candidate prime minister Wouter Bos (PvdA).|$|E

One train driver interviewed in 2009 reported that he had worked as a driver for Vietnam Railways for over 10 years without receiving any training or professional development to improve his skills, which he had learned in Russia. Checks on drivers have also been suggested, along with random blood testing to detect whether drivers have used alcohol.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> exerted {{substantial}} {{influence over}} the timing and course of HIV control in China by bringing news of HIV {{to the attention of}} the public, administrators, and policymakers. In 1996, the Southern Weekend newspaper ran a front-page story and devoted another two pages to AIDS in China. This coverage was the first time any comprehensive exposure of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China had been published by the Chinese press. From 1999, the international and subsequently the national media reported on the thousands of infected plasma donors in Henan and neighbouring provinces who did not have access to services. Although the government had acted quickly when the tragedy became apparent in 1995 by shutting down collection stations and, later, introducing new laws and regulations on the collection and management of blood and blood products, provision of HIV testing, prevention, and care for donors in the local areas was slower. Progress was stimulated by the media's attention to the plight of the infected plasma donors. Since these initial reports, the HIV/AIDS situation in China has received much attention from the local and international media.|$|E

The Homeland Security Advisory System and rendition are also referenced. One of the forbidden items in Gordon's secret basement is a protest poster with a mixed US–UK flag with a swastika and the title [...] "Coalition of the Willing, To Power" [...] which combines the [...] "Coalition of the Willing" [...] with Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of will to power.|$|E
