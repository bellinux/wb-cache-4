5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.

5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is to deceive <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye.</b> Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye</b> uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E

They discover that the boy and a couple of friends have been playing with the ability to accelerate their movements to a frequency <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye</b> can’t perceive.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye,</b> so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
40|$|Flicker {{is a kind}} of {{annoyance}} of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eyes.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eyes</b> are sensitive to the light color and light intensity, which vary under flicker conditions. The light color depends on the light spectrum. How the light spectrum varies under flicker is the interesting problem. In this paper, the lamp light spectrum of the incandescent lamp and the fluorescent lamp is presented.

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye,</b> such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye</b> as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye,</b> but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E

50|$|The Leica SL (Typ 601) {{introduced}} the first EyeRes® Viewfinder which {{is described by}} Leica as a combination of optical and electronic components. The resolution, angle of view and the refresh rate of the viewfinder should exceed <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye's</b> ability.|$|R
50|$|Infrared Data Association (IrDA) uses {{infrared}} light, {{which has}} a frequency below <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye's</b> sensitivity. Infrared in general is used, for instance, in TV remotes. Typical WPAN devices that use IrDA include printers, keyboards, and other serial data interfaces.|$|R
5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye</b> would actually perceive.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye.</b> For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with the brightness of the light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination {{to be taken into account}} in the rendering. Refraction effects were added to make light account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E
5|$|Underwater {{vision is}} {{affected}} by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. <b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye</b> is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.|$|E
30|$|To {{achieve the}} {{invisible}} AR tag, we utilized the temporal psycho-visual modulation (TPVM) technique [10]. TPVM can be adopted in various refresh rates, such as 60, 120, and 240  Hz, via digital monitors or projectors. Especially, for the popular 3 D media, the monitor/television {{is able to}} support up to 120 -Hz refresh rate. However, in most cases, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eyes</b> are incapable of perceiving the optical signal that flashes frequency beyond 60  Hz [11]. Based on the observation, we aim to design an invisible AR tag approach with TPVM such that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eyes</b> can only observe the original media without the AR tag on the digital monitor or projector [12].|$|R

50|$|Similar to {{the eyes}} of other mammals, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>eye's</b> non-image-forming {{photosensitive}} ganglion cells in the retina receive light signals which affect adjustment {{of the size of}} the pupil, regulation and suppression of the hormone melatonin and entrainment of the body clock.|$|R
