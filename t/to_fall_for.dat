5|$|Despite loving Nikki, Victor begins <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> Ashley Abbott (Brenda Epperson) {{and they}} have an affair, enraging Nikki to sleep with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Ashley’s brother and Victor’s {{business}} rival. Ashley becomes pregnant and Victor leaves Nikki, but when Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, Victor returns to her and Ashley aborts the child. When Nikki goes into remission, Victor {{wanted to be with}} Ashley, who had moved on with her psychiatrist Steven Lassiter (Rod Arrants); Steven later dies, and while Ashley wanted Victor back, he had returned to Nikki in an attempted to salvage their marriage, resulting in the birth of their son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Victor and Jack later hire Leanna Love (Barbara Crampton) to write a biography on Victor, when in reality, Jack wanted the book to be a tell-all expose on Victor. Leanna later writes a chapter about Victor’s affair with Ashley and Nikki’s illness, causing Victor to believe Nikki was behind the publication. He divorces her and marries Leanna to prove to the press that he didn’t want to be with Ashley; their marriage was invalid, as the divorce wasn’t finalized. Victor later takes over Jack’s family company, Jabot Cosmetics, replacing him with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). As a result, Jack spitefully marries Nikki, causing her relationship with Victor to become bitter. Victor marries Ashley, and years later; he tells Jack that he will give him back Jabot Cosmetics if he divorces Nikki. He agrees to do so, but Jack wasn’t given full control of the company due to a legal loophole. Victor has a heart attack during a confrontation with Jack, and while he leaves him for dead, Victor recovers. As Jack and Nikki’s marriage strained to due her alcoholism and pain killer addiction, she reconnected with Victor, who had decided to divorce Ashley.|$|E
5|$|Halfway {{through the}} day, England fell to 5/119, and captain Yardley came in. He hit Toshack in the air, but Barnes {{was unable to}} {{complete}} the reflex catch at short leg. However, this error did not cost many runs. Yardley lofted Toshack into the on-side and the hands of Johnson at forward square leg <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> 22 with the score at 6/141. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6. Toshack bowled Dick Pollard late in the innings to finish with 2/75 from 41 overs—including 20 maidens—as England ended with 363. Toshack was unbeaten on zero and was only at the crease for one minute as Australia replied with 221. In the second innings, Toshack removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, and ended with 1/26 as the rain-affected match ended in a draw. He also had Washbrook dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson, one of several times that the batsman was reprieved during the innings.|$|E

They separate, and Karl begins a relationship with Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte). Susan begins dating again and she falls for Lyn's brother-in-law, Tom Scully, a Catholic Priest. Lyn and Libby are unhappy about the relationship and it eventually ends. Karl and Susan divorce, but they remain friends. Susan begins a relationship with Alex Kinski (Andrew Clarke) after he enrolls his children Rachel (Caitlin Stasey) and Zeke (Matthew Werkmeister) at Erinsborough High. Alex is diagnosed with Lymphoma and he asks Susan to marry him; she accepts. Alex's condition deteriorates and they decide to marry right away. The marriage is witnessed by Karl, Rachel, Zeke, and Alex's older daughter, Katya (Dichen Lachman). Alex passes away shortly after. Susan begins <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> Karl again and she declares her love for him. They get back together in secret, but Rachel and Zeke find out the truth and believe that Susan did not love their father. They later give Karl and Susan their blessings. While Susan and Karl are on holiday in London, Karl proposes for a third time. Susan immediately accepts and they remarry on a boat on the Thames. The ceremony is interrupted when Izzy goes into labour and Karl delivers her daughter, Holly (Chaya Broadmore).

25|$|While Liverpool {{through most}} of the 19th and early 20th Century was a {{municipal}} stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her 1979 general election victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> many years. Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes {{along with the rest of}} the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied.|$|E
25|$|India was on {{the charge}} from the {{beginning}} of their innings when debutante Yusuf Pathan started aggressively by hitting one four and one six. But he was the first <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> 15 runs at 25/1 at over 2.4. Then Indian scoring rate was going down. Robin Uthappa(8 run from 11 ball), Yuvraj Singh(14 run from 19 ball), MS Dhoni(6 run from 10 ball) all departed soon and while Gambhir was stuck to the other end. His 75 from 56 hit 8 four and 2 six and Rohit Sharma's 30 not out of 16 hit 2 four and one six at last stage took India to 157–5 in 20 overs. Umar Gul took 3–28 to be the best performer for Pakistan.Mohammad Asif and Sohail Tanvir take one wicket each.|$|E

25|$|The {{second day}} saw India make a heavy string of {{mistakes}} which cost them dearly. Coming in at 329/4, with Ganguly and Laxman both looking good for better scores, India began the day's play {{with much more}} confidence than their opponents. India did begin brightly, after Ganguly unfurled some glorious strokes against Nathan Bracken and Lee. However, in the 95th over bowled by Lee, which lasted 8 balls, courtesy of three no-balls from the bowler, Ganguly's weakness against fast-bowlers resurfaced as he popped a short-of-length ball to gully after knocking Lee for two fours, becoming the fifth wicket <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>for</b> 350. Thereafter, India completely lost their way. Poor judgment from the lower-order batsmen and Laxman's dismissal for 19 contributed to India's spectacular demise, as the last 6 wickets fell for 16 runs.|$|E
25|$|The Indians stated {{their first}} innings well, with Mankad and Sarwate putting on 124 {{for the first}} wicket, before the latter became the first wicket <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> 36 scored from 84 balls, {{dismissed}} by Bill Johnston. Then the next wicket fell at 145, this time it being that of Gul Mohammad, who was caught and bowled by Bruce Dooland, for 12. Mankad and Hazare contributed a stand of 43 before Hazare was dismissed by Sid Barnes. The next ball afterward, the Indian Captain, Amarnath fell for a duck getting out lbw to Barnes, who got his second wicket. The fifth wicket to fall, at 198, was that of Mankad himself, who had contributed a 116, which created history because it was India's first test century against Australia. He was caught by Don Tallon, the wicketkeeper, off Bill Johnston's bowling for a fine 116. Then Adhikari and Phadkar put up a partnership of 62 to bring some respectability to the score before Adhikari was dismissed for 24. Overnight rain made batting difficult, and after three cheap wickets, Amarnath declared even though India were 103 runs behind. To counter the difficult conditions, Bradman sent his tailenders, Dooland, Johnson and Johnston. But when Sid Barnes fell with the score on 32, Wisden noted that Bradman might have felt worried.|$|E
25|$|Continuing with relationships, Ivy {{is still}} with Dixon but returns from Australia with her old {{childhood}} friend, Oscar, who seems to make Dixon uncomfortable. Oscar has hidden motives for revenge on Laurel, Ivy's mother, who he believes is responsible for his mother's suicide. He and Laurel have been sleeping together secretly throughout the summer, and the next step of his plan is to sleep with Ivy as well. When he succeeds, taking her virginity, both of them find out, leaving Ivy upset with her mother. Dixon breaks up with Ivy out of fear after finding out from his ex-girlfriend Sasha {{that he may be}} HIV positive, though he later tests negative (Oscar had bribed Sasha to tell Dixon this in order to make him leave Ivy so that he could make a move). Dixon and Ivy get back together, but Dixon then finds out that Oscar took Ivy's virginity on the night she and Dixon had argued and the two break up again. Naomi starts <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> Oscar, even though Ivy has warned her of his actions. When he offers to be her boyfriend, she declines. However, unluckily for Naomi, Mr. Cannon is waiting for her in her hotel room when she returns from Adrianna's Christmas party. Mr. Cannon holds Naomi hostage and invites Silver to come over. Once she arrives, Mr. Cannon ties her up as well and tells the girls of his plan to prove his innocence and go to the bank to drain Naomi's trust fund. Silver and Naomi gang up and attack Mr. Cannon. Naomi wants to slit his throat but Silver talks her out of it and calls the police.|$|E

25|$|Laxman came to {{the crease}} just {{before the end of}} Day 3 and {{proceeded}} to change the course of both the match and the series by hitting 281, at that time the record for an Indian Test batsman. He did most of his damage partnered with Dravid, who hit 180; the two were at the crease for the entire fourth day. India progressed to 657/7 in their second innings (a lead of 383), declared shortly before lunch on the final day (giving Australia insufficient time to reach the total, thus securing at least a draw). By tea, Australia had scored 161/3, and a draw appeared the most likely result. Then, within minutes, Australia lost five wickets for 8 runs in a span of 31 balls. Harbhajan took the first two wickets in the same over, followed quickly by three wickets from Sachin Tendulkar. Australia proceeded <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> 212 in the second innings and India won the match. Despite Harbhajan's prodigious bowling—6 for 73 to go with his seven-wicket haul from the first innings—Laxman was named man of the match. India's 171-run victory was by far the largest of the three Test victories by the team following on (both of England's winning margins had been fewer than 20 runs), and it was only time in history that a side has been able to declare the follow-on innings and still win. India under the captaincy of Saurav Ganguly {{went on to win the}} 3rd test, and hence the series, with Laxman contributing half-centuries in both innings and Harbhajan, who was named as man of the series for taking 32 wickets.|$|E
25|$|That was not all, however. The chase began very sedately, only Tushar Imran {{looking to}} take runs as he smashed Brad Hogg about, but Hogg got his revenge when Tushar was out for 24, lofting to Katich. Earlier, Nafees Iqbal had gone for 8, and with Javed Omar {{out as the}} third man <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>for</b> 19 off 51 balls, it looked to be {{business}} as usual for Bangladesh. But this match had more tricks up its sleeve. Hogg and Clarke leaked runs like a drain, six wides were bowled, and Mohammad Ashraful showed another glimpse of why he's been called Bangladesh's finest batsman. As he made the second ODI hundred in the Bangladesh team's history, he forged a massive 130-run partnership with Habibul Bashar, and had a great two hours at the crease (although dropped on 54) – before picking out Jason Gillespie at long on to be out for exactly 100. Bangladesh still needed 23 runs off 17 balls, but Aftab Ahmed continued his fine form from the Oval match with England, as he first took a leg bye off Ashraful, then gave the strike to Rafique, who smashed a cover driven four before taking another leg bye. A four and a dot-ball finished a 10-run over, meaning that Bangladesh now needed only 13 off 12 balls. A good over from McGrath followed, as he conceded only six runs – including an edged four from Rafique. With the last over, Bangladesh needed seven runs, and Ahmed swung the first ball of the over to midwicket for six. Thus, it became a formality – Bangladesh won with four balls and five wickets to spare, almost convincing in today's cricket, and the result meant that the Aussies needed a victory over England at Bristol the following day to have any chance of winning the group stage.|$|E
