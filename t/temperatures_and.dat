30|$|The {{goals of}} this study were to {{determine}} the effects of furnish type and mat density on <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> vapor pressure inside the mat of wood-based panels during hot pressing and to confirm their effects on panel properties. Two furnish types, hinoki strand (HS) and recycled wood particles (RW), were used for experimental panels using urea–formaldehyde resin at five board densities and 15  % mat moisture content. A monitoring device was used to sense the <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> vapor pressure during hot pressing. The results from this study showed that furnish type and mat density affected <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> vapor pressure behaviors. The results also showed the effect on panel properties. HS-board had a higher plateau temperature, longer plateau time, and higher vapor pressure than did Mixed- and RW-board. Higher mat density was associated with higher plateau <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> vapor pressure and longer plateau time and vapor pressure band. Plateau time <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> were also correlated with vapor pressure. Furthermore, density showed linear relationships with plateau <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> internal bonding (IB). A linear relationship was also found between plateau <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> IB, and non-linear relationships were found for vapor pressure with plateau <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> IB.|$|R
