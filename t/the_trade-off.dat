5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. <b>The</b> <b>trade-off</b> {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E

25|$|The {{slope of}} the curve at a point on it gives <b>the</b> <b>trade-off</b> between the two goods.

Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. Along the PPF, scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good. Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.|$|E
25|$|At {{the heart}} of yield {{management}} decision-making process is <b>the</b> <b>trade-off</b> of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers {{in the hopes that}} the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for inventory control decisions. In these cases the intersection of the marginal revenue curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the point of interest.|$|E

Once in control, these warlords can expropriate the property or resources from the people and land and redistribute the riches in exchange for monetary value. When people live in a particular region dominated by a warlord, they can choose to flee or live within the political structure the warlords have created. If the warlords provide protection against external threats of violence, the people will be likely to stay and continue living and working in that region, even though they are being extorted. <b>The</b> <b>trade-off</b> becomes protection for extraction, and this political framework is common in periphery regions of countries which do not have a strong central government.|$|E

25|$|The DRS {{undertook}} {{terrestrial broadcasting}} for large cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages. However, {{it did not}} provide for small towns where the TV set density was {{higher than in the}} villages while not as much as in a city. The concept of a low-power limited rebroadcast (LRB) TV transmitter system was evolved to overcome such situations. The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a 4.5m chicken-mesh parabolic antenna with a low-noise block converter, that served as the front-end for a low-power TV transmitter at the same location. Two suitable locations, Sambalpur in Orissa (75 villages) and Muzaffarpur in Bihar (110 villages), were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems. This experiment was expected to provide useful data on <b>the</b> <b>trade-off</b> between DRS and LRB.
