5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
500|$|During the {{rehearsal}} for that evening, Julie and Steve {{learn that the}} town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut {{on the back of}} her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.|$|E
500|$|While out fishing, Homer is {{abducted}} {{by the two}} aliens, Kang and Kodos. When they demand that Homer point them towards Earth's leader, Homer informs them of the upcoming presidential election and says the winner could be either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole. Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton, placing them in suspended animation tubes and assuming their forms through [...] "bio-duplication" [...] to ensure {{that one of them}} will become the next leader. Before returning Homer to Earth, the aliens soak him in rum, so nobody will believe him. As the election nears, the impostor candidates are seen to be acting strangely, holding hands in public and making bizarre declarations in unhumanlike monotone. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save Dole and Clinton, with both candidates agreeing they should join forces to defeat the aliens; however, Homer accidentally ejects them into space. On the day before the election, Homer crashes the spaceship into the Capitol and reveals the candidates' real identities. However, despite being exposed, Kang and Kodos declare to the people that <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose one of them because it is too late to get new candidates. Kang is subsequently elected president and enslaves all of humanity.|$|E

500|$|The {{two teams}} {{did not play}} in the same division. However, each AFL team played all other {{teams in the league}} each year, {{allowing}} the Raiders and Jets to forge a bitter rivalry. In 1963, Oakland general manager (later owner) Al Davis traded guard Dan Ficca to New York during training camp, without mentioning to Ewbank (who was also the Jets' general manager) that Ficca would not be released from his military service for another six weeks. In 1966, with less than a minute to go and the Raiders leading at the new Oakland Coliseum, 28–20, Jets left tackle Winston Hill predicted to Namath in the huddle that the man he was blocking, Ben Davidson, would rush on the next play, leaving the Raiders exposed to a draw play. Namath called the draw, and handed the ball off to running back Emerson Boozer for 47 yards and a touchdown. After a Jets two-point conversion, the game ended in a 28–28 tie, and an embittered Davidson stated, [...] "I'll get even. <b>They</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play us next year." [...] They did, twice. In Week 4, the Jets defeated the Raiders at Shea Stadium, 27–14; this was the Raiders' only regular season loss. In Week 14, each team's 13th game, the teams met again, in Oakland. Sportswriter Paul Zimmerman said of the second 1967 Jets-Raiders game: ...|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler {{also spoke}} in {{opposition}} to the extension of the football schedule from 10 to 11 games for the 1971 season: [...] "I think the NCAA made a mistake in going to 11 games[...] [...] [...] I love the game and I love to coach it but I also realize that in college <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go [...] to school[...] [...] [...] [...] it does take away somewhat from their academic pursuits. I was concerned about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon list several {{disadvantages}} {{of the union}} organizing model, with the most critical being that the model is very [...] "resource-intensive," [...] {{in terms of both}} people and money. Since the organizing model is, at its core, about people, rather than services, it cannot be effective without people to both implement it and carry it out. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon talk about [...] "...instances of a lack of support or even opposition to organizing within unions." [...] Because the organizing model is so dependent upon worker motivation and action, if the workers themselves oppose the implementation of the organizing model, it cannot be effective. Fletcher and Hurd suggest that even if members are not resistant to adoption of the organizing model, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn how to perform tasks previously handled by organizers, and there have to be enough active members to facilitate this kind of action. This clear dependence on the support and actions of the workers is a disadvantage of the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, which, for the most part, does not require worker support or demand worker action. According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, [...] "Employers are often resistant." [...] Unions that have to deal with this problem would very clearly have a hard time using the organizing model, as it could antagonize the employer even further and erode any previously existing relationship between the employer and the union.|$|E

6000|$|... "When the dikes {{enclosing}} {{the lake}} were completed, the engineers set up three very powerful steam engines, and gave {{to each one}} ten or twelve enormous pumps to work. These pumping engines were made on such a grand scale that they lifted over sixty tuns of water at every stroke. But yet so large was the lake, and so vast the quantity of water to be drained, that though {{there were three of}} the engines working at this rate, and though they were kept at work night and day, it took them {{a year and a half}} to lay the ground dry. The work was, however, at last accomplished, and now, what was the bottom of the lake is all converted into pastures and green fields. But <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep the pumps going all the time to lift out the surplus water that falls over the whole space in rain. You may judge that the amount is very large that falls on a district thirty miles round. They calculate that the quantity which they have to pump up now, every year, in order to keep the land from being overflowed again, is over fifty millions of tuns. And that is a quantity larger than you can ever conceive of.|$|E
