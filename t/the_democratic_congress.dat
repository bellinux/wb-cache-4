5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year– {{in part because of}} the unpopularity of <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress</b> as a whole, and in part because this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E

Neither Republicans nor Democrats would support the steel companies if the strike triggered an election-year recession, and Nixon urged management to accept {{the terms of the}} Kaiser Steel settlement. Industry executives agreed to a new contract, similar to the Kaiser Steel settlement, in the last week of December.|$|E
500|$|Although Kemp coaxed Bush {{to support}} a $4billion housing program that {{encouraged}} public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress</b> allocated only $361million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as {{did most of the}} Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force. [...] However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.|$|E

500|$|The public {{sympathized with}} McKinley for his {{financial}} trouble, {{and he was}} easily re-elected as governor in late 1893. At that time, the United States, for all practical purposes, was on the gold standard. Many Democrats, and some Republicans, felt that the gold standard limited economic growth, and supported bimetallism, making silver legal tender, {{as it had been}} until the passage of the Coinage Act of 1873. Doing so would likely be inflationary, permitting holders of silver to deposit bullion at the mints, and receive payment for about twice the silver's 1896 market value. Many farmers, faced with the long decline in agricultural prices that persisted through {{the first half of the}} 1890s, felt that bimetallism would expand the money supply and make it easier to pay their debts. Cleveland was a firm supporter of the gold standard, and believed the massive amounts of silver-backed currency issued pursuant to the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 had helped crash the economy. In 1893 he forced through the act's repeal, outraging western Democrats such as Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan. <b>The</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1894 passed the Wilson–Gorman Tariff, significantly lowering many rates from the McKinley Tariff of 1890. The economy did not improve in 1894, and other Cleveland actions, such as federal intervention to halt the Pullman strike, further split his party, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{outcome of}} the Leach-Wilson race {{remained}} uncertain for weeks, but the official state returns, as ultimately accepted by <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress,</b> declared Leach the winner by 266 votes: 65,583 (50.1 percent) to 65,317 (49.9 percent). Wilson secured majorities only in Caddo and Bossier parishes, where he drew 55.1 percent and 54.4 percent, respectively. Wilson polled [...] 47.4 percent in Webster Parish, 45.1 percent in Claiborne Parish, and 44.1 percent in Sabine Parish. In three other parishes, Wilson trailed far behind, 38.9 percent in Red River Parish (Coushatta), 37.5 percent in De Soto Parish (Mansfield), and 32.7 percent in Leach's Vernon Parish.|$|E
2500|$|Boehner {{has been}} highly {{critical}} of several initiatives by <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress</b> and President Barack Obama, including the [...] "cap and trade" [...] plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and said that, if Republicans {{took control of the}} House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would {{do whatever it takes to}} stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying [...] "one dime" [...] to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan. He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI). [...] He has advocated for an across-the-board spending freeze, including entitlement programs.|$|E
