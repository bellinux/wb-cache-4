The {{next day the}} board sent senate subpoenas directly to the USAF headquarters office at the Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning that the senate was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.|$|E
5|$|As selected, the Nimrod MRA4 {{was to be}} {{produced}} as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes {{were involved in the}} remanufacturing process, including the installation of current-generation BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger and more efficient wing, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is significantly greater than that of the original Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the glass cockpit used was derived from the Airbus A340 airliner. British Aerospace also teamed up with Boeing <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> Nimrod MRA4's mission systems, making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737.|$|E
5|$|Further reviews came in {{this time}} as Defence {{planners}} attempted {{to grapple with the}} questions regarding strategy following the wars of diplomacy of the previous three decades. The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine as the foundation upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb's 1986 review of Australia's defence capabilities seemed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> Reserves with a definite role. Nevertheless, there remained a reluctance to rebuild the Reserves and despite these major reviews, as late as the 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well-structured reserve force, as it had continued to grapple with the competing demands of maintaining large-scale general readiness over developing a 'hard core' of capability within the Reserves that would be able <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency.|$|E

5|$|The Hawkins-class cruiser was {{designed}} to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas. This required a large ship <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders.

Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, included both coal and oil-fired boilers <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions. Four ships were ordered, named after famous Elizabethan seafarers, in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916, named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish. By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended, so construction proceeded slowly.|$|E
