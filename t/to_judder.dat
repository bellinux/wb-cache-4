40|$|Display systems {{typically}} {{operate at}} a minimum rate of 60 Hz. However, existing VR-architectures generally produce application updates at a lower rate. Consequently, the display is not updated by the application every display frame. This causes a number of undesirable perceptual artifacts. We describe an architecture that provides a programmable display layer (PDL) in order to generate updated display frames. This replaces the default display behavior of repeating application frames until an update is available. We will show three benefits of the architecture typical to VR. First, smooth motion is provided by generating intermediate display frames by per-pixel depth-image warping using 3 D motion fields. Smooth motion eliminates various perceptual artifacts due <b>to</b> <b>judder.</b> Second, we implement fine-grained latency reduction at the display frame level using a synchronized prediction of simulation objects and the viewpoint. This improves the average quality and consistency of latency reduction. Third, a crosstalk reduction algorithm for consecutive display frames is implemented, which improves the quality of stereoscopic images. To evaluate the architecture, we compare image quality and latency {{to that of a}} classic level-of-detail approach...|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper presents an investigation of the driveline torsional vibration behaviour, referred to as judder, which takes place during the clutch engagement process, particularly on small trucks with diesel engines. A non-linear multibody dynamic model of the clutch mechanism is employed to study the effect of various clutch system and driveline components on the clutch actuation performance. The paper demonstrates that judder is affected by driveline inertial changes, variation in the coefficient of friction, μ, of the friction disc linings with slip speed, v, and the loss of clamp load. The results of the simulations show that various friction materials with different μ–v characteristics produce torsional self-excited vibrations of the driveline. The results also show that loss of clamp load relating to the speed of clutch actuation also contributes <b>to</b> <b>judder.</b> Furthermore, it is shown that the simulation results conform closely to the experimental findings...|$|E
40|$|Judder {{may fall}} under the {{headings}} of cold or hot judder but {{by far the most}} complex to understand is hot judder. This may result from rotor deformation or an effect referred to as "hot spotting". It is clear that to minimise the occurrence of thermal judder it is necessary to avoid excessive heating of the rotor {{and at the same time}} avoid significant variation in temperature across the rotor. To this end the designer must ensure uniform heat dissipation from the rotor. In high performance braking applications vented discs are normally used as these provide a greater cooling surface. These discs increase cooling efficiency by employing braking surfaces (blades) separated by a number of "ribs" or "vanes" which allow air to pass between the two blades. To increase cooling efficiency some vented discs use pins to separate the braking surfaces as this arrangement increases the available area to dissipate the heat. The cooling efficiency of the brake discs depends on two parameters; the mass flow rate of air through the disc and the effective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the disc blades and vent vanes/pins. "Pin" type vented discs have been found to be good at increasing heat transfer coefficient but mass flow rates through such discs are generally smaller when compared to vane type discs. This paper attempts to define a plausible way of controlling the shape of the columns within a pin vented disc with a view to finding an optimised configuration for a disc consisting of three rows of 36 "pins" positioned so that their centre lines are separated by ten degrees, with the central row of pins offset by five degrees to the outer and inner rows. The optimisation of this "pin" arrangement attempts to increase the average heat transfer coefficient and the wetted area in order to enhance the aero-thermal characteristics of the disc to increase heat dissipation from the rotor in a uniform manner and hence decrease the discs tendency <b>to</b> <b>judder.</b> The results presented within clearly show the advantages of increasing the pumping efficiency of the brake rotor; this is demonstrated by the "high mass flow rate" design. It has also been shown that increasing the width of the second an third rows of pins produces a decrease in the flow rate through the disc whereas the first row has an optimal width that creates a venturi at the inlet which aids inlet velocities. A reasonable correlation has been demonstrated between the results from the computational fluid dynamic analysis and those gained from empirical formulas as well as previous computational studies...|$|E

After an hour of resistance, with Naiad belatedly approaching, Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces. Santa Brigida had lost two men killed and eight wounded, Alcmene one killed and nine wounded and Triton a single man wounded.|$|R

If this vibration is exposed to the driver {{for a long period}} it can lead to tiredness during driving. There are two types of judder which is cold judder and hot judder. This paper will be focusing on the hot judder. As a disc surface heats up during braking it causes both sides of the disc distort and hence produce a sinusoidal waviness around its edges.

This phenomenon is induced by stick-slip oscillations at the friction lining interfaces between the clutch disc and flywheel, and the pressure plate. The phenomenon {{is influenced by the}} clutch lining friction characteristics, the topography of the mating-sliding surfaces, and the operational conditions during the engagement process. Therefore, the interfacial characteristics are affected by contact pressure, interfacial slip speed, and surface temperature.

40|$|High speed {{testing of}} a brake system using two {{different}} callipers and two different discs {{on a special}} test rig with a swinging calliper head mounting shows similar results with regard <b>to</b> hot <b>judder.</b> Holographic interferometry is used {{in an attempt to}} observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary information was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a permanent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode formation. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder – the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the calliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the calliper body. The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A “strobing” effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes “just off” the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc centre. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing end of the pads with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface. Other observations include hot spotting on the disc surface and a surface scan of the disc face indicates a depression at these positions. A metallurgical analysis of the blue spot is currently being carried out to determine if a material phase change has occurred within the disc body and this will be included in the paper.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Clutch take-up judder is a {{torsional}} vibration phenomenon induced by stick-slip oscillations at the friction lining interfaces between the clutch friction disc and the flywheel and pressure plate surfaces {{during the process}} of clutch engagement. This is short-lived transient phenomenon affected by the clutch lining material’s friction characteristics, topography of the mating-sliding surfaces and operational conditions during engagement such as contact pressure, interfacial slip speed and contact temperature.

40|$|Developed by O＇Beirne and Trounson (Trounson, 2012), the UC Auditory-Visual Matrix Sentence Test (UCAMST) is an auditory-visual {{speech test}} in NZ English where {{sentences}} are assembled from 50 words arranged into 5 columns (name, verb, quantity, adjective, object). Generation of sentence materials involved cutting and re-assembling 100 naturally spoken ‟original” sentences {{to create a}} large repertoire of 100, 000 unique ‟synthesised” sentences. The process of synthesising sentences from video fragments resulted in occasional artifactual image jerks (‟judders”) ‒quantified by an unusually large change in the ‟pixel difference value” of consecutive frames‒at the edited transitions between video fragments. To preserve the naturalness of materials, Study 1 aimed to select transitions with the least ‟noticeable” judders. Normal-hearing participants (n = 18) assigned a 10 -point noticeability rating score to 100 sentences comprising unedited ‟no judder” sentences (n = 28), and ‟synthesised” sentences (n = 72) that varied in the severity (i. e. pixel difference value), number, and position of judders. The <b>judders</b> were found <b>to</b> be significantly noticeable compared <b>to</b> no <b>judder</b> controls, and based on mean rating score, 2, 494 sentences with ‟minimal noticeable judder” {{were included in the}} auditory-visual UCAMST. Follow-on work should establish equivalent lists using these sentences. The average pixel difference value was found to be a significant predictor of rating score, therefore may be used as a guide in future development of auditory-visual speech tests assembled from video fragments. The aim of Study 2 was to normalise the auditory-alone UCAMST to make each audio fragment equally intelligible in noise. In Part I, individuals with normal hearing (n = 17) assessed 400 sentences containing each file fragment presented at four different SNRs (- 18. 5, - 15, - 11. 5, and - 8 dB) in both constant speech-shaped noise (n = 9) and six-talker babble (n = 8). An intelligibility function was fitted to word-specific data, and the midpoint (Lmid, intelligibility at 50 %) of each function was adjusted to equal the mean pre-normalisation midpoint across fragments. In Part II, 30 lists of 20 sentences were generated with relatively homogeneous frequency of matrix word use. The predicted parameters in constant noise (Lmid = 14. 0 dB SNR; slope = 13. 9 %/dB ± 0. 0 %/dB) are comparable with published equivalents. The babble noise condition was, conversely, less sensitive (Lmid = 14. 9 dB SNR; slope = 10. 3 %/dB ± 0. 1 %/dB), possibly due to a smaller sample size (n = 8). Overall, this research constituted an important first step in establishing the UCAMST as a reliable measure of speech recognition; follow-on work will validate the normalisation procedure carried out in this project...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{retarding}} a moving vehicle or object {{in a controlled}} manner has been investigated over hundreds of years with many different solutions being developed over the years. As time has progressed a common overall design has almost uniformly been agreed upon for vehicle use; a brake disc and caliper or brake drum arrangement. As vehicle refinement has improved there has been increasing focus on the refinement of such designs with regards to their noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) characteristics. Whilst brake noise has had significant research analysing its cause, effect and solutions, brake judder has had less research focussed upon it. The principal reason for past research priorities and the recent interest in judder is because of the increased demands being placed on brakes – higher power absorption with lighter structures. The subject of this thesis was to address the least known phenomena of brake judder, that of the thermo-elastic deformation of vented brake discs. The research utilised experimental, analytical and empirical methods to give a broader understanding of the transient deformation process, both thermo-plastic and thermo-elastic, of a high performance vehicle disc brake. Initial characterisation of thermal judder was carried out on-vehicle where it was identified that brake pressure {{could be used as a}} reliable indicator to show the developing nature of this phenomenon. The brake pressure pulsation was shown to change from low order (first or second order) to high order (up to eighth order) over the duration of a high speed vehicle brake test which involved up to thirty braking events. The pressure pulsation indicated a link to brake disc deformation with the magnitude and order of brake pressure variation increasing with increasing disc temperature. The highly dynamic, transient, nature of brake disc distortion was also investigated on a bespoke quarter car suspension brake dynamometer. Thermoelastic wave-like deformation was shown to occur during the process of a single braking event with the order of deformation corresponding to the brake pressure variation. The order of this wave-like deformation was shown to be linked to the amount of energy transferred into the braking system with higher energy braking events resulting in higher order deformation. Thermal images of the brake disc have shown an equispaced formation of hot-spots on the inboard and outboard friction ring surfaces which was linked to the disc waveform. The wave-like deformation was attributed to circumferential buckling of the brake disc as suggested by Lang [1]. This resulted from rapid thermal expansion of the friction rings due to the sudden - 4 - influx of heat during braking. Thermal gradients between the hot and cold regions of the brake disc constrained the radial thermal expansion of the friction ring and caused compressive stresses to build up. When the tangential load causing the stress was in excess of the critical buckling load, buckling of the brake disc occurred with the mode order of the buckled disc related to the temperature of the friction ring. Stress relieving of the brake disc was shown to occur during brake testing on the brake dynamometer causing a thermo-plastic effect. This “in service” stress relieving effect removed the retained stresses resulting from the casting and machining processes and allowed the disc to adopt a second order mode of deformation. Data from the on-vehicle and dynamometer testing was used to generate and validate finite element analysis simulations which were used to investigate thermal inputs and heat dissipation from the brake disc. These findings were then combined with that of an associated aerodynamic study [2] to generate a modified brake disc vent profile which reduced the surface temperature variation, thermal gradients and maximum disc temperature. On-vehicle testing of the prototype design showed an average 14 % reduction in maximum disc temperature and it was proposed that this would reduce the propensity for the disc <b>to</b> generate <b>judder</b> by reducing the thermal deformation of the brake disc.
