5|$|Each {{chapter of}} Yotsuba&! {{takes place on}} a specific, nearly {{sequential}} day of a common year starting on Wednesday. The year was initially believed to be 2003, coinciding with {{the date of the}} manga's serialization, but Azuma has stated that the manga always takes place in the present day. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> appearance of products created after 2003, such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty-two.|$|E
5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> models to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E
5|$|The {{functionality}} of a USB {{device is}} defined by a class code sent to a USB host. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> host {{to perform}} bus {{management}} action like enumerating new USB devices via retrieving the new device device descriptors. Retrieval {{of the device}} descriptors would especially allow for determining the USB Class, VID, and PID, which are often used for determining the correct USB driver for the device.|$|E
5|$|Though the Sega CD {{offers a}} faster processor, its main {{purpose is to}} expand {{the size of the}} games. Whereas ROM {{cartridges}} of the day typically contained 8 to 16 megabits of data, a CD-ROM disc can hold more than 640 megabytes of data, more than 320 times the storage of a Genesis cartridge. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> Sega CD to run games containing full motion video.|$|E
5|$|While diving, {{the emperor}} penguin's oxygen use is {{markedly}} reduced, as its heart rate {{is reduced to}} as low as 15–20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; <b>this</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> study of the chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but <b>this</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, {{the city}} of Northcrest merged with Lacy Lakeview; <b>this</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> {{consolidated}} area to qualify under Texas law for home rule status.|$|R

50|$|Tsubame KFC added oil based {{liquid cooling}} to reduce power consumption. <b>This</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> system to achieve world's best {{performance}} efficiencies of 4.5 gigaflops/watt.|$|R
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, <b>this</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Konoe and the {{military}} pushed a National Mobilization Law through <b>the</b> Diet. [...] <b>This</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> central government to control all manpower and material.|$|R

5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. <b>This</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
50|$|Engines were sourced {{from either}} the Dagenham or Bridgend plants. <b>This</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> factory to produce up to 75,000 {{vehicles}} annually, of which 50% were exported.|$|R
