40|$|<b>Thiamylal</b> {{is widely}} used for {{procedural}} sedation in emergency departments (ED); however, there are limited safety data for doses of <b>thiamylal</b> > 5 mg/kg in children. We investigated whether intravenous <b>thiamylal</b> in combination with local anesthetics is safe and effective for pediatric procedural sedation in the ED and to identify the association between increasing doses <b>thiamylal</b> and adverse events. Between July 2004 and June 2008, 227 children who underwent procedural sedation met the inclusion criteria, including 105 males (46. 3 %) and 122 females (53. 7 %). Facial laceration {{was the most common}} indication for procedural sedation. All children received an intravenous injection of <b>thiamylal,</b> with a loading dose of 5 mg/kg. Eighty-one children (35. 7 %) received a supplemental dose of 2. 5 mg/kg <b>thiamylal</b> because of inadequate sedation. Of these, 27 (11. 9 %) received a second supplemental dose of 2. 5 mg/kg because of inadequate sedation. Sixty-six patients (29. 1 %) experienced 75 mild and self-resolving adverse events, and most of which (15 / 75; 20 %) were drowsiness. Four (1. 8 %) patients experienced oxygen saturation below 96 %, which was related to the supplemental dose of <b>thiamylal</b> (p = 0. 002). No children suffered from any lasting or potentially serious complications. Our results indicate that intravenous <b>thiamylal</b> in combination with local anesthetic infiltration is a well tolerated for therapeutic procedures in the ED. <b>Thiamylal</b> offers rapid onset of sedation without compromising the patient's cardiorespiratory function during pediatric procedural sedation...|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} showed that propofol, but not <b>thiamylal,</b> counteracted the QTc {{interval}} prolongation during anesthesia induction with desflurane. On the other hand, the use of propofol and <b>thiamylal</b> during anesthesia induction with desflurane {{did not affect the}} QTcD. Thus, we believe that propofol is more suitable than <b>thiamylal</b> for anesthesia induction with desflurane in patients with risk factors for ventricular dysrhythmia.|$|E
40|$|Changes of <b>thiamylal</b> {{concentration}} in the lumbar and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after intravenous injection were studied on surgical and neurosurgical patients. <b>Thiamylal</b> sodium 5 mg/kg of body weight (induction dose of general anesthesia) was administered intravenously in all patients. Samples of lumbar CSF were obtained from 30 surgical patients through an indwelling catheter placed percutaneously into the lumbar subarachnoid space. Ventricular CSF was taken by neurosurgeons from 7 patients undergoing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. CSF samples were collected immediately before and 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90 minutes after the administration of <b>thiamylal.</b> Samples of blood were obtained simultaneously with CSF samples. The concentration of <b>thiamylal</b> in the blood and CSF was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results obtained were as follows: 1) <b>Thiamylal</b> levels in lumbar CSF increased gradually and showed the highest levels at 15 minutes (max. 0. 60 μg/ml) and then decreased. On the other hand, <b>thiamylal</b> concentrations in ventricular CSF took 30 miuntes to reach the highest levels (max. 1. 07 μg/ml) and decreased to a plateau thereafter. 2) When phenylephrine (0. 01, 0. 1, and 5 mg) was injected intrathecally, <b>thiamylal</b> levels in lumbar CSF decreased significantly in a dose dependent manner during the first 30 minutes. 3) The CSF/plasma ratio of <b>thiamylal</b> was identical in both lumbar and ventricular CSF during the first 15 minutes, and then increased significantly more in the ventricular CSF than in the lumbar CSF. 4) To investigate the effects of <b>thiamylal</b> in CSF on the central nervous system, evoked electrospinogram (EESG) was recorded epidurally with the bipolar leads stimulating the sciatic nerve in 8 cats lightly aesthetized by halothane. Direct <b>thiamylal</b> application to the subarachnoid space (12. 5 and 125 μg) did not alter either the amplitude or latency of EESG {{for a period of}} 30 minutes.

40|$|AbstractLimited {{reports are}} {{available}} in the literature on the impact of intravenous administration of anesthetics on laryngeal electromyographic (EMG) activity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the influence of the two commonly used intravenous anesthetics (propofol and <b>thiamylal)</b> on EMG amplitude evoked from the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid surgery. A total of 40 patients were randomized to receive a bolus of propofol (0. 5  mg/kg; n =  20) or <b>thiamylal</b> (1. 5  mg/kg; n =  20) to increase anesthetic depth when the surgeon found patient movement intraoperatively. Evoked potentials were obtained before and every 1  minute after the administration of each agent for up to 5  minutes by stimulating the RLN. The magnitude of evoked potentials at each time point and hemodynamic response were compared within groups. The mean amplitude of evoked potentials did not change significantly after administration of either propofol or <b>thiamylal</b> (p >  0. 05 within groups). Mean arterial pressure measured from 1  minute to 5  minutes was significantly lower in the propofol group than in the <b>thiamylal</b> group (p <  0. 05). Heart rate measured within 5  minutes did not differ significantly within groups. Low dose of propofol (0. 5  mg/kg) or <b>thiamylal</b> (1. 5  mg/kg) did not affect EMG readings during neuromonitoring of the RLN in thyroid surgery. Our results show that <b>thiamylal</b> provides better hemodynamic stability than propofol, and is therefore a preferable agent to increase anesthesia depth and prevent further patient movement during intraoperative neuromonitoring...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} level of {{anesthesia}} in three different intravenous anesthetics (<b>thiamylal,</b> ketamine,Alphadione?), the amplitude of the plethysmograph, EEG analysis and forearm skin and subcutaneous temperature were measured in 96 healthy men under three different conditions (spontaneous, during painful stimulation or with cold application on one forearm). <b>Thiamylal,</b> 4, 6 mg/kg and Alphadione?, 75, 100 μl/kg, produced increases in the amplitude of the plethysmograph in a dose-related manner, but ketamine did not. The increases in amplitude and the cessation of drift following the above two agents were terminated by painful stimulation before regaining of consciousness. Under the condition of cold application on the forearm, <b>thiamylal</b> and Alphadione? increased the amplitude in only the forearm with the cold application. Among intermittent intravenous administrations of the drugs, only Alphadione? 75 μl/kg increased the amplitude of the phethysmograph in all cases studied. In EEG bandpass filter analysis, the values of σ 1 +θ were {{closely related to the}} depth of anesthesia with <b>thiamylal,</b> 4 or 6 mg/kg, but not to those with Alphadione? and ketamine. Although the skin and subcutaneous temperature of the forearm rose after the administration of <b>thiamylal</b> 6 mg/kg, they did not with the cold application to the forearm. Alphadione? 75 or 100 μl/kg caused a slight rise in both temperatures under both conditions. These results suggest that the amplitude of the plethysmograph could be a useful guide in diagnosing {{the level of}} anesthesia with <b>thiamylal</b> and Alphadione?. The value of σ 1 +θ using EEG bandpass filter analysis were also valid for <b>thiamylal</b> anesthesia, but because of slow and small changes in forearm skin and subcutanesus temperatures after intravenous anesthetic injection, these temperatures changes were difficult to use as a guide to the depth of anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Objective : To compare {{acute and}} {{long-term}} postoperative pain and side effects in patients undergoing mastectomy {{for breast cancer}} under general anesthesia induced with ketamine or <b>thiamylal.</b> Methods : Twenty four ASA physical status I - III patients undergoing mastectomy {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two groups. Ketamine group received intrave nous ketamine, 1 mg/kg, and <b>thiamylal</b> group received intravenous <b>thiamylal,</b> 4 mg/kg, at the induction of general an esthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, N 2 O and fentanyl. The intensity of pain was assessed by using visual analog scale (VAS) 3 and 16 hr and 2, 3 and 4 weeks after surgery. Postoperative side effects, including nausea, vomiting and hallucination were also recorded. Results : At 16 hr after surgery, VAS in ketamine group was signif i cantly lower than that in <b>thiamylal</b> group. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the VAS at 3 hr and 2, 3 and 4 weeks after surgery. There were no differences in the incidence of side effects such as nausea, vomiting and hallucination between the two groups.

AdditIonal Keyphrases:monitoring therapy. drug assay barbiturates <b>Thiamylal</b> (Surital#{ 174 },Parke-Davis) and thiopental (Pentothal#{ 174 },Abbott) are both drugs that are used principally as “sedative-hypnotics ” to produce sleep. They are thiobarbiturates and chemically are very similar, the only structural difference is that one con-tains an allyl group where the other contains an ethyl group. Both <b>thiamylal</b> and thiopental are classified as ultrashort-acting agents and are used principally to induce an anesthetic state in conjunction with nitrous oxide or other inhalation anesthetics. Although deep sleep is of short duration, sedative effects persist for hours. Thus, it is desirable to accurately monitor the concentrations of barbiturates {{in the blood of}} patients during and after anesthesia. Several procedures have been published for detecting and measuring barbiturates in biological fluids: spec-trophotometric (1, 2), spectrofluorometric (3), or gas-chromatographic (4 - 8).

30|$|The {{present study}} had several limitations. Although manual {{measurement}} using a digitizer {{is the standard}} method to assess the QT interval, we used QT automatic analysis software. This software shows superior reproducibility and a few differences from manual measurements [29]. Although we did not prove that 5  mg/kg <b>thiamylal</b> was equipotent to 1.5  mg/kg propofol, our previous study showed that these doses of <b>thiamylal</b> and propofol decreased BIS to the same level during total intravenous anesthesia induction using them [2]. Although desflurane is known to prolong the QT interval significantly [11, 30], we never actually measured the QT interval during anesthesia induction in a desflurane-alone study population. However, desflurane is not generally administrated as the sole agent for anesthesia induction because of its potential to cause airway irritation. Furthermore, ETdes had not been maintained at a stable level. However, ETdes at T 4 was measured during ventilation by face mask, {{on the other hand}} that at T 5 was measured during ventilation by endotracheal tube.|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of a {{comparative clinical trial}} of thiopentone, buthalitone, hexo-barbitone and <b>thiamylal,</b> which extended over five years and {{was carried out by}} twenty-three anaesthetists.

Sevoflurane inhalation caused a decrease in systolic arterial pressure with an unchanged heart rate, and attenuated the pressor and tachycardia response to tracheal intubation {{to a greater extent than}} that observed in the control and isoflurane group. Plasma norepinephrine did not show any change in the sevoflurane group. Isoflurane induction increased the sympathoadrenal activity, resulting in marked tachycardia, but attenuated the pressor response to tracheal intubation. Sevoflurane caused milder hemodynamic change during inhalation and tracheal intubation, and was accompanied by stable plasma catecholamine levels, indicating a suppression of sympathoadrenal activity...|$|E
30|$|In all patients, {{sedation}} {{was performed}} with midazolam (1  mg) and fentanyl citrate (100  μg) followed by induction with <b>thiamylal</b> sodium (3 – 4  mg/kg), esmolol hydrochloride (1  mg/kg), and vecuronium bromide (0.1  mg/kg) {{immediately after the}} radial artery was cannulated. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.5 % and intermittent fentanyl and vecuronium injections {{at the discretion of}} anesthesiologist. After induction, intubation was performed with a single-lumen tube (Parker Flex-Tip™ PFHV, Japan Medicalnext, Osaka, Japan) and bronchial blocker tube (COOPDECH Endobronchial Blocker Tube, Daiken Medical, Osaka, Japan) or a double-lumen tube (Mallinckrodt™ Endobronchial Tube, Covidien Japan, Tokyo, Japan) for one-lung ventilation. A pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo V, Edwards Lifescience Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted via the left internal jugular vein. An 18 -gauge intravenous line was inserted via the right internal jugular vein in order to facilitate placement of the cannula to drain venous flow from the superior vena cava during cardiopulmonary bypass. For the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, 300  units/kg of unfractionated heparin was administered to achieve activated coagulation time of more than 400  s. Routine monitoring included continuous arterial, central venous, and pulmonary artery pressure, pulse oximetry, five-lead electrocardiogram, regional saturation of oxygen of brain (INVOS OXIMETER, Covidien Japan, Tokyo, Japan), bladder temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, airway pressure, and transesophageal echocardiography (EPIQ 7, Philips Electronics Japan, Tokyo, Japan).|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} profiles for metharbital, butabarbital, thiopental and <b>thiamylal</b> {{were determined}} in ethanol- water solvent systems at 25 c, {{in an attempt}} to define an approximate correlation between therapeutic activity and various solubility relationships. The relative lipophilicity of a drug molecule {{is an important factor in}} the physical and chemical processes involved when the therapeutic agent is introduced into a biological system. Binary solvent mixtures aid in delineating the relative polarity, in terms of dielectric constants, of these drugs. Spectrophotometric and, where applicable, gravimetric analyses, were utilized to determine the concentration of drug, in mg. /ml., in the 41 solvent systems ranging in composition from pure ethanol to pure water. The dielectric requirement (DR) of the barbiturates investigated, and those reported for barbital and vinbarbital, illustrated an approximate inverse relationship with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. A similar correlation was found with the solubilities in pure water, and the ratios of the solubilities in ethanol and at the DR to the solubility in water. The therapeutic indices of duration of action and the period of time involved between administration of the drug and the time when the activity is first manifested increased as the relative polarity of these barbiturates declined. The duration of these pharmacological parameters were also found to increase with a corresponding reduction in the hydrophilic nature of this series of compounds...|$|E
40|$|Background: Monitoring {{hypnotic}} depth is used {{to prevent}} awareness during general anesthesia. We used the A-line ARX index (AAI) to assess the effect of shortterm inhalation of sevoflurane {{in the prevention of}} intubation-induced inadequate hypnotic depth during anesthetic induction. Methods: Thirty patients were randomly divided into the sevoflurane and non-sevoflurane groups, both of which were given 3 µg kg- 1 fentanyl, 4 mg kg- 1 <b>thiamylal,</b> and 0. 2 mg kg- 1 cis-atracurium intravenously to induce general anesthesia. The sevoflurane group then inhaled 6 % sevoflurane and 4 L/min O 2 for 3 minutes, whereas the non-sevoflurane group was given 4 L/min O 2 alone. Both groups were intubated 3 minutes after induction. Measurements of theAAI, non-invasive blood pressure, and heart rate were performed everyminute, starting 3 minutes prior to induction until 9 minutes after intubation. Results: Intubation induced a significant AAI elevation in the non-sevoflurane group(47. 13 Ų 20. 88, 48. 13 Ų 20. 05, 40. 87 Ų 15. 86 and 31. 27 Ų 15. 26 at 1, 2, 3 and 4 minutes after intubation, respectively, vs. 17. 67 Ų 6. 44 at 3 minutesafter induction; p < 0. 05), whereas the AAI remained unchanged for thesevoflurane group following intubation. Moreover, the non-sevofluranegroup demonstrated higher AAI values after intubation compared with thesevoflurane group. There {{were no significant differences in}} blood pressureand heart rate between the two groups throughout the study. Conclusion: Adding 6 % sevoflurane with 4 L/min O 2 for 3 minutes during the inductionperiod prevented inadequate hypnotic depth caused by intubation but was notsufficient to inhibit fluctuations in hemodynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{cerebral}} {{effects of}} 60 per cent (end-tidal concentration) nitrous oxide (N_ 2 O) {{were examined in}} 29 dogs. With the inhalation of N_ 2 O, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) increased, reaching a peak of 203 per cent of the control value at 7 minutes, and thereafter decreased gradually to 125 per cent of the control over a 60 minute-period. The mean cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMR_O 2) increased to about 120 per cent of the control value within 15 minutes and remained elevated during the inhalation of N_ 2 O. There was no {{significant change in the}} mean arterial pressure (MAP), but a significant reduction in cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) was observed. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed low voltage, slow wave activity with the inhalation of N 20. After the intravenous injection of thiamyla 1 (8 mg/kg), N_ 2 O increased neither the CBF nor CMR_O 2 for the first 30 minute-period, but produced predominant slow wave activity during the period. Pretreatment with reserpine (total 1. 0 mg/kg) did not modify significantly the cerebral circulatory, metabolic and electrographic effects of N_ 2 O. The cerebral responses to the alteration in Paco_ 2 did not differ significantly during increased metabolism with N_ 2 O from the control without N_ 2 O. In conclusion, N_ 2 O is a cerebral metabolic stimulant which accompanies the increase in the CBF, and EEG slowing. The cerebral circulatory and metabolic stimulation was blocked by prior administration of <b>thiamylal</b> but not by pretreatment with reserpine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe tegumental allergen-like (TAL) {{proteins}} from Schistosoma mansoni {{are part}} of a family of calcium binding proteins found only in parasitic flatworms. These proteins have attracted interest as potential drug or vaccine targets, yet comparatively little is known about their biochemistry. Here, we compared the biochemical properties of three members of this family: SmTAL 1 (Sm 22. 6), SmTAL 2 (Sm 21. 7) and SmTAL 3 (Sm 20. 8). Molecular modelling suggested that, despite similarities in domain organisation, there are differences in the three proteins’ structures. SmTAL 1 was predicted to have two functional calcium binding sites and SmTAL 2 was predicted to have one. Despite the presence of two EF-hand-like structures in SmTAL 3, neither was predicted to be functional. These predictions were confirmed by native gel electrophoresis, intrinsic fluorescence and differential scanning fluorimetry: both SmTAL 1 and SmTAL 2 are able to bind calcium ions reversibly, but SmTAL 3 is not. SmTAL 1 is also able to interact with manganese, strontium, iron(II) and nickel ions. SmTAL 2 has a different ion binding profile interacting with cadmium, manganese, magnesium, strontium and barium ions in addition to calcium. All three proteins form dimers and, in contrast to some Fasciola hepatica proteins from the same family; dimerization is not affected by calcium ions. SmTAL 1 interacts with the anti-schistosomal drug praziquantel and the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine and W 7. SmTAL 2 interacts only with W 7. SmTAL 3 interacts with the aforementioned calmodulin antagonists and <b>thiamylal,</b> but not praziquantel. Overall, these data suggest that the proteins have different biochemical properties and thus, most likely, different in vivo functions...|$|E
