5|$|Harry Potter pundit John Granger {{additionally}} {{noted that}} one of the reasons the Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|The Oakridge {{students}} are placed into learning groups named after animals. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) initially suspects her daughter Juanita (Madison De La Garza), {{who is in}} the Leopards, is among the slow group, whereas Susan (Teri Hatcher) is pleased that her son M.J. (Mason Vale Cotton) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' homework and studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes are slow. When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, and the secret code of the animal groups becomes widespread. While Susan and Gabrielle wait to talk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal,</b> they both admit they got carried away and confess fears that they are letting their kids down.|$|E

Among these operations was the return of the squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois from the Indian Ocean, which was captured at the Action of 13 March 1806; the raiding cruises of L'Hermite's expedition and Lamellerie's expedition, which captured {{a number of}} merchant ships but each lost a frigate breaking through the blockade of the French coast; and the destruction of a convoy of seven French ships destined with supplies for the French West Indies at the Action of 25 September 1806.|$|E
5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms {{scattered over the}} two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to {{the east side of the}} house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> dining room and bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether a correlation exists between <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> leadership style and both a) performance level and b) <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> effectiveness in schools in Dubai. It also investigated whether the correlations change according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> gender, years of experience, {{and the level}} of the school (primary, intermediate, and secondary). Data on principals’ leadership styles and effectiveness were collected through Avolio and Bass’ (1995) Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) completed by teachers in 34 government schools. Data on school performance were obtained from the 2010 Dubai Schools Inspection Bureau report. The study found that the transformational leadership style was most frequently employed, followed by the transactional style, and then the passive or avoidant style. The study found a positive correlation between <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> leadership style and his/her effectiveness, but found no correlation with school performance. Finally, principal style and effectiveness differed according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> gender and <b>the</b> level of the school, but not according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal’s</b> years of experience. Findings of this study open a new area of research on school principalship, performance, and effectiveness in the UAE...|$|R

5|$|Additionally, the {{geographic}} {{location of the}} city, with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> storm tracks, is especially favorable {{which is why it}} has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E

King Andriamasinavalona decreed that within the capital city, the Zanaralambo would live in the area delimited by Ambohitsoa to the southwest, Ambodivoanonoka to the east, and Andohalokely in the north. Outside the capital, each group had its designated villages. The Andriamboninolona lived in Ambohitromby, Fieferana, Ambohipiainana and Ambohitriniandriana. The Andriandranando lived in Soamanandrarina, Betsizaraina, Ambohibe, Ihadiambola and Akadindramamy. Finally, the Zanaralambo inhabited Lazaina, Ambatofotsy and Masindray.|$|E
