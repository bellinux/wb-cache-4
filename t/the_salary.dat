5|$|However, some job {{still had}} to be found for Chotiner, who had wound up his California {{practice}} and sold his home. Haldeman refused to have him in the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval. On April 10, 1969, acting Special Representative for Trade Negotiations Theodore R. Gates appointed Chotiner as General Counsel to his office, as almost simultaneously, the White House announced Gates' replacement, Carl J. Gilbert. On April 1, Nixon had issued Executive Order 11463, making the position of general counsel in that office a Schedule C, or political appointment, and significantly raising <b>the</b> <b>salary</b> of the position.

The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2–3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income growth for the lowest 20th percentile of citizens, 3–5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens.

40|$|Excerpt] In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> of three important municipal officials; city-managers, police chiefs, and fire chiefs.

Two of these measures of performance are developed in the study. Further, the influence of the city-manager form of government on the incentive structure facing police chiefs and fire chiefs, and the interdependence betwen <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> of police chiefs and fire chiefs is investigated.

40|$|Estimating <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> of {{professional}} athletes {{has received a}} substantial amount of attention both in the press and in academic journals. A statistical technique {{that can be used to}} obtain an estimate of a player’s salary with a given set of performance characteristics is the classical least squares regression analysis. This technique does not work well, however, if the data upon which the model is based contain outliers or are not normally distributed. In this paper we focus our attention on <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> of American League baseball players in 2007 and demonstrate the usefulness of an alternative estimation approach – that of quantile regression analysis. Our results indicate that ordinary least squares regression overestimates <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> of poor players, and underestimates <b>the</b> <b>salaries</b> of star players. This, we believe, is a compelling reason to apply quantile regression in the prediction of baseball player salaries...|$|R

5|$|The {{failure of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt {{led to the}} {{tightening}} of Umayyad control over Iraq. Al-Hajjaj founded a permanent garrison for the Syrian troops at Wasit, situated between Basra and Kufa, and the Iraqis, regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region. This was coupled with a reform of <b>the</b> <b>salary</b> (ʿaṭāʾ) system by al-Hajjaj: whereas hitherto <b>the</b> <b>salary</b> had been calculated based {{on the role of}} one's ancestors in the early Muslim conquests, it now became limited to those actively participating in campaigns. As most of the army was now composed of Syrians, this measure gravely injured the interests of the Iraqis, who regarded this as another impious attack on hallowed institutions. In addition, extensive land reclamation and irrigation works were undertaken in lower Iraq (the Sawad), but this was limited mostly to around Wasit, and the proceeds went to the Umayyads and their clients, not the Iraqi nobility. As a result, the political power of the once mighty Kufan élites was soon broken.|$|E
