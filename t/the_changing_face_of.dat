25|$|The {{immediate}} and specific source for his romances are uncertain. He speaks in the vaguest {{way of the}} materials he used, and though Celtic influence is detectable in the stories, {{there is no direct}} evidence that he had Celtic written sources. Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who {{play an important role in}} Chrétien's narratives. One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source in the case of Béroul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150. However, Chrétien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day. And Chrétien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry. Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chrétien was influenced by <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> secular and canonical law in the 12th century. This is particularly relevant for his Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chrétien's day.|$|E

40|$|Recreation {{professionals}} continually {{strive to}} serve a host of diverse program con-stituents, while leisure researchers attempt to uncover barriers to leisure participation. Much of the barriers or constraints research {{has come from the}} perspective of program participants. This study identified, from the perspectives and experiences of 18 recre-ation professionals, the issues and barriers that they perceive inhibit recreation program access and availability to diverse constituents, particularly ethnic minority populations. Co-cultural theory, which integrates the concepts of muted group theory and standpoint theory, was utilized as the study’s theoretical framework. In-depth interviews were uti-lized. Five primary barriers were identified that related to <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> management and staff, deferred program responsibil-ity, language barriers, and negative attitudes and stereotypes held by some management and staff. This article demonstrates how these barriers impact leisure participation for disenfranchised groups. The findings suggest that recreation agencies, often unwittingly or unknowingly, foster organizational barriers that inhibit the perceived program acces-sibility or attractiveness to ethnic minorities. Implications for research and professional practice are explored...|$|R
