2500|$|Probably, {{the most}} {{well-known}} teratogenic drug is thalidomide. It was developed {{near the end of}} the 1950s by Chemie Grűnenthal as a sleep inducing aid and antiemetic. Because of its ability to prevent nausea it was prescribed for pregnant women in almost 50 countries worldwide between 1956–1962. Until William McBride published the study leading to its withdrawal from the market at 1961, about 8- 10 000 severely malformed children were born. The most typical disorder induced by thalidomide were reductional deformities of the long bones of the extremities. Phocomelia otherwise a rare deformity, which therefore helped to recognise the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of the new drug. Among other malformations caused by thalidomide were those of ears, eyes, brain, kidney, heart, digestive and respiratory tract. 40% of the prenatally affected children died soon after birth. As thalidomide is used today as a treatment for multiple myeloma and leprosy, several births of affected children were described in spite of the [...] strictly required use of contraception among female patients treated by it.|$|E

25|$|Clinically, {{thalidomide}} {{has always}} {{been used as a}} racemate. Generally the S-isomer is associated with the infamous <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of thalidomide and the R-isomer is devoid of the teratogenic properties but conveys the sedative effects, however this view is highly debated and {{it has been argued that}} the animal model that these different R- and S-effects were seen in was not sensitive to the thalidomide <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> Later reports in rabbits, which is a sensitive species, unveiled <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> from both isomers. Moreover, thalidomide enantiomers have been shown to be interconversed in vivo due to the acidic chiral hydrogen in the asymmetric center (shown, for the EM-12 analog, in Figure 3), so the plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> will most likely be in vain.|$|R

40|$|Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} that are extensively used in agriculture as pesticides. As such, humans and wildlife are undoubtedly exposed to these chemicals. Although DTCs {{are thought to be}} relatively safe due to their short half lives, it is well established that they are teratogenic to vertebrates, especially to fish. In zebrafish, these <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> are characterized by distorted notochord development and shortened anterior to posterior axis. DTCs are known copper (Cu) chelators but this does not fully explain the observed <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> We show here that DTCs cause malformations in zebrafish that highly resemble <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> observed by direct inhibition of a group of cuproenzymes termed lysyl oxidases (LOX). Additionally, we demonstrate that partial knockdown of three LOX genes, lox, loxl 1 and loxl 5 b, sensitizes the developing embryo to DTC exposure. Finally, we show that DTCs directly inhibit zebrafish LOX activity in an ex vivo amine oxidase assay. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that DTC induced <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> are, at least in part, caused by direct inhibition of LOX activity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

50|$|Polgas was {{initially}} a normal dog which walked on all fours, albeit one who wore shirts and undershirts like Dagul. Medina eventually {{gave him the}} ability to talk, followed by other human characteristics like a more human-like physique. Originally, Brosia, a former ventriloquist, supplied Polgas's voice, but Medina was so dissatisfied {{with the idea that}} he abandoned it completely. Medina later explained in a 1995 spin-off graphic novel entitled Pirata that Polgas developed human characteristics due to his master's exotic version of bibingka (rice cake) and exposure to radiation emitted by television sets. Apparently, the combination had a <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effect</b> on him, somewhat similar to the mutation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{believed}} that the drug thalidomide binds and inactivates cereblon, which leads to an antiproliferative effect on myeloma cells and a <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effect</b> on fetal development. Thalidomide {{was used as a}} treatment for morning sickness from 1957 until 1961 but was withdrawn from the market after it was discovered that it caused birth defects. [...] It is estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 children were affected. [...] However, the finding that cereblon inhibition is responsible for the teratogenic activity of thalidomide in the chick and zebrafish was cast into doubt due to a 2013 report that pomalidomide (a more potent thalidomide analog) does not cause teratogenic effects in these same model systems even though it is a stronger cereblon inhibitor than thalidomide is.|$|E

5000|$|In animal {{experiments}} diphenylamine {{was rapidly}} and completely absorbed after ingestion by mouth. It underwent metabolism to sulphonyl and glucuronyl conjugates and was rapidly excreted mainly via urine. Acute oral and dermal toxicity were low. Diphenylamine can cause severe irritation to the eyes. It {{was not a}} skin irritant, {{and it has not}} been technically feasible to test acute toxicity study by inhalation. Diphenylamine targets the red blood cell system and can cause abnormal erythropoiesis in the spleen, and thus congestion of the spleen, and haemosiderosis. Changes in liver and kidneys were found upon longer exposure. At clear toxic doses of parent animals reproductive effects were limited to reduced implantation sites in F1 females associated with reduced rat litter size, implicating a possible mutagenic or <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effect.</b> No effect on development could be attributed. The U.S. CDC's NIOSH lists the following symptoms of poisoning: irritation eyes, skin, mucous membrane; eczema; tachycardia, hypertension; cough, sneezing; methemoglobinemia; increased blood pressure and heart rate; proteinuria, hematuria (blood in the urine), bladder injury; in animals: teratogenic effects ...|$|E

40|$|Gestational folate {{deficiency}} {{has been}} associated with abnormal growth and development in both experimental animal and human studies and has been postulated as a putative mechanism for the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Animal {{studies have shown that the}} administration of AEDs results in folate depletion and <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> Attempts to prevent the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of AEDs by coadministration of folate have shown variable results, perhaps because of a lack of understanding about the specific effects of AEDs on folate metabolism. Our prospective study of women with epilepsy showed that blood folate levels decreased with increasing plasma AED levels and with the number of AEDs. Low blood folate levels before and/or early in pregnancy were significantly associated with spontaneous abortion and the occurrence of developmental anomalies in the offspring. These findings suggest that folate supplementation might be one means of preventing the occurrence of abnormal pregnancy outcome in women with epilepsy, including neural-tube defects in the offsprin...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{conducted}} on pregnant Wistar rats show that chlorophos (Dipterex) has embroyotoxic and <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> after oral introduction in a 80 mg/kg dose during a critical period of embryogenesis. Embryotoxic and <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> are absent during {{the introduction of}} 8 mg/kg of the pesticide. The oral introduction of phthalophos (Imidan) in a 30 mg/kg dose once on day 9 of pregnancy {{and the introduction of}} a 1. 5 mg/kg dose daily throughout the course of pregnancy caused increased postimplantation mortality of embryos. A dose of 30 mg/kg of phthalophos on day 9 or day 13 of pregnancy causes developmental abnormalities, including hyponathia and hydrocephaly. A 0. 06 mg/kg phthalophos dose does not affect the course of embryogenesis in white rats. Thus the organophosphate pesticides Dipterex and Imidan exhibit embryotoxic and <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> at doses which significantly exceed the actual amounts of the pesticide that can enter the human organism.

(12 hours). It is possible that by indirect offert (via mother) the appearance of developmental abnormalities asks for a longer time period. For this reason we considered that new investigationes regarding the teratogenic potential of copper upon early postimplantational period (day 9 of gestation), are period with a high sensitivity to the teratogenic action of exogenous factors.

40|$|Background: The August 2013 {{publication}} of a large historical cohort study in the New England Journal of Medicine has reignited interest in the potential <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of fluconazole when used in pregnant females. Fluconazole is an effective and commonly-utilized antifungal medication. Thus, maternal and fetal exposure to fluconazole is expected in the general population, and pharmacists are expected to counsel patients regarding any risks to their prescribed treatment. Methods: A literature review of all published literature indexed to PubMed (January 1966 to October 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (January 1975 to October 2013) including fluconazole and <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> and published in the English language was conducted. Results: Fourteen publications were included for analysis including case reports (n= 7), cross-sectional research (n= 2), and historical cohort studies (n= 5). Conclusion: There appears to be little to no fetal risk resulting from a single dose or short duration antifungal therapy with fluconazole. However, prolonged high-dose fluconazole therapy has increased potential to confer <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> In those cases, the risks of such therapy should be weighed against potential benefits...|$|R
