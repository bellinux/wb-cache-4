5|$|In Cuba, {{evacuations}} {{were ordered}} for Nueva Gerona on Isla de la Juventud, and for 113,754people on the mainland. Cattle were moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> {{location for the}} storm's passage. President Fidel Castro {{declared a state of}} emergency in four western provinces due to the threat to the local sugar industry.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{majority}} of all subway delays are caused by signal problems. Whenever a track circuit stops working, all of the signals which are affected by it turn red, as it is uncertain {{whether there is a}} train in that section, and the system properly reverts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> state.|$|E

5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> place to train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Graham is told by Crawford {{that they}} have cracked Lecktor's coded message to the Tooth Fairy—it is Graham's home address with an {{instruction}} to kill Graham and his family. Graham rushes home to find his family safe but terrified. After the FBI moves Graham's family <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> house, he tries to explain to his son Kevin why he had retired previously.|$|E
5|$|Inchon {{begins with}} North Korean {{soldiers}} moving past the 38th parallel north into South Korea in June 1950. People flee into the country's capital, Seoul. One of the displaced people is Barbara Hallsworth (Jacqueline Bisset), a U.S. Army major's wife {{who lives in}} a village on the 38th Parallel. She is chauffeured to Seoul in a limousine, picking up five South Korean children along the way. After her chauffeur is killed, she drives them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> location called the Inn of the Sixth Happiness. Along the way, she shoots a North Korean soldier.|$|E

5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still afloat after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, {{it might have been}} possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> harbor.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|Samantha tells Mulder {{that the}} Bounty Hunter and the clones are {{actually}} aliens, and the Bounty Hunter will begin chasing her {{as soon as}} he has killed the remaining clones. Meanwhile, Scully heads to a hotel to hide from the Bounty Hunter. Returning to the lab, she finds four more clones, who claim to be the last. Scully arranges for them to be transported <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> place, but the Bounty Hunter follows her and watches. At her hotel room, Scully lets in a man who seems to be Mulder, only to receive {{a phone call from the}} actual Mulder soon after.|$|E
50|$|The acrorhagi of Actinia bermudensis {{are used}} to {{discourage}} other individuals from moving into the anemone's territory. Intruding anemones are not normally killed but usually retire <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> place.|$|R

5|$|Several {{months after}} the Governor's attack, a deadly flu kills many of the {{population}} at the prison. The Governor finds his former right-hand men and kills them, taking over their group and destroys the prison. Rick's group are forced to separate and flee, but not before Hershel and the Governor are killed. The survivors divide, face their own trials and meet new faces before finding signs pointing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> haven called Terminus. One by one, they reunite at Terminus, but all the group are captured for some unknown purpose.|$|E
5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> altitude while the problem was solved.|$|E
5|$|The other militia men {{traveled}} on land {{to find the}} place where the Margaretta was anchored and demanded surrender. After refusing to surrender, Moore sailed to where the Polly was anchored and attempted to recover her. There was an inconsequential exchange of gunfire with the militia men who were located on the shore, and Moore was able to raise anchor and travel <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> anchorage. The remaining men armed themselves with muskets, pitchforks, and axes to set out after the Margaretta.|$|E

5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{across the}} eastern Caribbean issued {{hurricane}} warnings {{as far south}} as Montserrat. In Anguilla, residents near the coast were advised to evacuate. Schools closed ahead of the storm, and the ferry between the island and Saint Martin was halted and moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> location. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the National Emergency Management Agency was activated on November16. Officials there advised residents living near ghauts to evacuate, and one shelter was located in each district of the country. In addition, stores were open for longer hours to allow people to stock up on supplies. Most businesses and schools were closed in Antigua and Barbuda during the storm, while in Dominica, the airport was closed. Further south, there was little warning for the hurricane in Grenada, and most people left their boats in the water.|$|E

5|$|Hospitalman Third Class (then Hospitalman) Phil Isadore Valdez, from New Mexico, was posthumously {{awarded the}} Navy Cross {{for his actions}} on January 29, 1967. On that date Valdez ran over seventy-five yards of open terrain, under {{constant}} enemy fire, to aid a fallen Marine. He then moved the wounded man <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> area and, quickly and competently, rendered medical assistance. Again exposing himself to enemy fire, Valdez moved across approximately fifty yards of open ground to another Marine. While treating the second Marine, he positioned himself between {{the man and the}} hostile fire. It was at this time that Valdez was mortally wounded by enemy small-arms fire.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Lisbon convoy, {{a number of other}} vulnerable British targets were in the region, including a second convoy from the Mediterranean Sea under Rear-Admiral Philip Cosby en route to Britain and the first-rate HMS Victory, which was sailing independently with Lord Hood on board. Nielly had information concerning these movements, and was cruising in a pattern that was intended to cover the Western approaches to the English Channel. The French force cruised in the Celtic Sea for several days, until on 6 November at 02:30 two unidentified ships were spotted on the northeastern horizon. These vessels were the British 74-gun ships of the line HMS Alexander under Captain Richard Rodney Bligh and HMS Canada under Captain Charles Powell Hamilton, returning northeastwards to rejoin the Channel Fleet after escorting a Lisbon and Mediterranean bound convoy <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> latitude.|$|E
5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her maneuverability, allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow President to proceed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President {{as she tried to}} escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E
