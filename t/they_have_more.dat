5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are {{already beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>more</b> than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
5|$|For the Narnians, Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance, as {{they have}} been forced into the forests. He also decided to {{increase}} the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races. The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> leather and jewellery, and a darker colour scheme in their costumes. Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable. The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords. The satyrs were redesigned, as their creation on the first film had been rushed. 4,600 make-up jobs were performed, which Berger believes is a record.|$|E

5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|The wasps {{preferentially}} {{hunt for}} female cicadas because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> consumable tissue, but male cicadas {{are easier to}} locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly hunt for Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them to hunt for cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly into the trees to feed on sap, and the species {{has been known to}} feed on nectar.|$|E

5|$|Porto {{have won}} 27 league titles – {{including}} an unparalleled series of five consecutive top-place finishes from 1994 to 1999 – {{and lifted the}} Taça de Portugal on 16 occasions. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira trophies (20) than every other winning club combined. Internationally, Porto is the most successful Portuguese club, {{with a total of}} seven titles. Former captain João Pinto and striker Fernando Gomes hold the club records for most appearances (587) and goals (352), respectively. In international competitions, these records belong respectively to Vítor Baía (99) and Radamel Falcao (22). Baía is also the club's most successful player, with a total of 25 titles. José Maria Pedroto is the club's longest-serving coach, overseeing 327 matches in nine seasons.|$|E
5|$|Ray's {{last three}} films, made after his {{recovery}} and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly indoors, {{and have a}} distinctive style. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People) is an adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree). In it, an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.|$|E

25|$|Because {{wirewound}} resistors are coils <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> undesirable inductance {{than other}} types of resistor, although winding the wire in sections with alternately reversed direction can minimize inductance.

25|$|Since 2010, {{the rate}} of {{increase}} was of 0.3% in the Americas and Europe. On the other hand, Eric Kaufman, of University of London, argued that the main reason for expansion of Catholicism and conservative Protestantism along with other religions is because their religions tend to be “pro-natal” and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> children, and not due to religious conversion.|$|E
25|$|Most, but not all, of the {{participants}} are post-menopausal women and the older women are {{the leaders of the}} most challenging behaviors. Post-menopausal women are of key importance because they are believed not to be vulnerable to witchcraft which may take away their fertility, because they have esteem in their communities, and because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> time for activities.|$|E
