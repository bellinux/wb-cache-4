Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E

25|$|As Hercules {{had evolved}} from the fixed-base Ajax system, early {{deployments}} offered no mobility. However, both Ajax and Hercules systems in Europe had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> as US forces shifted. This led {{to the use of}} semi-trailer systems for the fire control systems, which could be easily moved and re-positioned as required. LOPAR was relatively small, and the TTR/MTR were always trailer based, so these systems were also fairly mobile. The problem was the missile launcher itself, and especially the large HIPAR radar, which presented a formidable mobility problem.|$|E

25|$|An {{official}} trial service {{began on}} the railway after inauguration in October 2016. At that time, the railway was still not fully operational.

25|$|In June 1933, the Reinhardt Program was introduced. It was an {{extensive}} infrastructure development project that combined indirect incentives, such as tax reductions, with direct public investment in waterways, railroads and highways. The Reinhardt Program {{was followed by}} other similar initiatives, with the result that, between 1933 and 1936, the German construction industry was greatly expanded. In 1933, only 666,000 Germans worked in construction, and by 1936, the number had increased to 2,000,000. In particular, road construction was expanding at a very rapid pace. This was part of Hitler's war preparations: Germany needed a state-of-the-art highway system in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> troops and materials quickly. As a side effect, cars {{and other forms of}} motorized transport became increasingly attractive to the population. Therefore, the German car industry also experienced a boom in the 1930s.|$|E

Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> independently, but it was rewritten to save on animation costs.

[...] In a tactically brilliant battle at Hannah's Cowpens on January 17, 1781, Morgan decisively defeated Tarleton, capturing most of his force. [...] News of the battle so upset the earl that he was reported to snap a sword. [...] He wrote that [...] "he late affair has almost broke my heart", and vowed to recover the prisoners Morgan had taken. [...] Immediately giving chase, he was unable to gain on Morgan, who, although burdened with prisoners, was not burdened by a large baggage train. [...] Cornwallis, in a move calculated to force his army <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> faster, ordered most of his baggage train destroyed on January 24.

500|$|When [...] {{was known}} as Metal Gear Solid: Rising, former {{producer}} Shigenobu Matsuyama hinted that Raiden's past as a child soldier would be elaborated and his weaknesses as a human would be explored. Matsuyama wanted Raiden to have as strong {{a role in the}} game as in Metal Gear Solid 2, leading him to become the game's main character. Director Mineshi Kimura noted that he wanted Raiden <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> like he did in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailers, wanting to show [...] "the stealth of the sword, and the strength of not even losing to the gun, and the fear and power you have with this blade." [...] Matsuyama stated that they would focus on Raiden's strong will and physical strength, so he would be enjoyable to control. Raiden's design was changed during the game's development, leading to different promotional images of him. Following the game's reboot into a spin-off, Developers stated that while Raiden [...] "has grown up" [...] in comparison to previous Metal Gear games, he is still conflicted with his life as a child soldier in a past civil war, leading him to be a [...] "dark hero". Shinkawa designed Raiden's new body as a way to emphasize him being a dark hero contrasting his Metal Gear Solid 4 persona and later discussed with Platinum Games' Kenji Saito about including his quasi-human look. Raiden losing an eye also serves to represent his transformation across the story. In response to complaints regarding how Rising appeared to contradict Raiden's ending in Guns of the Patriots, the Kojima Productions staff explained the game would explain what happened with Raiden's life.|$|E
