25|$|Speed {{cushions}} are a type {{of speed}} hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across {{the width of the}} road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle <b>the</b> <b>cushions</b> without slowing down.|$|E
25|$|Experimental warming {{has been}} shown to start {{flowering}} substantially earlier than control cushions experiencing ambient temperature. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs and capsules (fruits) matured earlier, and <b>the</b> <b>cushions</b> produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio contributing to an overall positive reproductive response. However, a study on four populations across a latitudinal gradient in North America showed that southern populations of moss campion had lower survival and recruitment, but higher individual growth rates than more northern populations. Furthermore, vital rates such as growth, survival, and fruits per area were shown to increase in moderately warmer years yet declined in the very warmest years, suggesting that a change in climate into warmer conditions or more frequent unusually warm summers may eventually lead to negative impacts. Another study showed that while the short term responses were positive, they turned negative on medium-term, suggestion that moss campion may be at risk in future global warming.|$|E

2500|$|Moss campion is a low, ground-hugging plant. It {{may seem}} densely matted and moss-like. The dense {{cushions}} {{are up to}} a foot or more in diameter.

[...] It usually has pink flowers, though very rarely they may be white. The flowers are solitary and star-shaped.

2500|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of the Ottawa Nationals of the World Hockey Association (WHA), the team had discussions with Ballard about {{locating}} the team in Toronto, but the talks did not get very far. [...] The team was a flop at the box office, averaging about 3,000 fans a game, and in March 1973—just {{before the end of the}} season—the City of Ottawa demanded payment of $100,000 to guarantee the club dates at the Ottawa Civic Centre. The team decided to leave Ottawa and played their home playoff games at Maple Leaf Gardens, attracting crowds of 5,000 and 4,000 in two games before being eliminated by the New England Whalers. At the end of the season, the team moved to Toronto permanently, and was sold to John F. Bassett, son of former Leafs owner John Bassett. [...] They were renamed the Toronto Toros in June 1973. [...] Bassett wanted the team to play at a renovated CNE Coliseum, while Bill Ballard—Harold's son, who was running the Gardens while his father served a prison sentence—wanted the team at the Gardens and opposed the plan to upgrade the Coliseum. The Toros ended up at Varsity Arena for the 1973–74 season. [...] The following season, the Toros moved to the Gardens after negotiating a lease with Bill. However, by the time the team played their first game at the Gardens, Harold had been released from prison and regained control of the company. Ballard was a virulent opponent of the WHA; he never forgave the upstart league for decimating the Leafs' roster in the early 1970s. He made the Toros' lease terms at the Gardens as onerous as possible. The Toros' lease called for them to pay $15,000 per game. However, much to Bassett's outrage, the arena was dim for their first game. [...] It was then that Ballard demanded $3,500 for use of the lights. Ballard also denied the Toros access to the Leafs' locker room, forcing them to build their own at a cost of $55,000. He also removed <b>the</b> <b>cushions</b> from the home bench for Toros' games. [...] Following two seasons of declining attendance and onerous lease terms at the Gardens, Bassett moved the club to Birmingham, Alabama, where they were renamed the Birmingham Bulls for the 1976–77 season.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} seated buttock {{pressure}} distribution in six paraplegic patients {{by means of}} computerized pressure mapping. They were all male and their age ranged from 18 to 48 years old. Their level of paralysis varied from Th 5 to L 1. Five kinds of wheelchair cushions were studied: an air cushion, a contour cushion, a polyurethane foam cushion, a Cubicushion (which is made of polyurethane foams) and a silicone gel cushion. A tactile sensor consisting of 2064 matrices was used for measuring the buttock pressure distribution and the data was analyzed on a personal computer. Peak pressures measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : the Cubicushion, <b>the</b> polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> contour <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> silicone gel <b>cushion,</b> and <b>the</b> air <b>cushion.</b> <b>The</b> areas of total contact measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : <b>the</b> air <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> silicone gel <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> contour <b>cushion</b> and <b>the</b> Cubicushion.

50|$|The {{amount of}} shock {{transmitted}} {{by a particular}} cushioning material is largely dependent on the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>cushion,</b> <b>the</b> drop height, and the load-bearing area of <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> (static loading).

If the load-bearing area is too small, the product may “bottom out” during a shock; the shock is not cushioned. Engineers use “cushion curves” to choose the best thickness and load-bearing area for a cushioning material. Often two to three inches (50 - 75 mm) of cushioning are needed to protect fragile items.|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} seat {{cushions}} {{have been investigated}} {{for their ability to}} reduce seating discomfort. The objective of this thesis is to examine air-inflated seat cushions to determine how seating comfort (determined by pressure change rate) is affected by changing various parameters of <b>the</b> <b>cushion.</b> To this end, a mathematical model was built using MatLab and SimuLINK to accurately represent <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> and its response. Different aspects of <b>the</b> <b>cushion,</b> such as seating area, outlet size, cell height, and material elasticity are varied to determine how they each affect seating comfort. For each parameter three different weights are tested to see how the trends observed per parameter are affected by a person’s weight. The results {{of this study indicate that}} by changing the base radius, the cell height, the outlet diameter, and the material elasticity of each cell, it is possible to improve seating comfort, as determined by pressure change rate. The study confirms that comfort levels increase with increasing seated area.

40|$|Abstract. To {{evaluate}} quantitatively <b>the</b> {{performance of}} <b>cushioning</b> materials, a cushion curve is indispensable. However, <b>the</b> desired <b>cushioning</b> effect may sometimes be absent when we use <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> curve {{to design a}} transport package. In addition, to plot <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> curve, massive dynamic compression tests are traditionally necessary. Thus, large amounts of labor and material resources are required. Therefore, we used expanded polyethylene and laminated-board cushion as test materials to represent typical cushioning materials, and proposed simplified performance evaluation methods based on certain dynamic compression tests. An analysis of the experimental results showed that to obtain a more accurate packaging design, the shearing effect {{must be taken into}} account when using <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> curve; For both plastic and paper cushions, new proposed performance evaluation methods significantly reduce the number of dynamic compression tests needed to accurately evaluate an actual packaging design...|$|R
