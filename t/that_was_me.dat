500|$|End of the Century was {{described}} by the band as an album written solely to gain popularity, resulting in more of a pop punk sound. Joey failed {{to contribute to the}} best of his abilities on the album and recalled: [...] "I think that some of the worst crap I ever wrote went on the album. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> at my worst." [...] Johnny also felt that the album was far from the band's prime.|$|E
500|$|In a 2016 video {{documentary}} by Noclip's Danny O'Dwyer, Creative Director of Doom (2016) Hugo Martin {{described the}} [...] "Hell on Earth" [...] premise as: [...] "It was like Robert Zemeckis. See Contact, like, if this really happened. Now let's be clear: it was awesome. But {{it was more}} realistic. It was about the global impact of a Hellish invasion." [...] The creative director of the Doom 4 prototype, Kevin Cloud, said in the same interview, [...] "As far as the upper-level creative direction, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> driving that. And honestly, again, taking it in a direction I don't think the fans would have enjoyed." ...|$|E

500|$|Joe Leydon from Variety {{found the}} film's plot {{predictable}} and slow-paced, but noted [...] "the trip itself is never less than pleasant, and often extremely funny". The New York Times Stephen Holden described Chef as [...] "aggressively feel-good" [...] and [...] "shallow but enjoyable". Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars {{and found it}} [...] "deeply satisfying, down to the soul", praising the [...] "incredible" [...] food photography, the [...] "colorful supporting cast" [...] and the [...] "wryly observant" [...] humor, raving, [...] "There's nothing terribly profound about [...] "Chef". But its messagethat relationships, like cooking, take a hands-on approachis a sweet and sustaining one." [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle opined that Chef was Favreau's best film to date, highlighting the [...] "natural and convincing" [...] chemistry between Favreau and Anthony and the [...] "vivid" [...] scenes featuring big-name actors in small roles. USA Today Scott Bowles gave Chef 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it [...] "a nuanced side dish, a slow-cooked film that's {{one of the most}} heartwarming of the young year". Ken Choy of Wide Lantern noted the structural problems but admitted, [...] "If you ever saw the Kristen Bell sloth video on Ellen, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> during the entire 2nd half of the movie. Non-stop tears. It was happy-crying because Favreau's character was doing what he wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Narrator: Intrusive and {{recurring}} {{as a minor}} character, {{the narrator}} seems anonymous while also clearly identifying himself when he, the narrator, says: [...] "That was I. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>me.</b> That {{was the author of}} this book." [...] As noted above, as a soldier, Vonnegut was captured by Germans at the Battle of the Bulge and transported to Dresden. He and fellow prisoners survived the bombing while being held in a deep cellar of Schlachthof Fünf (Slaughterhouse 5). The narrator begins the story describing his connection to the fire-bombing of Dresden and his reasons for writing Slaughterhouse-Five.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{sentence}} says: [...] "All this happened, more or less." [...] (In 2010 this was ranked No. 38 on the American Book Reviews list of [...] "100 Best First Lines from Novels.") The opening sentences {{of the novel}} have been said to contain the aesthetic [...] "method statement" [...] of the entire novel. The author later appears as a sick fellow prisoner in Billy Pilgrim's World War II. The Narrator notes this saying: [...] "That was I. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>me.</b> That {{was the author of}} this book." [...] The story repeatedly refers to real and fictional novels and fiction; Billy reads Valley of the Dolls (1966), skims a Tralfamadorian novel, and participates in a radio talk show, part of a literary-expert panel discussing [...] "The Death of the Novel." [...] As in Mother Night, Vonnegut manipulates fiction and reality.|$|E

They were the respectable ones. Well, what did they get by their respectability? I'll tell you. One of them worked in a whitelead factory twelve {{hours a day for}} nine shillings a week until she died of lead poisoning. She only {{expected}} to get her hands a little paralyzed; but she died. The other was always held up to us as a model because she married a Government laborer in the Deptford victualling yard, and kept his room and the three children neat and tidy on eighteen shillings a week--until he took to drink. That was worth being respectable for, wasn't it? ...|$|E
