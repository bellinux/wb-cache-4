5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between Républicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came through the line behind Sans Pareil and <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard {{did not participate in}} this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|While solving cases, Lili {{eventually}} learns from Hiromi's elder sister, , that Hiromi's allergy {{to girls}} resulted from her: ten years ago, he {{waited in the}} rain for Lili to show after he left her a love letter. Lili encounters , a fortuneteller and hypnotist who kidnaps her father. After Hiromi rescues him, Zeus takes Hiromi captive and demands the star ring in exchange. Realizing that Sirius is her missing mother, Lili frees her from Zeus's hypnosis. Lili learns that her mother disappeared to protect her family from Zeus, who hates Sirius, as he believes that she kidnapped his girlfriend and caused her to become comatose. Lili uncovers the truth: his girlfriend feared that he desired the star ring more than her love and asked Sirius to stage a kidnapping and have him decide between her or the star ring. When he hesitated, she was devastated and <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> off the cliff. After learning this, Zeus loses his desire for the star ring and lets Lili, Hiromi, and Lili's mother leave. Lili accepts Hiromi's love for her. In the conclusion, Lili's mother takes over her fortune-telling business, and Lili continues to solve crimes with Hiromi's assistance.|$|E

25|$|Callirrhoe was a Calydonian {{woman who}} scorned Coresus, a priest of Dionysus, who {{threatened}} to afflict {{all the women}} of Calydon with insanity (see Maenad). The priest was ordered to sacrifice Callirhoe but he killed himself instead. Callirhoe <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into a well which was later named after her.|$|E
25|$|The events {{created a}} great sensation, and {{became known as}} Bloody Sunday. Besant was widely blamed – or {{credited}} – for it. She <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into organising legal aid for the jailed workers and support for their families. Bradlaugh finally broke with her because he felt she should have asked his advice before going ahead with the meeting.|$|E
25|$|Korea has a rich {{folklore}} {{tradition with}} deep links to Korean shamanism. For example, the folklore about Simcheong, {{a girl who}} <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into the oceans, {{is derived from the}} Simcheonggut myth. The Simcheonggut myth was originally used to cure eye disease (Simcheong miraculously cured her father's blindness), but during the suppression of Korean Shamanism in the Joseon Dynasty, the myth evolved into a folktale.|$|E

25|$|The hero plundered Oechalia and overthrew {{its walls}} while Iole <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> {{down from the}} high city wall to escape. It {{turned out that the}} garment she was wearing, opened up and acted like a {{parachute}} which ensured her soft and safe descent. Heracles captured and took Iole unwillingly as captive. His wife, Deianira did not like Iole to become Heracles' concubine but she forebore to object and tolerated it temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Such rituals as widow sacrifice/widow burning have, presumably, prehistoric roots. Early 20th-century {{pioneering}} anthropologist James G. Frazer, for example, {{thought that}} the legendary Greek story of Capaneus, whose wife Evadne <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> on his funeral pyre, might be a relic of an earlier custom of live widow-burning. The strangling of widows after their husbands' deaths are attested from as disparate cultures as the Natchez people in present-day US state Louisiana, {{to a number of}} Pacific Islander cultures.|$|E
25|$|World War II was {{declared}} {{while she was}} recovering in Capri, and Fields – still very ill after her cancer surgery, <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into her work and {{signed up for the}} Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) headed by her old film producer, Basil Dean. Fields travelled to France to entertain the troops in the midst of air-raids, performing on the backs of open lorries and in war-torn areas. She was the first artist to play behind enemy lines in Berlin.|$|E

25|$|The dwarf Litr {{was kicked}} by Thor into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, also <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> on the funeral fire to await Ragnarök {{when she would}} be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.|$|E
25|$|Succumbing to Leander's soft words, {{and to his}} {{argument}} that Aphrodite, as goddess of love, would scorn the worship of a virgin, Hero allowed him {{to make love to}} her. This routine lasted through the warm summer. But one stormy winter night, the waves tossed Leander in the sea and the breezes blew out Hero's light, and Leander lost his way, and was drowned. Hero <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> from the tower in grief and died as well. The name Maiden's Tower might also have its origins in this ancient story.|$|E
25|$|Swanson {{made another}} film for RKO in 1941 (Father Takes a Wife), began {{appearing}} in the legitimate theater, and starred in her own television show in 1948. She <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into painting and sculpting, writing a syndicated column, touring in summer stock, engaging in political activism, radio and television work, clothing and accessories design and marketing, and making occasional appearances on the big screen. But {{it was not until}} 1950 when Sunset Boulevard was released (earning her yet another Academy Award nomination) that she achieved mass recognition again.|$|E

25|$|On 19 June 1812, she {{was allowed}} to see her family. In an {{emotional}} meeting, Maria Luisa <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into her mother's arms, kissed her son with frenzy and her father hugged them all in a general embrace. After this, Maria Luisa {{was allowed to}} see her parents and her son once a month but only for twenty minutes and under surveillance. Only the fall of Napoleon opened the gates of her prison. On 14 January 1814, after {{more than four years}} of captivity, she was freed when the troops of Joachim Murat entered Rome.|$|E
25|$|The devoted wife of {{the captain}} of Galle fort, Lourenço Ferreira, used to {{accompany}} him during his routine inspections and was nearby when he was incapacitated. When the rushing Dutch soldiers came on to kill him she <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> over him and pleaded for them to kill her and spare her beloved husband. A Dutch captain, who witnessed this incident, took them under his protection. According to Portuguese sources, once Commodore Coster learnt of this, he withdrew the “no quarter” order and ordered his men to spare those who took refuge in houses and inside churches.|$|E
25|$|Learning {{a lesson}} from the Trưng revolt, the Han and other {{successful}} Chinese dynasties took measures to eliminate {{the power of the}} Vietnamese nobles. The Vietnamese elites were educated in Chinese culture and politics. A Giao Chỉ prefect, Shi Xie, ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord for forty years and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese emperors. Nearly 200 years passed before the Vietnamese attempted another revolt. In 225 another woman, Triệu Thị Trinh, popularly known as Lady Triệu (Bà Triệu), led another revolt which lasted until 248. Once again, the uprising failed and Triệu Thị Trinh <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> into a river.|$|E

Colyer was severely injured in the jaw, nearly choking to death on his own blood. Sarah Loughton ran towards her mother, who had been moving between tables. Carolyn Loughton <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> {{on top of her}} daughter. Bryant shot Carolyn Loughton in the back; her eardrum was ruptured by the muzzle blast from the gun going off beside her ear. She survived her injuries, but learned after she came out of surgery that, despite her efforts, Sarah had been fatally shot in the head.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 656, {{finding the}} gate of Uthman's house {{strongly}} guarded by his supporters, the Egyptian rebels climbed the back wall and crept inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware {{of what was going}} on inside. The rebels entered his room and struck blows at his head. Naila, the wife of Uthman, <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> on his body to protect him and raised her hand to deflect a sword. She had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside. The next blow killed Uthman. Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{struck in}} Thackeray's {{personal}} life as his wife, Isabella, succumbed to depression {{after the birth}} of their third child, in 1840. Finding that he could get no work done at home, he spent more and more time away until September 1840, when he realised how grave his wife's condition was. Struck by guilt, he set out with his wife to Ireland. During the crossing she <b>threw</b> <b>herself</b> from a water-closet into the sea, but she was pulled from the waters. They fled back home after a four-week battle with her mother. From November 1840 to February 1842 Isabella {{was in and out of}} professional care, as her condition waxed and waned.|$|E
