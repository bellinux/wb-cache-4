5|$|In North Chennai area, {{residents}} staged {{protests and}} criticised {{the state government}} for its lack of any rescue response in their locality. In Puducherry, AIADMK legislator A Anbazhagan said {{that the government was}} not providing relief to affected people and had not <b>taken</b> <b>any</b> precautions, contrary to the government's assurances; he added the administration failed to promptly mobilise various essential departments and urged the territorial administration to carefully prepare a report to ensure delivery of relief to those affected. Following numerous complaints regarding the Tamil Nadu state government's lack of relief effort coordination, a public-interest litigation petition was filed in the Madras High Court; on 11 December, Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Puspha Sathyanarayana heard the petition and converted it to suo moto proceedings. The justices directed the state government to report its relief-effort coordination measures to the court by 16 December.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese at Rock Springs {{were aware}} of the {{animosity}} and rising racial tension with white miners, but had not <b>taken</b> <b>any</b> precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any race riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} was to make £1million in a single year. Realising that they would essentially be making their own prize money, most contestants quit the show within two days. One group stayed together for slightly longer: sleeping {{on the floor of}} their cameraman's flat, they attempted to create their own TV show about themselves. Having also given up his flat and job, Russian was also homeless, and was forced to stay with the contestants he had manipulated. After the programme failed, Russian went into hiding, and was unable to be contacted. He was eventually tracked down by one of his victims to an address in Richmond upon Thames, where he was forced to apologise on camera. As he had not <b>taken</b> <b>any</b> money from his victims, a criminal case against Russian was not pursued—a civil case was also not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
