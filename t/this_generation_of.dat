25|$|After its release, the Taurus {{became a}} strong seller, as over 200,000 would {{be sold in}} the 1986 model year, and over a million were sold by 1989. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Taurus {{garnered}} additional sales by its two variants: a Mercury version entitled the Sable, and a high-performance version entitled the SHO, and its engine and drivetrain would be used on the 1988 Lincoln Continental. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Taurus continued with only minor changes until it was replaced in 1992 by the second-generation Ford Taurus. When production ended in 1991, more than 2,000,000 First-generation Tauruses had been sold.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Taurus was {{released}} {{for sale in}} late 1995 to mixed reactions from consumers. It managed to retain its status as the best selling car in America through the 1996 model year; however, this was achieved through heavy sales to car rental companies: only 49% of Taurus sales in 1996 were to private customers. Because of this, the Taurus lost its bestseller status in 1997 to the Toyota Camry. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Taurus continued to be sold until 1999, only around 370,000 {{of them had been}} sold, it was replaced with the fourth-generation Ford Taurus.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the Corolla was {{launched}} in South Africa in September 2007. Unlike in some countries, Corolla mainly refers to the sedan and not the hatchback, which in South Africa {{is known as the}} Toyota Auris. This generation is lower and wider than its predecessor. Toyota South Africa achieved a new all-time sales record for the South African motor industry in October 2007 with the Corolla (including Auris) leading the vehicle sales chart.|$|E

25|$|This {{model of}} SHO gained a {{reputation}} of being trouble-prone due to {{a large number of}} engine failures at around the 50,000-mile mark due to separation of the camshaft from its sprocket. However, this problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded. Possibly because of this, <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> SHO sold substantially worse than its predecessor, with sales peaking at 9,000 in 1997. As a result, the SHO was discontinued outright after the 1999 model year.|$|E
25|$|Stig: His {{nickname}} {{may come}} from the term stigma, as he is marked an outsider for his notable lack of hygiene. Stig is the last member to be initiated into <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the Midnight Society. As such, he has only two stories in the series before the cast is changed. Due to the aversion people seem to have against him for his looks, both his stories seem to revolve around outsiders judged for their appearances and tastes.|$|E

Although not very fast, the sturdy Datsun was well-suited to the rugged Finnish roads of the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} Romanesque in Portugal {{followed}} the North-South {{path of the}} Reconquista, specially {{during the reign of}} Afonso Henriques, Count Henry's son and first King of Portugal. In Coimbra, Afonso Henriques created the Santa Cruz Monastery, {{one of the most important}} of the monastic foundations of the time, although the current building is the result of a 16th-century remodelling. Afonso Henriques and his successors also sponsored the building of many cathedrals in the bishop seats of the country. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Romanesque cathedrals included the already-mentioned Braga, Oporto, Coimbra, Viseu, Lamego and Lisbon.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} geology was of great {{interest}} during the colonial period. Rich coal bearing seams, gold and other minerals became much sought after resources. This {{led to the formation}} of the Geological Survey of India, the first superintendent of which was Thomas Oldham (1816–1878). With his interest in fossils, especially after his discovery of Oldhamia, he took considerable interest in the palaeontological aspects of India. He recruited Ferdinand Stoliczka to work on the Jurassic beds of Kutch. The work of <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> geologists led to globally significant discoveries including support for continental drift and the idea of a Gondwana supercontinent.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 2008, Land Transport Authority {{announced}} a two-month {{trial of the}} new generation Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) card that was developed in-house.

The card has replaced <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> EZ-Link cards in 2009 and aims to encourage competition by allowing up to four CEPAS card issuers. Mass replacement of the old Sony FeliCa cards to the new CEPAS cards went on at TransitLink Ticket offices and Singapore Post outlets till 7 October 2009.|$|E

25|$|Immediately on our {{coming up}} out of the water after we had been baptized, we {{experienced}} great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E
25|$|The TRAXX carbody {{design and}} {{internal}} configuration was modified again in 2006 {{when the first}} actual Diesel-electric version was built, to provide the same layout for Diesel and electric versions. In the electric versions, the central location of the diesel engine {{was used for the}} AC transformer or the DC chokes. The weight of the component at the central location is supported on a horizontal mounting plate that fits onto the main frame using the same fixtures. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the family is also referred to as the TRAXX2E platform, the type designations themselves didn't change. The TRAXX2E generation also included the first actual deliveries of the DC versions of the TRAXX platform. The AC version of the TRAXX2 remained in production in parallel with the 2E versions of other types.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, {{the basic}} TRAXX design was {{subjected}} to a major overhaul, with the carbody and the front redesigned to suit current crashworthiness standards, and the replacement of GTO thyristor based inverters with IGBT based inverters. The option of individual axle control in place of individual bogie control was also introduced. The coolant of the inverters and the main transformer was also changed from ester to water. The carbody design was completely standardised, by default providing a space for the mounting of a flip-disc display above the windshield, which is covered by a non-structural hood in freight versions. The bogie frame was strengthened, to allow an increase of axle loads to 22 tons. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the family is {{also referred to as}} the TRAXX2 platform, and is sometimes also indicated with a number 2 {{at the end of the}} type designations.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation Zune 16 and 120 {{devices were}} {{released}} in September 2008, {{coinciding with the}} release of the Zune Software 3.0 update. The only changes to <b>this</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> devices were to the firmware, which was made available for all previous models, and the storage capacity. Included in this firmware update was the ability to tag and later purchase songs heard on FM radio, channels which can be customized to deliver suggested songs for the user, the games Hexic and Texas Hold' em, support for audiobooks from online stores such as Audible.com and others that support OverDrive media files, a clock, and changed quicklist functionality. The ability to purchase songs from Zune Marketplace on the device while connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi was also introduced. To help push this feature, Microsoft partnered with Wayport to allow Zune devices to access its network of over 10,000 wireless hotspots, including those at McDonald's restaurants.|$|E
25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{the sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for 2000. Like with previous generations, the Sable shared all mechanical components with the Taurus with a unique body. The new Sable was also largely carried over from the previous model, with changes limited a new front fascia, rear fascia, wheels, a taller roof and trunk, and a new interior, though the interior was the same design of the Taurus with added woodgrain trim. Like with previous generations, the Sable offered the same powertrains and equipment as the Taurus. The Sable was again offered in GS and LS models in wagon and sedan body styles, with a new top-of-the-line LS Premium trim. An LS Platinum edition was also briefly offered. The Sable was updated in 2004 with a new grille, front bumper, steering wheel, instrument cluster, wheels and taillamps. The Sable was discontinued in 2005 and replaced by the Mercury Montego (which would be renamed as the Sable in 2008) and Mercury Milan. <b>This</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Sable was not sold in Canada, as the Mercury nameplate had been discontinued there by the 2000 model year.|$|E
