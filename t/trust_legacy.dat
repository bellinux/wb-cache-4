40|$|One {{of the key}} {{motivations for}} the Semantic Web {{technology}} is the better support of self-organizing knowledge exchange between users. A human being browse the Web? That should become a little old fashioned. Personal work environments {{should be able to}} browse the Web automatically and find what the user is looking for- based on what they know about our individual needs and the descriptive knowledge they find on relevant remote sites. It {{is not surprising that the}} aspects of tracking, representation, and utilization of provenance knowledge came more and more into the focus of the Semantic Web domain. Many state-of-the-art environments for sharing and collaboration aim to utilize provenance knowledge for <b>trust,</b> <b>legacy,</b> ranking, visualization, and many other applications. Nowadays, an important challenge is to close the pending gap between particular system-level solutions and foundational theoretical results. The integration of knowledge from heteroge-neous information sources and applications does not only require the conceptual mapping of information structures, but it also requires the treatment of provenance in a generic manner. Conceptually, these information essentially contribute to the proof layer of the Semantic Web layer cake (Figure 1). The basic intention of the proof layer is to provide explanations about the answers given by automated agents that consume the provided information. In other words, the proof layer is basically a layer of provenance. 2 Our Objectives In our contribution, we raise the following question: what is the provenance-based proof layer in the Semantic Web?
