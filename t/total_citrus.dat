50|$|After {{becoming}} a Category 2 hurricane on October 7, the cyclone weakened to a Category 1 just six hours later. Around 04:00 UTC {{on the following}} day, it made another landfall near Bradenton Beach, Florida, with winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). In Florida, the gusty winds and rainfall produced by the storm inflicted damage mostly on crops. About 2% of the state's <b>total</b> <b>citrus</b> crop was lost, with damage totaling $5 million. Only about $200,000 in property damage occurred, which was mostly due to coastal flooding {{in cities such as}} Everglades, Fort Myers, and Punta Gorda. Moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm later on October 8. Early on October 9, the system became extratropical over South Carolina. However, the extratropical remnants persisted for several days, moving in a semicircular path over the eastern Atlantic until dissipating well north of Hispaniola on October 14.|$|E

In 2004-2005 USDA Ag statistics reported the <b>total</b> Florida <b>citrus</b> production to be 169.1 million boxes of fruit. The estimate for all Florida citrus production in the 2015-2016 season is 86.4 million boxes—a 51% drop. In June 2008, the psyllid was spotted dangerously close to California - right across the international border in Tijuana, Mexico. Only a few months later, it was detected in San Diego and Imperial counties, and has since spread to Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties sparking quarantines in those areas. The Asian citrus psyllid has also been intercepted coming into California in packages of fruit and plants, including citrus, ornamentals, herbs and bouquets of cut flowers, shipped from other states and countries.|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} to explain Florida citrus planting levels by variety. The varietal choice {{is based on}} the expected prices and price variances/covariances of the varieties under consideration. Overall planting returns are maximized for a given level of price risk. The model's price coefficients {{are similar to those of}} the Theil and Barten Rotterdam demand model. As in the Rotterdam model, both absolute and relative price coefficient specifications are considered, allowing an examination of restrictions related to the price risk. The empirical analysis considers two restricted specifications [...] a varietal independence model, based on the assumption that only the price variances are important for predicting planting levels, and a group independence model that additionally assumes the price covariance for two varieties from the same (different) group(s) is nonzero (zero). Both models substantially reduce the parameter space and may be of interest in situations where lack of degrees of freedom is an issue. A varying parameter model was also estimated, indicating that with growth in the world orange-juice market, orange prices have been perceived to be less unstable, and orange planting responses to changes in <b>total</b> <b>citrus</b> acreage planted and orange prices have been stronger. planting decision, Florida citrus, price risk, expected returns, Demand and Price Analysis, Farm Management,...|$|E

40|$|Citriculture is an {{important}} segment of world food production and nutrition. Oranges account for 67 % of <b>total</b> worldwide <b>citrus</b> production. Oranges are consumed, principally {{in the form of}} juice, {{at an annual rate of}} approximately 17 kilograms per person (The Almanac of the Canning, 1979). A major problem in the citrus industry worldwide is the formation of bitterness in citrus juice and products within hours after extraction from the fruit. The problem occurs in certain varieties of oranges (including mandarins), grapefruits, and lemons. The problem is estimated to cause losses for California citriculture of $ 6 million to $ 8 million per year (anon., 1986 a). The primary cause of the “delayed bitterness ” in oranges is the presence of an intensely bitter group of compounds called limonoids, principally limonin and nomilin (Figure 1). The extent of bitterness imparted by limonin has been studied by Levi and coworkers (Levi et al., 1974), who obtained the values shown in Table I.

40|$|Over 30 % of the <b>total</b> <b>citrus</b> fruits grown {{all over}} the World are processed, {{generating}} large quantities of peel waste from which essential citrus oils are often extracted by traditional methods demanding high energy costs, long extraction times and additional reagents. In this research an alternative technique based on microwave-assisted hydro-distillation (MAHD) has been studied to successfully extract the essential oil present in wet citrus peel waste whilst reducing costs, avoiding the use of additives and improving {{the effectiveness of the}} process. To achieve this goal factors affecting the scalability of the process to develop a new bio-refinery model to be used at industrial scale were considered. Optimal conditions for the essential oil MAHD involved the irradiation of a waste orange peel:water mixture (1 : 1. 5) over two subsequent steps using different irradiation powers for a total extraction time of 20 min (keeping a constant pressure of 300 mbar through all the process). The essential oil yield obtained in Navel Navelate oranges using MAHD accounted for 1. 8 ± 0. 1 % (dry basis; n = 3) and was comparable to that obtained by conventional hydro-distillation (1. 7 ± 0. 1 %; dry basis; n = 3). The applicability of the suggested methodology was successfully tested in other varieties of orange and citrus fruits leading to the potential to apply MAHD of essential oils from other waste feedstocks and offering an attractive process for future extraction processes at industrial scale...|$|E

To satisfy the demand of worldwide markets from POS and avoid the shortcomings of currently applied methodologies encountered in their preparation, the present study highlights a novel robust approach for POS biosynthesis. In the current approach, Aspergillus sp. section Flavi strain EGY 1 DSM 101520 was grown on citrus pectin-based medium as a core POS production medium. POS' levels accumulated in the fungal fermentation broth were optimized through a three step sequential statistical mathematical methodology; Plackett-Burman design (PBD), Box-Behnken design (BBD) and canonical analysis. Three key determinants namely citrus pectin, peptone and NaH 2 PO 4 were pointed out by PBD to impose significant consequences (P< 0. 05) on the process outcome (POS' levels). Optimal levels of these key determinants along with maximal of POS' levels were set by BBD and canonical analysis to be 2. 28 % (w/v) citrus pectin, 0. 026 % (w/v) peptone and 0. 28 % (w/v) NaH 2 PO 4 to achieve a net amount of 1. 3 g POS / 2. 28 g citrus pectin. Through this approach, a yield of 57 % (w/w) POS of the <b>total</b> <b>citrus</b> pectin was obtained after 24 h of fungal growth on optimized citrus pectin-based medium. A fold enhancement of 13 times in POS' levels released in the fermentation fungal broth was realized {{by the end of}} the optimization strategy.

Mandarin cultivation represents 5. 5 % of <b>total</b> <b>citrus</b> production in the country. In 2001, three experiments were planted in the Citrus Experimental Station (EECB), Bebedouro, Northern São Paulo State, where the first HLB symptomatic tree was detected in 2006. The initial objective was to evaluate the performance of ‘Folha Murcha’ sweet orange, ‘Tahiti’ acid lime and ‘Okitsu’ mandarin grafted on twelve rootstocks including Rangpur lime, Swingle citrumelo, Rubidoux and Flying Dragon (FD) trifoliate oranges. Cumulative HLB incidence (CI) was calculated in 2009. Folha Murcha and Tahiti lime trees on FD had lower CI values (6. 7 and 10 %) than trees on Rangpur lime (33. 3 and 80 %), Swingle citrumelo (46. 7 and 66. 7 %) and Rubidoux (46. 7 and 60 %).

50|$|Huanglongbing (HLB), called citrus {{greening}} {{within the}} industry, {{is recognized as}} the deadliest citrus disease the Florida citrus industry has ever faced. This {{can be attributed to}} the economic costs of implementing new care-taking strategies, and overall tree loss creating a loss of revenues. A look at <b>total</b> Florida <b>citrus</b> growing acreage provides a tangible impression to the hardships citrus greening provides; in 2000 there was 665,529 commercially producing citrus acres, while in 2011 there were 473,086 commercially producing citrus acres in Florida. Every year citrus reports indicate a continued loss of citrus production. Citrus greening is being attributed for a total output impact of -4.51 billion, and a loss of 8,257 jobs within the state of Florida. The disease has now spread throughout the entire state, and affects every Florida citrus grower. The disease is spread through an insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid. The psyllid was previously introduced into Florida in 1998. At this time citrus greening was never found within the state, thus the psyllids spread was left unchecked. By the time citrus greening had reached Florida psyllid populations were well established throughout the state of Florida. The first positive case of greening disease was in August 2005, when a greening positive citrus tree was discovered in Miami-Dade County. It was at this time the entire Florida citrus industry changed its citriculture practices overnight. Intensive pesticide applications, aggressive removal of citrus greening positive trees, and the complete switch from outdoor to indoor citrus nursery operations transpired.|$|R

Analyses were based on 282 incident stomach cancer cases after 6. 3 years of follow-up. Age- and sex-adjusted rate ratios of stomach cancer in increasing quintiles of combined vegetable and fruit consumption were 1. 00, 0. 70, 0. 65, 0. 76, and 0. 64 (p trend = 0. 04). Multivariate analysis resulted in rate ratios that were somewhat closer to one (p trend = 0. 14). Furthermore, inverse associations for total vegetables, pulses, raw leafy vegetables, <b>total</b> fruit, <b>citrus</b> fruit, and apples and pears that were observed in crude analyses became weaker or disappeared in multivariate analyses. Total vegetable, but not fruit, consumption was significantly lower in cases diagnosed in the first follow-up year. In analyses limited to first year cases (resembling a case-control study), rate ratios for increasing tertiles of total vegetable consumption were 1. 00, 0. 17, and 0. 18 (p trend = 0. 0001), which may indicate the presence of information bias in case-control studies.

30|$|Generally, {{about 60}} – 80 % of {{expenses}} in poultry production {{is related to}} feeding (Chaudry et al. 2004). As such, replacing traditional feed ingredients with waste by-products {{may contribute to the}} development of the cost efficiency in poultry diets. Besides, agro-industrial waste is a matter of great concern and a big problem for fruit- and vegetable-based industries. The wastes left after processing, are, however, rich in some essential nutrients that have the potency to be supplemented in animal diets as by-products. Incorporation of fruits and vegetable wastes in animal feeds may improve palatability of diet and consequently increase the feed consumption in addition to decrease the cost of the feed (Chaudry et al. 2004). Iran is producing about 3.5 % of the world <b>total</b> <b>citrus</b> production and subsequently has been encountered with enormous citrus wastes. The major by-products of citrus family include dry pulp, molasses, washed pulp solids, and essential oils. Citrus pulp contains active antioxidants encompass of flavonoids, isoflavones, flavones, anthocyanins, coumarins, lignans, catechins, and isocatechins (Nobakht 2013). Flavonoids may decrease the blood cholesterol and quench free radicals (Hougee et al. 2005). Dietary replacement of the feed corn by sweet orange up to 15 % has been previously reported (Oluremi et al. 2006). Agu et al. (2010) substituted dietary maize by sweet orange up to 20 % with no deleterious impact on the performance and carcass characteristics in broiler chickens. The nutrient digestibility improved, when the yellow corn was replaced up to 20 and 40 % with the lemon pulp and with 20 and 60 % orange pulp in rabbit diets (Ibrahim et al. 2011). Furthermore, Nobakht (2013) indicated that dried lemon pulp (DLP) improved growth performance of chickens across the entire production period. Moreover, citrus pulp was indicated to expand the gastrointestinal tract in broiler chickens (Mourão et al. 2008). Nevertheless, effects of dried lemon pulp (DLP; citrus aurantifulia) on the morphology of small intestine and humoral immunity in broilers are less investigated. Thus, the objective of current trial was to evaluate the effect of dietary graded levels of DLP on growth performance, intestinal morphology, and humoral immunity in broiler chickens.|$|E
40|$|In 1968 and 1969, {{moisture}} level treatments {{were applied to}} tomatoes and citrus. Light sprinkler applications and white acrylic paint were applied to leaf canopies of tomatoes and citrus. Moisture use and yields as influenced by treatments were determined. Microclimatic data as influenced by treatments were determined. Estimates of influences of treatments on transpiration were evaluated with thermoelectric sensors. Tomato and citrus plant parts were analyzed for certain chemical properties. Diurnal changes in citrus tree trunks and fruits were monitored with linear variable displacement transducers. Moisture Use and Yield The effects of treatments on tomatoes were influenced by years. In 1968, the effects of treatments on water use were small and inconclusive. The white reflective treatment reduced water use by tomatoes by 10 %, but reduced yields by 30 % in 1969. Evaporative cooling increased yields of tomatoes in 1968 and 1969. Water use by citrus was significantly increased by sprinkler treatment in 1968, but not in 1969. In 1968, evaporative cooling increased <b>total</b> <b>citrus</b> yields and increased the tonnage of fruits which could be sold to fresh market. Evaporative cooling was effective in influencing fruit quality and size, and offers the promises of increasing the yield of quality produce and of making more efficient use of our diminishing water supply. Microclimatic Data Canopy, leaf and soil temperatures, humidity, and net radiation data for tomatoes and citrus indicated that evaporative cooling and reflective treatment modified plant stress conditions in canopies of tomatoes and citrus. However, the differences due to treatments on tomatoes were small in 1968, and the differences on citrus were small in 1968 and 1969. Climatic conditions in canopy and net radiation data indicated that reflective treatment on tomatoes was effective in reflecting the incoming solar radiation in 1969. Thermoelectric Data Sap flow as influenced by treatments and climatic conditions was evaluated with a thermoelectric method. Sap flow was highest by tomatoes grown on the sprinkler treatment, and least by tomatoes grown on the dry treatment. Moisture contents of tomato stems were influenced by time and treatments. Sap flow in citrus as influenced by treatments and time was illdefined, possibly due to open structure of citrus. One-of the greatest problems {{with the use of}} the thermoelectric method for evaluating sap flow for tomatoes and citrus in the field was plant variability. Chemical Analyses Evaporative cooling and reflective treatments increased the Ca content and lowered the K:Ca ratio of tomato fruits. Previous research has shown that these chemical properties are associated with lower plant water stress. The lower Ca content of citrus leaves and lower Brix? and acid content of grapefruits indicate that citrus treated with sprinkler applications was under lower plant-water stress than citrus on the control treatment. Sprinkler applications increased the C 1 concentration of leaves causing moderate to severe defoliation in 1968 and 1969. Defoliation may have confounded the potential results or trends. Plant-Water Stress Diurnal changes in citrus tree trunks and fruits were effectively monitored by linear variable displacement transducers (LVDT). These data suggest that the diurnal changes in tree trunks and fruits were indices of plant-water stress. Sprinkler treatment reduced daily fruit shrinkage and enhanced fruit enlargement in 1969...|$|E
40|$|The Israeli citrus export {{sector was}} liberalized in 1991 {{with the aim}} to {{increase}} citrus growers income and to improve overall efficiency of the international citrus marketing channel. However, the former government export monopolys activities were mainly taken over by four large companies accounting for over 90 % of <b>total</b> Israeli <b>citrus</b> market exports. In addition, citrus exporters maintained the monopolys consignment system, substantially limiting transparency on how the grower price is determined. This lead the government {{to intervene in the}} newly liberalized market by implementing a minimum price agreement in the 1994 / 95 season to protect citrus growers against exporters abuse of market power. In this paper we analyze whether market power was exerted by exporting companies over citrus growers in the form of asymmetric price transmission. Our study is unique in that it investigates vertical price transmission across international borders, i. e. in the context of Israeli grapefruit exports to France. We explicitly account for possible changes in exporters pricing behaviour in the post-liberalization period. We apply an error correction model (ECM) to disaggregated firm-level Israeli grower price and French import price data. An ECM is estimated individually for each of the major exporting companies within a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework. We find asymmetric price transmission in the first years after liberalisation, but symmetry {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. Our results indicate that growers losses due to asymmetry amounted to as much as 2. 5 % of their total revenues. Our results suggest that liberalization improved the efficiency of the Israeli citrus international marketing channel, but that this took time and was probably accelerated by government intervention.

30|$|This study {{provides}} information on the biology of the gall midge Prodiplosis longifila, {{one of the most}} destructive pests of tomato and paprika in Colombia. P. longifila is reported for the first time attacking reproductive structures of Tahiti lime in Colombia. Microscopic preparations of P. longifila males are needed for taxonomic identification; the antennae have 14 flagellomeres with two nodes each, and the male gonopods are oriented dorsoventrally. The insect is distributed between Andean valleys located at 739 up to 2168 masl in The Andes of Colombia. Apparently, unchecked transport of plant material has contributed to the dispersion of the species, so sanitation measures should be implemented in nurseries. Pruning tomato leaves may reduce the population of P. longifila larvae. Besides altitude, the variables that most influence the distribution of P. longifila are temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. The infestation of P. longifila in tomato decreases during periods of high rainfall, possibly because larvae drop from the foliage to the ground, but also because the high concentration of moisture and lack of oxygen in the soil may increase pupal mortality. Prediction models based on tomato crop populations predict the distribution of the species on the foothills of Meta area, located on the eastern slope of the Andes, where 10 % of <b>total</b> Colombian <b>citrus</b> cultivation takes place. Some years ago P. longifila caused economic losses to Tahiti lime production in the USA, therefore it is important to further investigate its impact on Tahiti lime production in Colombia. However DNA analysis for P. longifila is required to understand if the populations of P. longifila collected from different host plants correspond to a complex of cryptic species rather than a single polyphagous species. These results will be fundamental to develop effective IPM strategies, including biological control programmes.|$|R

In multivariate case-cohort analyses, the following rate ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for vegetable consumption were found (comparing highest versus lowest quintile) : total vegetables (RR, 0. 80; CI, 0. 57 - 1. 12); prepared vegetables (RR, 0. 85; CI, 0. 61 - 1. 19); and raw vegetables (RR, 0. 96; CI, 0. 69 - 1. 34). For vegetables categorized in botanical groups, no associations were found except for consumption of pulses (RR, 0. 71; CI, 0. 51 - 0. 98; P for trend, 0. 01). The RRs for <b>total</b> fruit and <b>citrus</b> fruit were 1. 31 (CI, 0. 96 - 1. 79) and 1. 27 (CI, 0. 93 - 1. 73), respectively; the corresponding Ps for trend were 0. 02 and 0. 01, respectively. In a continuous model, no association for total fruit was observed. Individual vegetables and fruits were evaluated as continuous variables (g/day). Nonsignificant inverse associations (RRs per increment of 25 g/day) were found for consumption of kale (RR, 0. 74), raw endive (RR, 0. 72), mandarins (RR, 0. 75), and raisins or other dried fruit (RR, 0. 49). Observed positive associations were significant for consumption of leek (RR, 1. 38) and oranges (RR, 1. 07) and nonsignificant for sweet peppers (RR, 1. 60) and mushrooms (RR, 1. 49). Results in subgroups of cases {{were more or less}} consistent with the overall results. From our study, we cannot conclude that vegetable consumption is important in prostate cancer etiology, but for certain vegetables or fruits, an association cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Higher total {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} intake (FV) {{is associated with a}} lower CVD risk, however, the relative importance of particular fruits or vegetables (subgroups) is unknown. The association between coffee, tea intakes, and CVD risk is also inconsistent. FV, coffee, and tea are (poly) phenol-rich foods commonly consumed in the UK. This thesis studied the association between these food groups, their respective subgroups and CVD mortality, incidence, and blood pressure (BP) in the UK Women’s Cohort Study (UKWCS) and the National Diet and Nutritional Survey Rolling Programme (NDNS RP). Survival analysis was applied to calculate the risk of CVD mortality, and CVD incidence with increasing FV, coffee and tea intake in the UKWCS. The odds of being hypertensive were assessed using logistic regression in the UKWCS (self-reported) and the NDNS RP (measured). Measured BP levels were also investigated in the NDNS RP using multivariate regression. Aspects of methodology were explored between dietary assessments in the UKWCS using the Kappa statistic. Overall, CVD risk was lower with higher intakes of FV, especially for <b>total</b> fruit, berries, <b>citrus</b> and grapes, but not for total vegetable. Greater intakes of total vegetables, fruit vegetables, and pomes were associated with a lower incidence of self-reported BP. Systolic BP was lower with increasing FV intake while diastolic BP lowered with a greater pome consumption. Attenuated associations in subpopulations with CVD risk factors suggest that protective effects are more apparent in healthy subpopulations. Coffee and tea intakes were not associated with the risk of CVD in either UK populations. The FFQ in the UKWCS was able to rank the participants by low and high intakes, providing evidence for significant and null associations detected above. Novel findings from the total phenolic content within fruit juices and concentrates from the UK highlights the importance of updating Phenol Explorer, to accurately estimate (poly) phenol intake in the future. Implementation of RCTs based on hypotheses generated here would aid the determination of causal links between FV subgroups such as berries, citrus, pomes, grapes, and fruit vegetables and CVD risk. ...|$|R
