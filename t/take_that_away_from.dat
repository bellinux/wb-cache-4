500|$|... "They Can't <b>Take</b> <b>That</b> <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> Me" [...] is a {{song from}} the musical film Shall We Dance, {{composed}} by George Gershwin with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. It was introduced by Fred Astaire, whose recording with the Johnny Green Orchestra stayed at number one for ten weeks.

500|$|... "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo {{song that}} blends pop and R beats. Additionally, it {{incorporates}} its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. The ballad {{is set in the}} signature of common time, with a slowly tempo of 52 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major, with Carey's vocals spanning almost three octaves, from the low note of A2 to the high note of F#5. Although the song was written by Carey and Diane Warren, the latter does not usually share songwriting credit. Although there were no conflicts during the recording process, the pair had minor disagreements during the songwriting stages: Carey said that Warren liked to repeat lyrical phrases often. The second song that Carey and Warren wrote together was [...] "There for Me" [...] which was released as a B-side to the [...] "Never Too Far/Hero Medley" [...] charity single Carey recorded in late 2001. The song's protagonist details the struggles of dealing with people who put you down, and how to overcome these struggles through faith, courage, and the power of God. Carey explains in the song's lyrics how although people can try to make her feel down and depressed, no matter what happens, she can't let them win: [...] "There's a light in me that shines brightly. They can try but they can't <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me." ...|$|E

Sinatra's first album for Capitol, Songs for Young Lovers, {{was released on}} January 4, 1954, and included [...] "A Foggy Day", [...] "I Get a Kick Out of You", [...] "My Funny Valentine", [...] "Violets for Your Furs" [...] and [...] "They Can't <b>Take</b> <b>That</b> <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> Me", songs which became staples of his later concerts. That same month, Sinatra and Doris Day released the single [...] "Young at Heart", which reached #2 and was awarded Song of the Year. In March, he recorded and released the single [...] "Three Coins in the Fountain", a [...] "powerful ballad" [...] that reached #4.

Swing Easy! was named Album of the Year by Billboard, {{and he was also}} named [...] "Favorite Male Vocalist" [...] by Billboard, Down Beat, and Metronome that year. Sinatra came to consider Riddle [...] "the greatest arranger in the world", and Riddle, who considered Sinatra [...] "a perfectionist", offered equal praise of the singer, observing, [...] "It's not only that his intuitions as to tempi, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable... there is still no one who can approach him." ...|$|E
500|$|While Lavigne denied being angry, her {{interviews}} were still {{passionate about the}} media's {{lack of respect for}} her songwriting. She said [...] "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me", adding that she had been writing [...] "full-structured songs" [...] since she was 14. Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles [...] "Complicated", [...] "Sk8er Boi" [...] and [...] "I'm with You". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that [...] "one of those songs aren't from me". In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism and criticized her songwriting, saying that [...] "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything." [...] Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for [...] "clear defamation" [...] against her character. Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that [...] "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her." [...] Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" [...] for her song [...] "Girlfriend". Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, [...] "me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos." [...] In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.|$|E
