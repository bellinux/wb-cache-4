5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the fallout from <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of science of science policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E

Lightweight foam insulation on <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> external tank led to <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> destruction, as a piece broke loose, damaged its wing and caused it to break up on atmospheric reentry.|$|R
