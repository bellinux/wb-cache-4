5|$|During a {{televised}} address to <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>on</b> 7 September 2004, Lukashenko {{announced plans for}} a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, {{the same day as}} parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006. Opposition groups, the OSCE, the European Union, and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of international standards. An example of the failure, cited by the OSCE, was the pre-marking of ballots. Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko, but much of this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below-market prices, refined, and sold to other European countries at a profit.|$|E

As {{concerning}} {{the rest of the}} Beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. And therefore all the four Beasts are still alive, tho the dominion of the three first be taken away. <b>The</b> <b>nations</b> of Chaldea and Assyria are still the first Beast. Those of Media and Persia are still the second Beast. Those of Macedon, Greece and Thrace, Asia minor, Syria and Egypt, are still the third. And those of Europe, on this side Greece, are still the fourth. Seeing therefore the body of the third Beast is confined to <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> this side <b>the</b> river Euphrates, and the body of the fourth Beast is confined to <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> this side Greece; we are to look for all the four heads of the third Beast, among <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> this side of the river Euphrates; and for all the eleven horns of the fourth Beast, among <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>on</b> this side of Greece. And therefore, at the breaking of the Greek empire into four kingdoms of the Greeks, we include no part of the Chaldeans, Medes and Persians in those kingdoms, because they belonged to the bodies of the two first Beasts. Nor do we reckon the Greek empire seated at Constantinople, among the horns of the fourth Beast, because it belonged to the body of the third.|$|R
