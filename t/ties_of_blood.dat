25|$|The Normans were {{in contact}} with England from an early date. Not only were their {{original}} Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.|$|E

The booklet Read This and the War is Won—for the Japanese army—presented colonialism as an oppressive group of colonists living in luxury by burdening Asians. Since racial <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> connected other Asians to the Japanese, and Asians had been weakened by colonialism, it was Japan's self-appointed role to [...] "make men of them again" [...] and liberate them from their western oppressors ...|$|E
2500|$|Brazil's {{reaction}} to the invasion of Goa was one of staunch solidarity with Portugal, reflecting earlier statements by Brazilian presidents that their country stood firmly with Portugal {{anywhere in the world}} and that ties between Brazil and Portugal were built on <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and sentiment. Former Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek, and long time friend and supporter of Portuguese PM Salazar, stated to Indian PM Nehru that [...] "Seventy Million Brazilians could never understand, nor accept, an act of violence against Goa." [...] In a speech in Rio de Janeiro on 10 June 1962, Brazilian congressman Gilberto Freyre commented on the invasion of Goa by declaring that [...] "a Portuguese wound is Brazilian pain".|$|E

2500|$|The most {{distinguished}} [...] "Ammi" [...] is an amora {{of the third}} generation (3rd century). His native country is not named, but it is generally assumed to be Babylonia. It seems probable that the lifelong friendship existing between R. Ammi and R. Assi had its origin in <b>ties</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> R. Assi is identical with R. Assi (Jose) b. Nathan, and R. Ammi's full name, as given by himself, is Ammi ben Nathan (Giṭ. 44a); both of them, moreover, were of priestly descent (Meg. 22a, Ḥul. 107b), so {{that they seem to}} have been the sons of the same father; and as R.

[...] Surely the interests of all Afrikaners throughout the region must be essentially the same? [...] Smuts identified two main factors hindering union; the reluctance of the British population to put down roots, to regard South Africa as home rather than looking back to Britain, and the Afrikaner desire to keep itself apart, relying on its superior numbers to impose its will upon the rest. [...] So far as Smuts could see these two obstacles had been overcome in the Cape, why not in the Transvaal? ...|$|E

Lucky I caught you this generation, before the doctors had saved your appearances. Yet, caro mio, whether it shows or not, there you once had immediate connection with the maternal blood-stream. And, because the male nucleus which derived from the father still lies sparkling and potent within the solar plexus, therefore that great nerve-center of you, still has immediate knowledge of your father, a subtler but still vital connection. We call it the <b>tie</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> So be it. It is a <b>tie</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> But much more definite than we imagine. For true {{it is that the}} one bright male germ which went to your begetting was drawn from the <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> the father. And true it is that that same bright male germ lies unquenched and unquenchable at the center of you, within the famous solar plexus.

This duty of blood-revenge was the supreme {{religion}} of the race. Moreover, the clan was answerable as a whole for the ill-deeds of all its members; and the fine payable for murder or injury was handed over by {{the family of the}} wrong-doer to the family of the injured man.|$|R
