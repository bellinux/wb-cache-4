5|$|During {{one of the}} cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by the Edea in battle. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> {{a theory}} that Squall dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as mad cow disease) caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.|$|E

5|$|Masaccio's use {{of light}} was also revolutionary. While earlier artists like Giotto had applied a flat, neutral light from an unidentifiable source, Masaccio's light emanated from a {{specific}} location outside the picture, casting {{the figures in}} light and shadow. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> a chiaroscuro effect, sculpting the bodies into three-dimensional shapes.|$|E
5|$|The Antiquities Conservation Facility (ACF) {{was set up}} at TARL {{to study}} the {{material}} found by Platoro.

After the ACF was closed these principles were carried forward in the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.|$|E

5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E
5|$|By May, Harrison {{had agreed}} {{distribution}} terms with A Records {{and was therefore}} able to formally launch Dark Horse Records, although he would remain contracted to Apple as a solo artist, like the other Beatles, until January 1976. After announcing the staging of the Music Festival from India in September 1974, Harrison also confirmed {{that he planned to}} tour North America, together with Ravi Shankar's ensemble, during November and December. Despite his stated aversion to performing live, Harrison would be the first of his former bandmates to undertake a tour of Beatle-hungry America; the expectations that <b>this</b> <b>created,</b> together with his role as a hands-on record company boss, meant that the pressure on Harrison was immense.|$|E

5|$|However, after Detroit's {{first round}} {{loss to the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the {{following}} season, he expressed his desire to play again. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph's three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche would {{be looking for a}} goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; <b>this</b> <b>created</b> a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|In April 1898, Schwalbe was recommissioned {{for another}} tour abroad. She first {{returned}} to German East Africa, where the Second Boer War threatened regional stability; British warships began seizing German vessels suspected of carrying contraband to the Boers. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> a major diplomatic incident and Schwalbe {{was sent to}} protect German shipping in the area. The outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China in 1900 {{proved to be more}} pressing, and so Schwalbe was sent to join the Eight Nation Alliance that had formed to crush the Boxers. During her deployment to China, she helped blockade the Yangtze and sent landing parties ashore to control unrest in Ningpo. In mid-1902, she was recalled to Germany for a second time, was overhauled, and was again decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|Life for Sarah {{during the}} reign of William and Mary was difficult. Although the new King and Queen had awarded Sarah’s husband the title Earl of Marlborough, Sarah and John enjoyed {{considerably}} less favour than they had {{during the reign}} of James II. The new Earl of Marlborough had supported the now exiled James; and by this time Sarah’s influence on Anne, and her cultivation of high members of the government to promote Anne’s interests, was widely known. Mary II responded to this by demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah. However, Anne refused. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> a rift between Mary and Anne that never healed.|$|E
5|$|One {{check on}} a magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office {{would be held}} {{concurrently}} by at least two people. Another such check was provocatio. Provocatio was a primordial form of due process. It was a precursor to habeas corpus. If any magistrate tried to use {{the powers of the}} state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their imperium extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that office.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} legislation involved {{two measures}} to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), {{and a new}} Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and <b>this</b> <b>created</b> enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|Shazly {{then went}} southward to 7th Division's {{bridgehead}} in Third Army's sector, where traffic was almost at a standstill. Shazly met with 7th division commander Brigadier General Badawy, who informed {{him of the}} bridge-laying problems experienced by 19th Division's engineers further south, leading all Third Army supplies and reinforcements to be sent over 7th Division's already congested bridges, creating a solid traffic jam. Despite Sunday's lull, the situation had not yet improved. <b>This</b> <b>created</b> complications, as soldiers and tank crews lost contact with their units and consequently {{had no idea of}} their designated positions. Many troops were low on supplies, and some even returned to {{the west bank of the}} canal to replenish their food and water supply.|$|E
