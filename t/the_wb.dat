5|$|Billie Jenkins is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{who appeared in}} the American television supernatural drama Charmed, which aired on <b>the</b> <b>WB</b> Television Network (<b>The</b> <b>WB)</b> from 1998 to 2006. The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by Kaley Cuoco. Billie was developed in response to The WB's request for a new character, and was originally intended to expand the show {{in a new direction}} for a possible ninth season or a spin-off series. The opinions of media outlets were divided on whether she should return for a Charmed reboot or a cast reunion.|$|E
5|$|Despite the series' {{success on}} Fox Kids, Animaniacs on Kids' WB was only {{successful}} in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children. This unintended result of adult viewers {{and not enough}} young viewers put pressure on <b>the</b> <b>WB</b> network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from <b>the</b> <b>WB</b> network towards Animaniacs. Slowly, orders from <b>the</b> <b>WB</b> for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs had a couple more short seasons, relying on leftover scripts and storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with Animaniacs. The 99th and final Animaniacs episode was aired on November 14, 1998.|$|E

The series' cancellation, along with that of other black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and the number of roles for African American actors on television. Critical response to Eve was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to other black sitcoms. Despite the negative reception, the show and Eve received several award nominations. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.|$|E
