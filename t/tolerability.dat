5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior <b>tolerability</b> compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve <b>tolerability.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and <b>tolerability.</b> Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in <b>tolerability</b> are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} playing music improves patient <b>tolerability</b> of the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{evidence}} {{is available to}} support a particularly good profile in terms of gastrointestinal <b>tolerability.</b>|$|E
25|$|No {{high quality}} {{evidence}} exists that suggests synthetic cannabinoids help with fibromyalgia, {{and in general}} <b>tolerability</b> is poor.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale trials {{confirmed}} {{the effectiveness of}} lovastatin. Observed <b>tolerability</b> continued to be excellent, and lovastatin {{was approved by the}} US FDA in 1987. It was the first statin approved by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|As {{haloperidol}} is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, {{it tends}} to produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and <b>tolerability</b> of 15 antipsychotic drugs {{it was the most}} prone of the 15 for causing extrapyramidal side effects.|$|E
25|$|Glaxo refined {{the model}} further by {{replacing}} the imidazole-ring of cimetidine with a furan-ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, {{and in doing}} so developed ranitidine. Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved <b>tolerability</b> profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and ten times the activity of cimetidine.|$|E
25|$|High dose {{estrogen}} {{therapy with}} estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol, ethinylestradiol, and estradiol undecylate {{has been used}} in the past to treat prostate cancer in men. It is effective because estrogens are functional antiandrogens, capable of suppressing testosterone levels to castrate concentrations and decreasing free testosterone levels by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production. High dose estrogen therapy is associated with poor <b>tolerability</b> and safety, namely severe gynecomastia and cardiovascular complications such as thrombosis, and for this reason, has largely been replaced by newer antiandrogens such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It is still sometimes used in the treatment of prostate cancer however, and newer estrogens with atypical profiles such as GTx-758 that have improved <b>tolerability</b> profiles are being studied for possible application in prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{with other}} newer {{antidepressants}} are subtle and mostly confined to side effects. It {{is similar in}} <b>tolerability</b> profile to other SSRIs, with the types of adverse events usually including diarrhea, nausea, and sexual dysfunction. The incidence of diarrhea was higher with sertralineespecially when prescribed at higher dosesin comparison to other SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|In a pooled {{analysis}} of 7 comparative trials with imipramine, milnacipran and imipramine {{were shown to}} have comparable efficacy while milnacipran was significantly better tolerated. A pooled {{analysis of}} studies comparing milnacipran and SSRIs concluded a superior efficacy for milnacipran with similar <b>tolerability</b> for milnacipran and SSRIs. A more recent meta-analysis of 6 studies involving more than 1,000 patients showed no distinction between milnacipran and SSRIs in efficacy or discontinuation rates, including discontinuation for side effects or lack of efficacy. A meta-analysis {{of a total of}} 16 randomized controlled trials with more than 2200 patients concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and <b>tolerability</b> when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressant agents. However, compared with TCAs, significantly fewer patients taking milnacipran dropped out due to adverse events. As with other antidepressants, 1 to 3 weeks may elapse before significant antidepressant action becomes clinically evident.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline is {{used for}} a number of medical {{conditions}} including major depressive disorder (MDD). Some evidence suggests amitriptyline may be more effective than other antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), although it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer <b>tolerability.</b> It is used in addition to other medications for pain.|$|E
25|$|An {{erythematous}} rash in sun-exposed {{parts of}} the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the <b>tolerability</b> of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressants are {{recommended}} {{as an alternative}} or additional first step to self-help programs {{in the treatment of}} bulimia nervosa. SSRIs (fluoxetine in particular) are preferred over other antidepressants due to their acceptability, <b>tolerability,</b> and superior reduction of symptoms in short-term trials. Long-term efficacy remains poorly characterized. Bupropion is not recommended for the treatment of eating disorders due to an increased risk of seizure.|$|E
25|$|It has {{a similar}} <b>tolerability</b> profile to other SSRIs. The common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble {{sleeping}} and delayed ejaculation. It may also {{be associated with a}} slightly increased risk of birth defects. The rate of withdrawal symptoms in young people may be higher with paroxetine and venlafaxine than other SSRIs and SNRIs. Several studies have associated paroxetine with suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents.|$|E
25|$|Tianeptine {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in depression in Parkinson's disease and in post-traumatic stress disorder of which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide. A clinical trial has been conducted to compare its efficacy and <b>tolerability</b> with amitriptyline in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. The results of this trial showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced less prominent adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation.|$|E
25|$|A Lancet review {{found that}} it is in the middle range of 15 {{antipsychotics}} for effectiveness, approximately as effective as haloperidol and quetiapine and slightly more effective than ziprasidone and chlorpromazine, with better <b>tolerability</b> compared to the other antipsychotic drugs (4th best for weight gain, 5th best for extrapyramidal symptoms, best for prolactin elevation, 2nd best for QTc prolongation, and 5th best for sedation). The authors concluded that for acute psychotic episodes aripiprazole results in benefits in some aspects of the condition.|$|E
25|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} escitalopram compared to its predecessor citalopram. The importance of this issue follows from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers citalopram prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. The most recent of these have concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and <b>tolerability.</b>|$|E
25|$|A wakefulness-promoting {{agent that}} {{operates}} {{primarily as a}} selective, relatively weak, and atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Double-blind randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and <b>tolerability</b> of modafinil in pediatric ADHD, however there are risks of serious side effects such as skin reactions and modafinil is not recommended for use in children. In the United States, it was originally pending marketing on-label as Sparlon, but approval was denied by the FDA due to major concerns over the occurrence of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Physiotherapy {{is vital}} in the {{treatment}} of many rheumatological disorders. Occupational therapy can help patients finding alternative ways for common movements which would otherwise be restricted by their disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often need a long term, coordinated and a multidisciplinary team approach towards management of individual patients. Treatment is often tailored according to the individual needs of each patient which is also dependent on the response and the <b>tolerability</b> of medications. Rheumasurgery has also played an integral part {{in the treatment}} of rheumatic disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{daily dose}} of {{reserpine}} in antihypertensive treatment is as low as 0.1 to 0.25mg. The use of reserpine as an antipsychotic drug had been nearly completely abandoned, but more recently it made a comeback as adjunctive treatment, {{in combination with other}} antipsychotics, so that more refractory patients get dopamine blockade from the other antipsychotic, and dopamine depletion from reserpine. Doses for this kind of adjunctive goal can be kept low, resulting in better <b>tolerability.</b> Originally, doses of 0.5mg to 40mg daily were used to treat psychotic diseases.|$|E
25|$|Duloxetine was {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of major depression in 2004. While duloxetine has demonstrated improvement in depression-related symptoms compared to placebo, comparisons of duloxetine to other antidepressant medications have been less successful. A 2012 Cochrane Review did not find greater efficacy of duloxetine compared to SSRIs and newer antidepressants. Additionally, the review found evidence that duloxetine has increased side effects and reduced <b>tolerability</b> compared to other antidepressants. It thus did not recommend duloxetine as a first line treatment for major depressive disorder, given the (then) high cost of duloxetine compared to inexpensive off-patent antidepressants and lack of increased efficacy. Generic duloxetine became available in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Although {{clomipramine}} {{is similarly}} or {{more effective in}} the treatment of OCD compared to SSRIs, it is greatly inferior to them in terms of <b>tolerability</b> and safety due to its lack of selectivity for the SERT and promiscuous pharmacological activity. In addition, clomipramine has high toxicity in overdose and can potentially result in death, whereas death rarely, if ever, occurs with overdose of SSRIs. It is for these reasons that clomipramine, in spite of potentially superior effectiveness to SSRIs, is now rarely used as a first-line agent {{in the treatment of}} OCD, with SSRIs being used as first-line therapies instead and clomipramine generally being reserved for more severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that children and adolescents are sometimes given antipsychotic drugs as a first-line treatment for mental health problems or behavioral issues other than a psychotic disorder, {{which is not the}} ideal treatment approach for these drugs. In the United States, the usage of these drugs in young people has greatly increased since 2000, especially among children from low-income families. More research is needed to specifically assess the efficacy and <b>tolerability</b> of antipsychotic medications in pediatric populations. Because of the risk of weight gain, metabolic side effects, and cardiovascular changes with antipsychotic use, the use of the drugs in pediatric populations is highly scrutinized.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine is {{prescribed}} {{when the}} onset of an organic disease state manifests through anxiety, as generalized anxiety disorder, or in other more serious cases as psychoneurosis, and is therefore prescribed {{as a means of}} regulating normal function. Hydroxyzine has shown to be as effective as the benzodiazepine drug bromazepam in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. However, a systematic review concluded that compared with other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and <b>tolerability,</b> however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to the high risk of bias in the reviewed studies.|$|E
25|$|It is TGA-labeled for {{migraine}} prevention, also {{in cases}} of neuropathic pain disorders, fibromyalgia and nocturnal enuresis. Amitriptyline is a popular off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although it is most frequently reserved for severe cases of abdominal pain in patients with IBS because {{it needs to be}} taken regularly to work and has a generally poor <b>tolerability</b> profile, although a firm evidence base supports its efficacy in this indication. Amitriptyline can also be used as an anticholinergic drug in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease if depression also needs to be treated. Amitriptyline is the most widely researched agent for prevention of frequent tension headaches.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} and adolescents, fluoxetine is the antidepressant of choice due to tentative evidence favoring its efficacy and <b>tolerability.</b> In pregnancy, fluoxetine {{is considered a}} category C drug. Evidence supporting {{an increased risk of}} major fetal malformations resulting from fluoxetine exposure is limited, although the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK has warned prescribers and patients of the potential for fluoxetine exposure in the first trimester (during organogenesis, formation of the fetal organs) to cause a slight increase in the risk of congenital cardiac malformations in the newborn. Furthermore, an association between fluoxetine use during the first trimester and an increased risk of minor fetal malformations was observed in one study.|$|E
25|$|The European League Against Rheumatism in 2008 {{recommends}} tramadol {{and other}} weak opioids {{may be used}} for pain but not strong opioids. A 2015 review found fair evidence to support tramadol use if other medications do not work. Goldenberg et al suggest that tramadol works via its serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, rather than via its action as a weak opioid receptor agonist. The combination of tramadol and paracetemol has demonstrated efficacy, safety and <b>tolerability</b> (for up to two years in the management of other pain conditions) without the development of tolerance. It is as effective as a combination of codeine (another mild opioid) and paracetamol but produces less sleepiness and constipation.|$|E
25|$|Both ROS-elevating and ROS-eliminating {{strategies}} {{have been developed}} with the former being predominantly used. Cancer cells with elevated ROS levels depend heavily on the antioxidant defense system. ROS-elevating drugs further increase cellular ROS stress level, either by direct ROS-generation (e.g. motexafin gadolinium, elesclomol) or by agents that abrogate the inherent antioxidant system such as SOD inhibitor (e.g. ATN-224, 2-methoxyestradiol) and GSH inhibitor (e.g. PEITC, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)). The result is an overall increase in endogenous ROS, which when above a cellular <b>tolerability</b> threshold, may induce cell death. On the other hand, normal cells appear to have, under lower basal stress and reserve, a higher capacity to cope with additional ROS-generating insults than cancer cells do. Therefore, the elevation of ROS in all cells {{can be used to}} achieve the selective killing of cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of nondrug treatments for insomnia exist. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, such as zopiclone, offer few if any advantages in efficacy or <b>tolerability</b> in elderly persons. Newer agents such as the Melatonin receptor agonists may be more suitable and effective {{for the management of}} chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs remains to be determined.|$|E
25|$|Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and {{methocarbamol}} {{are commonly}} prescribed for {{low back pain}} or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants. Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs. In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use. No drug {{has been shown to}} be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness. Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use. A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, <b>tolerability,</b> and cost.|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine has antihistamine, α2-blocker, and antiserotonergic activity. It is {{specifically}} a potent antagonist or inverse agonist of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors, and the histamine H1 receptor. Unlike many other antidepressants, {{it does not}} inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, nor does it inhibit monoamine oxidase. Similarly, mirtazapine has weak or no activity as an anticholinergic or blocker of sodium or calcium channels, in contrast to most TCAs. In accordance, it has better <b>tolerability</b> and low toxicity in overdose. As an H1 receptor antagonist, mirtazapine is extremely potent, and {{is in fact the}} most potent of all the TCAs and TeCAs. Antagonism of the H1 receptor is by far the strongest activity of mirtazapine, with the drug acting as a selective H1 receptor antagonist at low concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for DPN is unclear. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and amitriptyline), traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar <b>tolerability</b> while the opioids caused more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant {{and the results}} of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The comparative data collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine may be more effective. However, the authors noted that the evidence in favor of duloxetine is much more solid. A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence in support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate, and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications.|$|E
25|$|When {{compared}} with benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines (including zaleplon) appear to offer few significant advantages in efficacy or <b>tolerability</b> among elderly individuals. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia {{has traditionally been}} discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, musculoskeletal impairment, and subsequently {{an increased risk of}} harm to oneself (e.g. falling) and to others (e.g. automotive accidents). Though, quite obviously as the body and brain age, these aforementioned phenomena are expected events, as they occur daily regardless of ingestion of a sedative/hypnotic. Thus, statistically significant and empirical evidence are arguably still absent as dramatic precautions and conclusions are drawn irrespective of the debilitating realities that accompany insomnia and the fact that these medicines do indeed provide assistance to millions of elderly individuals. It is important to distinguish between the extrapolation of potential side effects relative to the vast number of examples, wherein the sedative/hypnotic has proven therapeutically beneficial and appropriate.|$|E
