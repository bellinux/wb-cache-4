40|$|A REPOSITORY IN A SALT DOME IS TO BE BACKFILLED WITH THE MINED SALT. GEOCHEMICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL RETENTION PROPERTIES OF THE BACKFILL HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN CONSIDERED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT CODES DUE TO LACK OF DATA. COLUMNS WERE PREPARED BY PRESSING CRUSHED SALT FROM THE ASSE MINE TO SIMULATE THE CHANGE IN THE FREE VOLUME AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE BACKFILL WITH TIME. INTEGRATED PERCOLATION EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT USING THE DOPED GLASS R 7 T 7 (WITH TC,NP,PU AND AM) AS A CONTINUOUS RADIONUCLIDE SOURCE. THE HYDRODY- NAMIC PARAMETERS OF THE COLUMNS WERE DETERMINED FROM THE SHAPE AND DELAY OF THE CLUTION CURVES OF <b>TRITIATED</b> <b>BRINE.</b> FIRST MEASUREMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT UNDER OXIDIZING CONDITIONS AT ROOM TEM- PERATURE. HARDLY ANY RETENTION COULD BE OBSERVED FOR TC AND NP. THE CLUTION CURVE OF PU SEEMS TO BE INFLUENCED BY KINETIC EFFECTS INDICATING A RETARDATION FACTOR OF ABOUT TEN. IN THE CASE OF AM. A HIGH RETARDATION FACTOR (IS APPROXI- MATELY EQUAL TO 100) WAS MEASURED. THIS WAS VERIFIED IN A DIFFUSION EXPERI- MENT ASSUMING A NON-LINEAR ISOTHERM. THE PARAMETERS OF THE ISOTHERM ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH DATA OBTAINED FROM STATIC ADSORPTION EXPERIMENTSNA-NOT AVAILABL...|$|E
