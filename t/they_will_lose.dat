However, Kelso refused {{to be involved in}} Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> his respect for them as Marines if they go through with the drug profiting, setting in motion the events of the game.|$|E

They beat three teams before moving up into second place in their league. Meanwhile, Burns recovers from his stupor and discovers the check he wrote to Homer. Burns wants to join the team (replacing Otto in the team), but since Burns is a horrible bowler, the team is convinced <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the championship.|$|E
5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign if they believe <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose.</b> A game can also end in a draw in several ways.|$|E

5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket {{walk down}} a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose,</b> but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
5|$|Dynamite Headdy is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King's army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin and the key masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw his head in any direction to attack enemies. His head {{can also be used}} to grab hooks and pull himself up to other platforms. Headdy's health is represented by a spotlight in the corner of the screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> a life.|$|E

5|$|Bashir is {{startled to}} see Kira appear as a Russian spy, who {{introduces}} herself as Colonel Anastasia Komananov, KGB. She has no idea who Major Kira is. Eddington informs Bashir and Garak that they can't shut down the program or let the characters die or else <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the patterns of the other crew members. Komananov explains that a scientist called Dr. Noah is planning {{to take over the}} world using lasers to cut into the Earth's crust resulting in the shrinking of the tectonic plates sinking and causing global flooding. Bashir's orders are to rescue Professor Honey Bare (Dax) from Noah. Falcon (O'Brien) attempts to assassinate Bashir, who must stop Komananov from killing him or else O'Brien's pattern will be lost. Bashir, Garak and Komananov go to a casino in Paris to speak to Duchamps (Worf), an associate of Noah. Bashir manages to buy his way into a meeting with Noah after winning the money at cards but the trio are knocked out by Duchamps using a powdered drug.|$|E
5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{covenant}} Yahweh has promised Israel {{the land of}} Canaan, but the promise is conditional: if the Israelites are unfaithful, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the land. The Deuteronomistic history explains Israel's successes and failures {{as the result of}} faithfulness, which brings success, or disobedience, which brings failure; the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians (721 BCE) and the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians (586) are Yahweh's punishment for continued sinfulness.|$|E
25|$|The game rewards {{the player}} with {{experience}} points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic {{attributes of the}} character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any benefits they have already received from that experience.|$|E
25|$|Spider {{fighting}} or spider derby is a blood sport involving spiders {{that occurs}} in different forms in several areas of the world. Among them are the Philippines, Japan, and Singapore. The fights {{that occur in the}} Philippines and in Japan are staged between females of various species of web weavers. Female spiders will kill a rival if the loser does not quickly flee or receive the aid of a human handler. The contests that are staged in Singapore are fights between male jumping spiders. The males fight only for dominance, and ordinarily the loser will flee, though sometimes <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> a leg in the fight.|$|E

25|$|A {{captured}} foal {{is brought}} to Devon in the United Kingdom to be auctioned. Hoping {{to give it to}} his son Billy, Arthur Narracott bids on the foal; instead, his brother Ted competes with him and bids 30 guineas—an exorbitant amount for the poor farmer, winning the horse. The local drunkard, Ted {{is considered to be a}} coward, for refusing to have fought together with his brother in the earlier Boer War in South Africa. At the auction, Ted used money reserved to pay his farm mortgage. Ted's wife Rose fears <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> their farm. Their son Albert promises to raise the foal and train him for sale. The boy names the foal Joey, and forms a strong bond with him during training.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} often worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a breathable membrane material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface dry suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> most of their insulating properties.|$|E
25|$|While New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a 2D platformer, {{some of the}} {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect (also seen in New Super Mario Bros.) that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. Players can play as either Mario, his brother Luigi or two Toad characters: one blue and one yellow (with the first player always as Mario). Controls {{are similar to those}} of New Super Mario Bros., albeit with the added abilities of spinning in mid-air by shaking the Wii Remote; and picking up, carrying, and throwing other players. The game does not feature online multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, there can be up to four players simultaneously. If players lose a life, but have at least one life in reserve, they will re-emerge encased inside a bubble, and can resume play once another player frees them by touching the bubble or tossing a fire ball, ice ball or Koopa shell (the player can shake the Wii Remote to move their bubble closer to an active player, but they cannot free themselves). If players lose a life and do not have any more lives, they must use a Continue and start over from their last save point with five lives left. Players can also encase themselves inside the bubble by pressing the A button while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters a bubble at the same time (whether through death or by pressing the A button), <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the level and must restart.|$|E

500|$|R.C. Pro-Am is {{a racing}} video {{game in which}} a player {{controls}} a radio-controlled car against three opponents around a track from an overhead [...] isometric perspective. Players use the horizontal buttons on the control pad to steer their car left or right, and they use the other buttons to accelerate, fire weapons, and pause the game. Consisting of 24 tracks total, the goal for each racer is {{to qualify for the}} next race by finishing in the top three in the four-car field. The game ends if players finish in fourth; however, they have two continues in which they can restart the previous race, but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> all points accumulated up to that point. For each successful completion of a race, the player receives a trophy; larger [...] "High Score Trophies", leading up to the [...] "Super Trophy", can also be obtained for achieving high scores.

500|$|The winner now {{controls}} {{three separate}} hands, each staked with one card. A new deck of 52 cards {{that has been}} shuffled and cut is used. Cards are drawn for the contestant, {{one at a time}} and the contestant then chooses a hand in which to place each card. The contestant can use a power chip to dispose of an unwanted card. [...] The contestant can end the round at any time if they fear the next card will cause them to bust on any of the three hands. However, using a power chip forces the contestant to place the next card in a hand or use another chip if one is available; the contestant can only end the round after scoring a 21 in a hand. Getting 21 in one hand wins $1,000; in two hands wins $5,000; and if 21 is scored on all three hands, the contestant wins the grand prize of $25,000. If the contestant busts on any hand, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> all money earned in the bonus round, but retain the $1,000 (and bonus prize, if applicable) from the main game won earlier. On some episodes in season two, the top prize was increased to $50,000 with the other payouts remaining the same.|$|E

Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that."
