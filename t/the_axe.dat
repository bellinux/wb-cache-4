However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and <b>the</b> <b>axe</b> is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E

50|$|An {{ellipsoid}} {{has three}} pairwise perpendicular axes of symmetry which intersect at {{a center of}} symmetry, called {{the center of the}} ellipsoid. The line segments that are delimited on <b>the</b> <b>axes</b> of symmetry by the ellipsoid are called <b>the</b> principal <b>axes,</b> or simply <b>axes</b> of <b>the</b> ellipsoid. If <b>the</b> three <b>axes</b> have different lengths, the ellipsoid is said to be tri-axial or rarely scalene, and <b>the</b> <b>axes</b> are uniquely defined.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} based on a material of 45 battle <b>axes</b> from <b>The</b> Swedish History Museum, both miniature axes and regular boat <b>axes</b> from <b>the</b> middle Neolithic era. The geographical demarcation is the province of Västergötland in Sweden. The aim of the study is to analyze <b>the</b> <b>axes,</b> mainly morphologically and size-wise, to try to understand and define miniature axes in comparison to <b>the</b> regular boat <b>axes.</b> Another intention is to try to reveal if there are any differences between the miniatures and <b>the</b> regular <b>axes</b> regarding importance and function of <b>the</b> <b>axes.</b> <b>The</b> result is presented by dint of several tables of measures and attributes of all <b>the</b> <b>axes</b> as well as numerous scatter plots and pie charts showing physical attributes and signs of use of <b>the</b> <b>axes</b> in question. <b>The</b> results show for instance that miniature axes more often than not are sloppily made and more well-worn compared to <b>the</b> regular boat <b>axes.</b> According to <b>the</b> study this might {{have to do with the}} probability of <b>the</b> miniature <b>axes</b> being made for children...|$|R

5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all <b>the</b> <b>axe</b> heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which <b>the</b> <b>axe</b> head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there are}} no {{covalent}} bonds between <b>the</b> <b>axes</b> and rings, polyrotaxanes are stable due to the high free activation energy (Gibbs energy) needed to be overcome to withdraw rings from <b>the</b> <b>axes.</b> Also, rings are capable of shuttling along and rotating around <b>the</b> <b>axes</b> freely, {{which leads to a}} huge amount of internal degree of freedom of polyrotaxanes. Due to this topologically interlocked structure, polyrotaxanes have many different mechanical, electrical, and optical properties compared to conventional polymers.|$|R
5|$|Stone carvings made of jade or serpentinite are in {{the form}} of {{ceremonial}} axe representing clan's strength and power. These were used to behead enemies during war and during ancestor celebrations known as Pilou. The bottom of the handle represents the particular clan and is embellished with stones and shells. <b>The</b> <b>axe</b> is polished smooth like a disc. Carvings made of soapstone are also popular.|$|E
5|$|The North Somerset Levels are to {{the east}} of Weston-super-Mare, while <b>the</b> <b>Axe</b> valley is {{separated}} by the Isle of Wedmore from the Brue valley. The latter is separated by the Polden Hills from the main wetland of the Parrett/Tone/Cary valleys. The Poldens are a low narrow ridge of Blue Lias with alternating bands of limestone and clay. Because {{of the nature of the}} Levels and Moors, the Poldens have a significant visual impact.|$|E

Young wicked also made a statement that referenced the idea that he may have some featured spots on one of the albums.|$|E

In the present experiment, subjects reproduced dots surrounded by figures for which <b>the</b> <b>axes</b> of symmetry and loci of hypothesized neural interactions differed.

5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of <b>the</b> <b>axe</b> place it at around 3200 BC.|$|E
5|$|Near the coast, {{halfway between}} the Quantocks and the Mendips, and lying {{parallel}} to them, is the low ridge of the Polden Hills. On either side is a coastal plain and wetlands area known as the Somerset Levels, an area of about , much of which is about above sea level. The northeasterly part of the Levels is drained by <b>the</b> <b>Axe</b> and Brue, and the southwesterly part by the Parrett and its main tributary, the Tone. This part of the Levels has traditionally been known as Sedgemoor, and to the east is Glastonbury Tor, an isolated hill projecting from the low-lying plain.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre is {{slightly}} askew of the Historic Axis (Axe historique), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins {{on the east}} in the Louvre courtyard and runs west along the Champs-Élysées. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of <b>the</b> <b>Axe</b> despite past appearances to the contrary. The Louvre {{can be reached by}} the Palais Royal– Musée du Louvre Métro or the Louvre-Rivoli stations.|$|E

5|$|The River Brue rises at Brewham, {{close to}} the county border with Wiltshire. It flows through Bruton and is joined by the rivers Pitt and Alham. The river then flows past East and West Lydford to Baltonsborough and then turns north to Street across Butts Moor, South Moor and Kennard Moor. Originally it then joined <b>the</b> <b>Axe</b> but now it flows west across Westhay Moor, Tealham and Tadham Moors, Chilton Moor, Mark Moor and Huntspill Moor. It is joined by the North Drain and the Hartlake river. In Huntspill Moor the Brue {{is linked to the}} {{man-made}} Huntspill river by the artificial Cripps river. The Brue reaches the sea near Burnham-on-Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be seen that the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to <b>the</b> <b>Axe</b> historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E
5|$|The main {{drainage}} outlets {{flowing through}} the Moors and Levels are the rivers Axe, Brue, Huntspill, Parrett, Tone, and Yeo, together with the King's Sedgemoor Drain, an artificial channel into which the River Cary now runs. Previously, the Cary ran into the Tone while the Brue ran through Meare Pool (now drained) and the Panborough Gap, and then into <b>the</b> <b>Axe.</b> Another accomplishment in the Middle Ages was {{the construction of the}} tidal Pillrow Cut, joining the Brue and Axe.|$|E
