25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, <b>trimipramine,</b> lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, <b>trimipramine,</b> amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Iprindole is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a cyclooctaindole (that is, an indole nucleus {{joined with}} a cyclooctyl ring), and possesses three rings fused {{together with a}} side chain attached in its chemical structure.

50|$|<b>Trimipramine</b> is {{extensively}} metabolized, so its metabolites {{may contribute}} to its pharmacology, including potentially to monoamine reuptake inhibition. In what was the only study to date to have assessed the activity profiles of the metabolites of <b>trimipramine,</b> Haenisch et al. (2011) assayed desmethyltrimipramine, 2-hydroxytrimipramine, and trimipramine-N-oxide in addition to <b>trimipramine</b> and found that these metabolites showed IC50 values for the SERT, NET, and DAT {{similar to those of}} <b>trimipramine</b> (see table to the right). Like other secondary amine TCAs, desmethyltrimipramine was slightly more potent than <b>trimipramine</b> in its norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but less potent in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake. However, desmethyltrimipramine still showed only very weak inhibition of the NET.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimipramine</b> is marketed {{throughout}} the world mainly under the brand name Surmontil. Other notable brand names of <b>trimipramine</b> have included Herphonal, Rhotrimine, Sapilent, Stangyl, and Tydamine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimipramine</b> is a weak but {{significant}} antagonist of the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, and also binds to the D4 receptor (Ki = 275 nM). Interestingly, its affinities for various monoamine receptors including the D2 and 5-HT2A receptors closely {{resemble those of}} the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. In accordance, high doses of <b>trimipramine</b> {{have been found to}} have antipsychotic effects in schizophrenic patients, notably without causing extrapyramidal symptoms, and <b>trimipramine</b> has recently been found to be effective in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with delusional depression. The lack of extrapyramidal symptoms with <b>trimipramine</b> may be related to its affinity for the D4 receptor, these both being properties it shares with clozapine. Unlike other TCAs, but reminiscent of antipsychotics, <b>trimipramine</b> has been found to markedly increase plasma prolactin levels (a marker of D2 receptor antagonism) at a dose of 75 mg/day and to increase nocturnal prolactin secretion at doses of 75 and 200 mg/day. These findings are suggestive of important antidopaminergic actions of <b>trimipramine.</b>|$|E

50|$|The time to peak {{concentrations}} {{following a}} dose is 2 to 4 hours. The typical antidepressant therapeutic range of <b>trimipramine</b> concentrations is 150 to 300 ng/mL. The terminal half-life of <b>trimipramine</b> has been variously {{reported to be}} as little as 8 hours (in plasma) and as long as 24 hours. In any case, the terminal half-life of <b>trimipramine</b> is described as shorter than that of other TCAs, which makes it ideal for use in the treatment of insomnia.|$|E

50|$|In {{clinical}} studies, <b>trimipramine</b> {{has been}} found in doses of 50 to 200 mg/day to significantly increase sleep efficiency and total sleep time and to decrease waking time for up to 3 weeks in patients with insomnia. It also improved subjectively perceived sleep quality and well-being during daytime. Monitoring of patients upon discontinuation of <b>trimipramine</b> found that it did not cause rebound insomnia or worsening of sleep quality in subjective evaluations of sleep, although objective measurements found total sleep time below baseline in a subset of patients during <b>trimipramine</b> withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{various other}} TCAs, <b>trimipramine</b> shows marked {{antagonism}} of presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, potentially resulting in increased dopaminergic neurotransmission. This effect {{has also been}} observed with low-potency tricyclic antipsychotics like thioridazine and chlorprothixene. Notably, these two antipsychotics have been claimed many times to also possess antidepressant effects. As such, blockade of inhibitory dopamine autoreceptors and hence facilitation of dopaminergic signaling could {{be involved in the}} antidepressant effects of <b>trimipramine.</b> However, other authors have attributed the claimed antidepressant effects of antipsychotics like the two previously mentioned to α2-adrenergic receptor antagonism, although <b>trimipramine</b> specifically has only weak affinity for this receptor. Aside from antidepressant effects, low doses of antipsychotics have been found to increase REM sleep, and so dopamine autoreceptor antagonism could be involved in the unique effects of <b>trimipramine</b> in terms of REM sleep and sleep architecture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimipramine</b> {{is a very}} potent antihistamine; it has {{the third}} highest {{affinity}} for the H1 receptor (Ki = 0.27 nM) after mirtazapine (Ki = 0.14 nM) and doxepin (Ki = 0.24 nM) among the TCAs and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). The TeCA mianserin (Ki = 0.40) and the TCA amitriptyline (Ki = 1.0) are also very potent H1 receptor antagonists, whereas other TCAs and TeCAs are less potent. These TCAs and TeCAs, including <b>trimipramine,</b> are far more potent than the standard antihistamine diphenhydramine (approximately 800 times for doxepin and 250 times for <b>trimipramine),</b> and {{are among the most}} potent antihistamines available.|$|E

50|$|<b>Trimipramine</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, and clomipramine. <b>Trimipramine</b> is a derivative of imipramine with a methyl group added to its side chain and {{is also known as}} 2'-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine. The tri- prefix in its name may allude to the fact that its side chain features three methyl groups. <b>Trimipramine</b> is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethyltrimipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), and doxepin. The chemical name of <b>trimipramine</b> is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzob,fazepin-5-yl)-N,N,2-trimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C20H26N2 with a molecular weight of 294.434 g/mol.

50|$|Therapeutic {{concentrations}} of <b>trimipramine</b> are between 0.5 and 1.2 μM (150-350 ng/mL) and hence significant monoamine reuptake inhibition {{would not be}} expected with it or its metabolites. However, these concentrations are nearly 2-fold higher if the active metabolites of <b>trimipramine</b> are also considered, and studies of other TCAs have found that they cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain to levels up to 10-fold those in the periphery. As such, <b>trimipramine</b> and its metabolites might at least partially inhibit reuptake of serotonin and/or norepinephrine, though not of dopamine, at therapeutic concentrations, and this could be hypothesized to contribute {{at least in part}} to its antidepressant effects. This is relevant as Haenisch et al. has stated that these are the only actions known at present which could explain or at least contribute to the antidepressant effects of <b>trimipramine.</b> That said, blockade of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and α2-adrenergic receptors, as with mirtazapine, has also been implicated in antidepressant effects.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} its {{atypical}} nature and different profile of activity, <b>trimipramine</b> {{has been shown in}} head-to-head clinical studies to possess equivalent effectiveness to other antidepressants, including but not limited to other TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, amineptine), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) (e.g., maprotiline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., phenelzine, isocarboxazid), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine). In addition, <b>trimipramine</b> has been found to possess greater anxiolytic effects than other TCAs such as amitriptyline and doxepin in head-to-head comparisons. Indeed, its prominent anxiolytic effects have been said to distinguish it from most other TCAs. The atypicality of <b>trimipramine</b> in relation to its lack of monoamine reuptake inhibition is described as challenging the monoamine hypothesis of depression.|$|E
50|$|Most {{antidepressants}} suppress REM sleep, {{in parallel}} with their alleviation of depressive symptoms (although suppression of REM sleep is not required for antidepressant effects). This includes TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline), TeCAs (e.g., mianserin, maprotiline), MAOIs (e.g., clorgiline, pargyline), and SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, zimelidine, indalpine). <b>Trimipramine</b> is unique {{in that it is}} an exception and produces antidepressant effects without compromising or otherwise affecting REM sleep. Even long-term treatment with <b>trimipramine</b> for up to 2 years has not been found to suppress REM sleep. In addition, <b>trimipramine</b> has been found to decrease nocturnal cortisol levels to normal and to normalize cortisol response in depressed patients; hence, it normalizes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, whereas imipramine and other antidepressants tend to increase nocturnal cortisol secretion.|$|E
