5000|$|Figure 5 is {{an example}} of using both the IIR hilbert (...) {{function}} and the FIR approximation. In the example, a sine function is created by computing the Discrete Hilbert transform of a cosine function, which was processed in four overlapping segments, and pieced back together. As the FIR result (blue) shows, the distortions apparent in the IIR result (red) are not caused by the difference between hn and hNn (green and red in Fig 3). The fact that hNn is tapered (windowed) is actually helpful in this context. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's not windowed enough. Effectively, M = N, whereas the overlap-save method needs M < N.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} Brentano’s theory of {{judgment}} {{is not the}} idea that all judgments are existential judgments (though it is sometimes a very complex enterprise to transform an ordinary judgment into an existential one), <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Brentano made no distinction between object and presentation. A presentation exists as an object in your mind. So you cannot really judge that A does not exist, {{because if you do}} so you also judge that the presentation is not there (which is impossible, according to Brentano’s idea that all judgments have the object which is judged as presentation). Twardowski acknowledged this problem and solved it by denying that the object is equal to the presentation. This is actually only a change within Brentano’s theory of perception, but has a welcome consequence for the theory of judgment, viz. that you can have a presentation (which exists) {{but at the same time}} judge that the object does not exist.|$|E

However, Robinson goes on to write [...] "She's a fantasy wish-fulfillment character with outsized skills, an inhuman reaction time, and a clever answer to every question—but so are the other major Star Wars heroes". Other outlets have argued that the term carries an inherent gender bias, and that categorizing Rey as a [...] "Mary Sue" [...] holds her to a double standard as the male characters from the original trilogy did not face comparable criticism. Caroline Framke of Vox wrote [...] "While my kneejerk reaction to criticism of Rey was that it's absolutely in the wrong, I have to admit that questioning her merits isn't inherently misogynistic. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there's an undeniable false equivalence at play".|$|E

The user would then type a formula into [...] "C" [...] that said [...] "A1 times B1" [...] (typically in a form such as [...] or [...] ). Then that formula must be copied into all of the cells in column C, making sure to change the reference to A1 to a new reference for A2, etc. The sheet can automate this to some degree, but <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it simply {{has no idea what}} the formula means.

Professor Richard Holmes made a similar complaint, writing that [...] "Alan Clark's The Donkeys, for all its verve and amusing narrative, added a streak of pure deception to {{the writings of the}} First World War. Its title is based on 'Lions led by Donkeys'. Sadly for historical accuracy, there is no evidence whatever for this; none. Not a jot or scintilla. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such histories have sold well and continue to do so. They reinforce historical myth by delivering to the reader exactly what they expect to read". Clark's work was described as [...] "contemptible" [...] by the Marquess of Anglesey who regarded Clark as the most arrogant and least respectable writer on the War, but this impartiality of this view may have been overshadowed by the fact that Anglesey's own history of the British Cavalry had been reviewed by Clark with the comments [...] "cavalry are nearly always a disaster, a waste of space and resources."

The Black Team wins, and receive the prize of [...] "24 hours of luxury" [...] at a spa in Southern California. While there, the team eats over 15,000 calories total, {{and many of them}} drink and smoke as well. Meanwhile, the Blue Team works out and eats a healthy, low calorie dinner. The next morning, the Black team isn't feeling well, and is sluggish from the fatty foods and alcohol they had consumed. When they get back to the ranch, Helen says they should conceal from Jillian their gorging. But Jillian has already been informed of the events via crew members, and reams out the team for their irresponsibility. Filipe gets angry and has an emotional confrontation with Jillian, in which he complains that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she won't work with him and he feels rejected. He storms out and Sione follows. They approach Bob and tell them about their confrontation, and ask him to train them; Bob agrees. At the weigh-in, many of the Black Team are shocked at their poor performance - Filipe loses only one pound, and Tara did not lose anything, with Laura gaining 1 pound. But the Black team wins the weigh-in 3-2. The three original Bob team members who are on the Blue Team - Cathy, Kristin, and Ron - have been voting as a bloc, and they decide to vote off Mandi, a former Jillian team member, because their only other option is her sister Aubrey, but they feel Aubrey needs the ranch more than Mandi, who gained two pounds at the weigh-in. Laura still has an extra vote that she won the previous week, so she and Mandi and Aubrey decide to vote for Cathy, which will cause a tie and force the Black Team to decide who to vote off. The Black Team has decided to vote off Aubrey, as she is a bigger threat than Mandi, and also, since the former Bob Team members of the Black Team are sticking together, they don't have the votes to vote off Cathy or Ron.|$|E
