40|$|Introduction. This paper {{presents}} the findings and {{discussions of the}} qualitative analysis of users' information seeking articulation in interpersonal interactions. The discussion {{is focused on the}} role of the <b>topic</b> and <b>comment</b> in communicating the user's cognitive uncertainty and certainty in the quest for salient information seeking interaction effectiveness. Method. The qualitative analysis was done on the basis of the sequence of the uncertainty and certainty and the <b>topic</b> and <b>comment</b> in the user's utterances during the interaction in order to explore the use of these elements. Results. The findings suggested some patterns in the employment of uncertainty and certainty and <b>topic</b> and <b>comment.</b> Users initiated the need description with uncertainty and then provided certainty to describe the need in detail. Both <b>topic</b> and <b>comment</b> were used in every stage of information seeking interaction, on the basis of which the source person provided information. Conclusion. The study confirmed that the user's certainty and uncertainty are important for describing the user's information need and that both <b>topic</b> and <b>comment</b> are essential to communicate the need...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} word order variations and transitivity choices in Inuit by examining the interplay and respective influence of morpho-syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features on the surface ordering of clausal constituents. The analysis of a modern-day Inuit text in East Greenlandic (Tunumiisut) shows that the pertinence of an SOV order requires certain qualifications because of the limited representation of lexical nominal groups. However, once these adjustments have been taken into account, both transitivity and surface ordering can be seen to have an important impact on pragmatic <b>topic</b> <b>comment</b> reordering principles. The theoretical flexibility commonly attributed to constituent ordering in Inuit appears to be reserved primarily for signaling particular pragmatic arrangements...|$|E

While most information retrieval models make the assumption that relevant documents are about the query and that aboutness can be captured considering bags of words only, we rather consider a more sophisticated analysis of discourse to capture document relevance by distinguishing the topic of a text from what is said about the <b>topic</b> (<b>comment)</b> in the text. The topic-comment structure of texts is extracted automatically from the first retrieved documents which are then re-ranked so that the top documents {{are the ones that}} share their topics with the query. The evaluation on TREC collections shows that the method significantly improves the retrieval performance...|$|E
40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{difficulties}} of native English speakers in acquiring the Chinese word order, aiming to relate it to the markedness theories. According to the Differential Markedness Hypothesis (DMH), the degrees of learner difficulty in second language acquisition can be predicted according to the degrees of typological markedness between learners ’ first language (L 1) and their second language (L 2). The study employs a grammaticality judgment task in which English Chinese learners were asked to judge four categories of sentence types in Chinese: <b>topic</b> <b>comment,</b> pro-drop, locative inversion, and canonical SVO order. Results show that subjects demonstrate a similar pattern of error rates among those four sentences: all learners have higher degrees of learning difficulty in topic-comment and pro-drop sentences, but lower degrees of difficulty in locative inversion and canonical SVO sentences. The study mostly supports the hypothesis, suggesting the instructional importance of realizing the typological markedness relations between the L 1 and the L 2...|$|E

40|$|Declarative clauses in Old High German (OHG) display V 1 - and V 2 -orders. In this paper, we {{show that}} verb {{placement}} in OHG is determined by information-structural (IS-) conditions: the verb serves to separate the aboutness topic {{from the rest of}} the clause (the comment). In this system, V 1 -clauses appear in sentences that lack a topic-comment division. The generalization of the V 2 rule in German came about by extending the pattern representing <b>topic</b> <b>comment</b> structures onto sentences representing other discourse relations. In this process, the sentence-initial position was IS-neutralized, supporting an analysis of V 2 in the modern language as verb movement to a unique head position with an EPP-feature. We compare this scenariowith the system of verb placement in Old English (OE) and argue that English did not develop a generalized V 2 rule, since the position of the verb inOEdid not serve to separate a special topic {{from the rest of the}} clause, but separated all background elements from the focus domain of the clause. Finally, we argue that the V 2 -pattern in OHG derives from a construction inwhich a topic and a V 1 -clause were juxtaposed. Thus, the historic scenario as a whole provides support for the analysis of V 2 in German as being derived from an original V 1 system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMuch {{work has}} been done on focus (and the related {{concepts}} of <b>topic,</b> <b>comment,</b> theme and rheme) in Spanish and Italian, with the majority concentrating on the ways in which word order is used to convey the interpretation of a grammatical element as the focus of the sentence (e. g. Bolinger 1954, 1954 - 1955; Contreras 1978, 1980 for Spanish and Antinucci and Cinque 1977; Benincà, Salvi and Frison 1988 for Italian). However, in traditional accounts of focus in these two languages, intonation has received very little consideration. A typical treatment is that of Bolinger (1954 - 1955) who, in a footnote in his article "Meaningful word order in Spanish" says that he has left intonation out of his account "in order not to complicate matters" (56). Despite the recognition by Bolinger and some other scholars that intonation is likely to be involved in conveying narrow focus, there remains a widely accepted division between languages that mark narrow focus through word order (without necessarily changing intonation pattern) and those that mark it through intonation alone (i. e. without a focal word order per se). Even in a book dedicated to intonation, this belief is evident: Ladd (1996 : 191) claims that in word order languages sentences like The COFFEE machine broke generally invert the subject and verb, resulting in, for example, S'è rotta la CAFFETTIERA in Italian, with the focal word occurring {{at the end of the}} utterance. Ladd goes on to say that "Word order modifications in languages like Spanish and Italian may indirectly achieve the accentual effects that English accomplishes directly by manipulating the location of the nuclear accent" (191). This type of statement not only maintains the traditional division between word order languages and intonation languages in the marking of narrow focus, but it also makes one wonder at how one way of marking narrow focus is more "direct" than the other. What is more, a number of Romance languages appear to use special tunes to express narrow as opposed to broad focus (e. g. Grice, 1995 for Palermo Italian; D'Imperio 2000, 2002 for Neapolitan Italian; Sosa 1999 for American Spanish; Frota 1995 for European Portuguese). There are two types of evidence that lead us to reconsider the traditional division between languages that mark narrow focus with word order and those that mark it with intonation. The first is that native speakers of Spanish and Italian have the intuition that they can emphasize a particular word of an utterance without manipulating word order. The second type of evidence comes from our recent experimental studies (e. g. Face 2001, 2002 a, 2002 b, 2002 c, 2003 for Castilian Spanish and D'Imperio 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 for Neapolitan Italian; see Section 2. 2) that have begun to look at the ways in which intonation is used as a marker of narrow focus in these two languages. Of particular interest to the issue of a typology based on word order and intonational marking of focus is that the intonational markers of narrow focus found in these studies do not simply accompany changes in word order. Rather they are used independently of word order to mark narrow focus in cases where the canonical broad focus SVO word order is employed. While intonation is used in Spanish and Italian to mark narrow focus, it is also important to point out that the traditional view is not without foundation. Both Spanish and Italian also use changes in word order to mark narrow focus, but the interaction of word order and intonation is different in the two languages. Therefore we propose a revision of the word order vs. intonation focal typology that is less rigid and that more adequately accounts for the differences between Spanish and Italian on the one hand and English on the other, and that also deals with the differences between Spanish and Italian. The varieties of the two Romance languages we will focus on are respectively the Castilian variety for Spanish and the Neapolitan variety for Italian since both have been extensively covered by recent experimental literature...|$|E
