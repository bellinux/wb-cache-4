5|$|Marilyn Waring {{described}} how {{the exclusion of}} non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{conditions}} for GDP development (that is met in premature but not adult brain) is that GABA action on these stages should be excitatory rather than inhibitory. This {{is caused by a}} much higher concentration of Cl− concentration in the cytoplasm of neonatal neurons. Further, the expression of the chloride transporter, KCC2, is less in immature neurons, as a result of which there is the above-mentioned high intracellular chloride. On receiving a GABAergic stimulus, there is an efflux of Chloride from the cell, resulting in depolarization of the cell. This causes <b>the</b> <b>GDPs.</b> Once <b>the</b> KCC2 expression is relatively high, as in the adult, mature neurons, <b>the</b> <b>GDPs</b> almost simultaneously disappear. The increased level of KCC2 expression in adult, mature neurons alone is not the reason for the disappearance of <b>the</b> <b>GDPs,</b> however.|$|R

40|$|Background On July 1 st 2013 the Mandatory Reporting Code Act {{came into}} {{force in the}} Netherlands, making it {{compulsory}} for health professionals to adhere to a reporting code when they suspect patients to be {{victims of domestic violence}} (DV) or child abuse (CA). The Royal Dutch Dental Association (KNMT) developed a reporting code for dental professionals (RCD). Moreover, an e-learning module about DV has been developed. A web-survey was conducted to investigate how general dental practitioners (<b>GDPs)</b> deal with <b>the</b> RCD and what their experiences are with (signs of) DV and CA. Methods In April 2014 1038 GDPs were invited by e-mail to participate in a web-survey consisting of 24 items, through the KNMT Data Stations Project. The data was analyzed using SPSS (RELIABILITY, CHISQ and ANOVA). Results Of all GDPs invited to participate 264 (25 %) responded. 82 % of these GDPs are aware of their obligation to use the reporting code. 54 % of <b>the</b> <b>GDPs</b> are in favor of this obligation. 76 % of <b>the</b> <b>GDPs</b> have taken notice of the KNMT’s RCD and 51 % of <b>the</b> <b>GDPs</b> have implemented <b>the</b> reporting code {{in one form or another}} in their practice. 24 % of <b>the</b> <b>GDPs</b> stated having suspected DV during the last twelve months in the case of 2. 4 patients on average. 81 % took note of this in the patient’s record and 58 % also took action in different ways. 54 % wants to complete the e-learning module. Conclusions Most GDPs are aware of the new legislation and have taken cognizance of the RCD. Even though <b>the</b> majority of <b>GDPs</b> are not opposed to using a reporting code, over half of them have not yet implemented the code in practice. An important factor in this regard seems to be that a substantial minority of <b>the</b> <b>GDPs</b> says they are not sufficiently informed about aspects of reporting a case and about the steps they have to take...|$|R
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, <b>the</b> <b>GDP</b> {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times <b>the</b> <b>GDP</b> of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E
