25|$|According to an {{inscription}} {{found in the}} Santa Cruz church, its consecration took place in year 738 and was presided by a vates called Asterio. The word vates is uncommon in Catholic documents and epitaphs, where the word presbyterus (for Christian priests) is preferred. On the other hand, vates was used in Latin to denote a poet with clairvoyance powers {{and according to the}} Ancient Greek writers Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Posidonius, the vates (ουατεις) were also one of three classes of Celtic priesthood, the other two being the druids and the bards. Some historians think that Asterio held a religious office which combined elements of the pagan and Christian religions, while others <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be linked to the Brythonic refugees that settled in Britonia (Galicia) in the 6th century: The Parrochiale Suevorum (an administrative document of the Kingdom of the Suebi) tells that the lands of Asturias belonged to the Britonian see, and {{it is a fact that}} some features of the Celtic Christianity penetrated in Northern Spain, like the Celtic tonsure which was condemned by the Visigoth bishops who assisted to the Fourth Council of Toledo.|$|E

6000|$|CHR. O, said Christian, I know him; {{he is my}} townsman, my near neighbour; {{he comes}} from the place where I was born. How far do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be before? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,' she replied; 'you're right sickly yet. He's not dead; Doctor Kenneth <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> last another day. I met him on {{the road}} and asked.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> {{speak as}} <b>he</b> likes to a poor clerk; but my mood is not, perhaps, so supple as he deems it, and his rough freedom pleases me not at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{really is}} very late. It is absurd to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have got drowned; {{but if he}} were washing about {{at the bottom of}} the sea, his hair loose on the water!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you {{not hear}} from the {{housekeeper}} {{that there was a}} report of Anne Catherick having been seen in this neighbourhood? Don't you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have gone away to look for her?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No; I still <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> come round. Are {{you going}} to stay here yourself?" [...] said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt question, which made him uneasy, though in reality it was not due to any {{suspicious}} conjecture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{he was not}} {{so strong}} as you suppose. I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have had some secret trouble. With your assent, I will put {{one or two of}} these papers in my pocket, in case they should bear upon our future inquiry." ...|$|E

25|$|In William Henry Hudson's 1887 romance, A Crystal Age, {{the protagonist}} falls {{down a hill}} into a Utopian, asexual, {{pastoral}} paradise; since he falls into this world, it is sometimes classified as a hollow earth story; although, the hero himself, <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have traveled forward in time, by millennia.|$|R
6000|$|Under the {{influence}} of these feelings, she answered hastily, [...] "That his Majesty has good subjects in England, my Lord Duke, he is bound to thank God and the laws--that he has subjects in Scotland, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> thank God and his sword." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said I. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may,</b> {{and if he}} breakfasts here he {{can take}} what we've got. If the eggs are not fresh enough for him he can try {{to get along with}} some bacon. He can't expect that to be fresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|Doctor Winchester's {{comment and}} my own were made at the same moment. I said only the one word [...] "Checkmate!"

6000|$|... 'You'd hardly think, {{would you}} now,' said Price, turning towards Mr. Pickwick, 'that that chap's {{been here a}} week yesterday, and never once shaved himself yet, because he feels so certain he's going out in half an hour's time, <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> as well put it off till he gets home?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not. As far as I {{can judge}} he {{is a good}} boy still. I make him my escort to church, so that I am sure of him there. Renville would have taken him for a boy about his studio, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will go there eventually; but Camilla <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be an {{attraction}} at the bazaar, and is making him draw for it." ...|$|R
2500|$|If {{anyone else}} <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have {{confidence}} in the flesh, I more so: circumcised on the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.” ...|$|R
60|$|And now he's {{surprised}} and pleased. I've met her. Poor dear, she did everything {{to make me}} like her, because Ronny was my brother. She's awfully pretty. He's {{not in love with}} her yet. But I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> be. He's on the brink and if there were nothing else he'd fall over.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> refuse, Jeanne. He {{is proud}} of his {{integrity}} and incorruptibility, and I think it quite possible that he may refuse to grant Marie's release {{in return for a}} benefit done him personally. However, do not let that discourage you in the least. As I said, I will have the order by fair means or foul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must ask}} him for it {{yourself}} then; I'll not propose to him any such thing.

500|$|In 2007, Wood {{revived the}} Irish theory, {{questioning}} whether Flodoard's [...] "Israel Britto" [...] means [...] "Breton", and stating that Ruotger knew Israel.

50|$|At nighttime, Sheldon {{knocks on}} Leonard's bedroom in distress, {{claiming}} to have cholera. When Leonard dismisses this, he suggests some equally unlikely alternatives, while Leonard <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have appendicitis.
