5|$|After seeing <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17M V1 at the Zürich air {{races in}} 1937, the Yugoslav Royal Air Force bought license rights for {{production}} at the Drzavna Fabrika Aviona factory in 1938. They equipped it with the more powerful Gnome-Rhône 14N radial engine (although the French exaggerated its performance) Dornier designs were delivered to the Pomorsko Vazduhoplovstvo (Naval Aviation - PV) in 1926, namely the Dornier Komet and Dornier Do Y heavy bombers. The Yugoslavs were familiar with Dornier designs, and on 19 November 1935 Yugoslav pilots test-flew <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17 V-3 prototype, D-ABIH, W.Nr. 258. They decided to select <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17 for service, despite it being more expensive than any other aircraft, because of the German willingness to deliver them quickly without limitations on numbers.|$|E

The German bombers had flown east of Canterbury and thereby avoided the main concentration of fighters on the Canterbury-Margate line. At 13:01 they passed over Ashford and had a clear 65km (40 mile) run before they reached Biggin Hill and its four defending squadrons.|$|E

The successor of <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17 was the much more powerful Dornier Do 217, which started to appear in strength in 1942. Even so, <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17 continued service in the Luftwaffe in various roles {{until the end of}} the war, as a glider tug, research and trainer aircraft. A considerable number of surviving examples were sent to other Axis nations as well as countries like Finland. Few Dornier Do 17s survived the war and the last was scrapped in Finland in 1952.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Do</b> 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. <b>The</b> <b>Do</b> 17 prototype V8 {{was used to}} test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Do</b> 17L-0 and Do 17M-0 were {{developed}} in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs, the L being the reconnaissance version.

The first prototype of the revised version, <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of 425km/h (264mph).|$|E

3000|$|... 5 <b>The</b> <b>Doing</b> Business {{ranking of}} {{countries}} {{calculated from the}} BEEPS data closely matches the ranking provided by <b>the</b> <b>doing</b> business indicators. Since 2012 <b>the</b> <b>Doing</b> Business indicators include an overall “ease of doing business” rank for all countries that {{are included in the}} database (see, e.g., World Bank 2012). Comparing <b>the</b> “ease of <b>doing</b> business” rank with the BEEPS based index it turns out that Romania is poorly ranked in both data sets. In a similar vein, the Baltic States are among the most business-friendly CEE economies in both sources. However, Lithuania forms a notable exception because it is highly ranked in <b>the</b> <b>doing</b> business indicators but among the group of more business-unfriendly economies when looking at the BEEPS data. The main {{reason for this is that}} the BEEPS data end in 2009 while <b>the</b> “ease of <b>doing</b> business” ranking is only available since 2012. When looking at <b>the</b> <b>Doing</b> Business indicators for Lithuania over time, it turns out that the business environment substantially improved since 2009.|$|R
50|$|Several other {{projects}} are conducted {{with a similar}} purpose of describing business environment in different countries, most notably <b>The</b> <b>Doing</b> Business Report.

5|$|The initial {{production}} variants were <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17E-1 bomber, {{which was}} tested with two Daimler-Benz DB 600, and Do 17F-1 reconnaissance aircraft, powered like the early prototypes with BMW VI engines, which entered production in late 1936.

5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked <b>the</b> <b>Do</b> 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. <b>The</b> <b>Do</b> 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
5|$|At the International Military Aircraft Competition at Zürich, Switzerland in 1937, the Dornier Do 17M V1 {{proved a}} leader in its class and was faster than the fastest foreign fighter, the French Dewoitine D.510. <b>The</b> <b>Do</b> 17, along with the Messerschmitt Bf 109, won many prizes, demonstrating the prowess of German {{aviation}} design.|$|E

LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home.
