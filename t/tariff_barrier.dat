In addition, impacts of tariff are generally realized more quickly and clearly than impacts of non-tariff barriers.

40|$|The {{most common}} non tariff {{barriers}} that affect New Zealand (NZ) trade in apples are phytosanitary ones. This research {{focused on the}} economic analysis {{of this type of}} barrier. It especially refers to the potential apple trade between Australia (importer) and NZ (exporter) which is currently prohibited due to the existence of Fire Blight disease in NZ. A partial equilibrium model of eight simultaneous equations was developed. It was simulated under four alternative policies as a means of determining the effects of a reduction in the Fire Blight phytosanitary barrier. The policies involved changes in the exogenous variables: the non <b>tariff</b> <b>barrier,</b> the cost of the Fire Blight control in NZ and the cost of Fire Blight in Australia. Policy one involved a reduction in the ban without cost requirements for either country. Policy two involved a reduction in the ban and an imposition of requirements for Fire Blight control in NZ in order to minimize the risk of the disease entering Australia. Policy three involved a reduction in the import ban and disease control costs in Australia. Policy four involved a reduction of the import ban and shared disease control costs in both countries. The effects of a reduction in the import ban was evaluated by considering the changes in economic welfare with respect to the base line (current situation) in both countries. The model predicted that the change in the consumer surplus in NZ was negative in all cases, but this was compensated by positive changes in the NZ producer surplus which was almost four times higher. Therefore, in NZ, the changes in total economic welfare were positive for all policy changes. For the Australian market, the model predicted ambiguous welfare effects. The Australian producer surplus was negative but the total consumer surplus was positive and its value varied depending on the particular policy. A rent to the non <b>tariff</b> <b>barrier</b> was established once NZ apple imports were permitted. The rent represented the difference between the import price and the Australian price of apples. The existence of this rent {{is a part of the}} distorting effect of this barrier in the Australian market. This research identified that with a reduction of ten percent of the tariff equivalent of the non <b>tariff</b> <b>barrier,</b> the best alternative policy for both countries was the reduction in the non <b>tariff</b> <b>barrier</b> with shared costs of Fire Blight disease control (policy four) ...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{integration}} has had ambiguous {{effects on}} industry concentration. The {{literature on the}} topic proposes various explanations for these empirical findings. This paper provides an additional theoretical argument. It shows that {{in a world of}} monopolistic competition, integration alone (modelled as a reduction of trade barriers) may exert opposing forces on industry concentration, depending on whether the barrier consists of real (frictional) or tariff costs. In particular, the Herfindahl index of industry concentration falls for a reduction in real costs, but rises for a reduction in tariff costs. The reason is that real barriers burn up resources, such that industry profitability is reduced, reducing entry, and resulting in fewer firms and a correspondingly higher concentration. Under a <b>tariff</b> <b>barrier,</b> the redistributed tariff revenue stabilises industry profitability, resulting in more firms and a lower concentration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Whatever the {{possible}} “potential gains ” from free trade, {{almost all the}} countries in the world have maintained <b>tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade. Consider a small country unable to influence its terms of trade. A tariff usually reallocates the factors of production into the protected sector and shifts domestic demand away from the imported commodity, thereby reducing the country’s imports. Whatever {{the possible}} “potential gains ” from free trade, almost all {{the countries in the}} world have maintained <b>tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade. The only difference among countries has been the degree and the coverage of tariff protection. A tariff is a tax on imports of a commodity that makes the foreign commodity more expensive to domestic consumers and producers. A tariff usually reallocates the factors of production into the protected sector and shifts domestic demand away from the imported commodity, thereby reducing the country’s imports. Once the Uruguay Round agreement has been implemented, average tariffs on manufactured goods for the OECD countries will be about 2 %. However, <b>tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> are still significant in agriculture, and anti-dumping duties, which are equivalent to tariffs, may be quite substantial. Also, the analysis of tariffs provides the basis for the analysis of other types of trade barriers...|$|R
40|$|The Doha {{round of}} {{multilateral}} trade negotiations commits World Trade Organization (WTO) members to improving market access for both agricultural and nonagricultural goods. <b>Tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> on wool products represent a small but important subset of these negotiations. To inform {{the debate on the}} round, we analyze the distortionary effects of recent (1997 - 2005) <b>tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> on wool products using a model that applies a comprehensive analytical approach with regard to the production, trade, and consumption of wool products. We also account for any indirect effects of wool <b>tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> on the nonwool economy by incorporating the production, trade, and consumption of nonwool products, that is, the framework is a comparative-static global general equilibrium model with a detailed representation of the world wool market. Changes in wool tariffs over 1997 - 2005 lead to positive welfare effects for most regions; Italy, China, and the UK are estimated to have gained the most from the changes. The results indicate that the nature of recent wool tariffs severely distort the size of wool industries in different regions. The changes in the output of wool commodities are extreme reflecting the discriminatory nature of the tariffs. Copyright (c) 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|R
