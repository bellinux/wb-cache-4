5|$|A {{month after}} the election, the lame-duck session of the old 67th Congress met. Harding {{had come to believe}} that his early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, {{although}} in vain, to get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress left town in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover, were showing results. Most Republicans realized that there was no practical alternative <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> Harding in 1924.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Bethune first {{supported}} King Stephen, who seized the throne from Henry's heiress the Empress Matilda, but when Matilda's forces captured Stephen, Bethune switched sides to support Matilda. When Matilda did not secure the throne, Bethune once more switched back <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> Stephen. Construction of Hereford Cathedral was completed under Bethune's episcopate, and consecrated in 1142 and 1148. Stephen appointed Bethune {{as one of}} the English bishops that the king allowed to attend the Council of Reims in 1148, and Bethune died there in April 1148. A hagiography is the only surviving evidence of Bethune's cathedral chapter's attempts to promote him as a saint.|$|E

5|$|An {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> {{the possibility}} premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E

Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pitești and {{the other}} Salonul Independenților {{initiators}} joined up with author Ioan Bacalbașa and architect Ștefan Ciocâlteu.

Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, {{as well as by}} the painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative exhibit in 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people. Despite such consolidation, various Ileana affiliates were not entirely committed to the cause, and never severed their links with Stănescu's official section.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Maya had {{diverse and}} {{sophisticated}} methods of food production. It {{was believed that}} shifting cultivation (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food, but it is now thought that permanent raised fields, terracing, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> the large populations of the Classic period in some areas. Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals {{can be seen on}} aerial photographs. Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times, and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, manioc, sunflower seeds, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to, from a caring science perspective, uncover the meaning content in <b>to</b> <b>support</b> as well as it’s pragmatic {{features}} in healthcare leadership, with a focus on nurses’ health. The overall aim is <b>to</b> understand <b>to</b> <b>support</b> as a praxis concept in caring science. The study questions are: What does <b>to</b> <b>support</b> mean in the light of etymology and semantics? What shape has supporting in healthcare leadership with a focus on nurses’ health? The study belongs to the caring tradition and has a hermeneutic approach, where the interest of knowledge lies on understanding. The understanding deepens and the horizon broadens in the hermeneutic process where the preunderstanding goes in dialogue, with dictionaries in an etymological and a semantic analysis, and with peer reviewed articles in a contextual determination of the concept via content analysis. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> as a praxis concept in caring science integrates the concept <b>to</b> <b>support</b> and the supporting way of living. The study result in the following theses: <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> give cause for her to strive for becoming in health. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> place fundaments on which she can securely lean against or rest on. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ not <b>to</b> let her fall. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> confirm her unique dignity. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ genuine presence, where love embraces and unburdens. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> ‒ <b>to</b> act beneficially so she can reach her potential. In healthcare leadership supporting takes the shape of supporting in the meaning of helping, assisting, promoting and subsiding, in the meaning of promoting, favoring and encouraging {{as well as in the}} meaning of establishing. That manifests concrete in that the healthcare leader is present, guides, respects, maintains ethical fundaments, inspire development as well as is equally flexible in creating outer conditions where the nurses’ inner can flourish...|$|R

5|$|Alboin was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 530s in Pannonia, the son of Audoin and his wife, Rodelinda. She {{may have been the}} niece of King Theodoric and betrothed to Audoin through the mediation of Emperor Justinian. Like his father, Alboin was raised a pagan, although Audoin had at one point attempted to gain Byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a Christian. Alboin took as his first wife the Christian Chlothsind, daughter of the Frankish King Chlothar. This marriage, which took place soon after the death of the Frankish ruler Theudebald in 555, is thought to reflect Audoin's decision to distance himself from the Byzantines, traditional allies of the Lombards, who had been lukewarm when it came <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> Audoin against the Gepids. The new Frankish alliance was important because of the Franks' known hostility to the Byzantine empire, providing the Lombards with more than one option. However, the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire interprets events and sources differently, believing that Alboin married Chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561, the year of Chlothar's death.|$|E
