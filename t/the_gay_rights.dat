5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>rights</b> {{ordinance}} was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were not gay simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those who opposed the ordinance were much more motivated.|$|E
5|$|Chaired {{by former}} TD Anne Colley, this working group {{included}} GLEN, <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>rights</b> lobby organisation, {{who said they}} expected a recommendation for civil marriage. The group facilitated a conference on the topic in May 2006, as input to its reports which was attended by experts from other countries which have introduced civil unions and same-sex marriage. During his speech, McDowell was interrupted {{by members of the}} Ancient Order of Hibernians opposed to the Government plans.|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>rights</b> movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E

5|$|Save Our Children was {{the first}} {{organized}} opposition to <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>rights</b> movement, whose beginnings were traced to the Stonewall riots in 1969. The defeat of the ordinance encouraged groups in other cities to attempt to overturn similar laws. In the next year voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, Wichita, Kansas, and Eugene, Oregon overturned ordinances in those cities, sharing {{many of the same}} campaign strategies that were used in Miami. Save Our Children was also involved in Seattle, Washington, where they were unsuccessful, and heavily influenced Proposition 6—a proposed state law in California that would have made the firing of openly gay public school employees mandatory—that was rejected by California voters in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>rights</b> movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking the start of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>rights</b> movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of {{gay men and lesbians}} by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of gay men and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of the {{counterculture}} movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the Summer of Love. In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>rights</b> movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the high-tech industry. Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E
