5|$|After the war, he {{was tried}} at Nuremberg {{and sentenced to}} 20 {{years in prison for}} his role in <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime,</b> principally for the use of forced labor. Despite {{repeated}} attempts to gain early release, he served his full sentence, most of it at Spandau Prison in West Berlin. Following his release in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and , detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on the workings of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime.</b> He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of a stroke in 1981 while on a visit to London.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the Gestapo using a brothel full of spies to find traitors within <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> has been {{recycled}} several times in various European nazi exploitation films.|$|E
5000|$|The German Christians were {{sympathetic}} to <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> goal of [...] "co-ordinating" [...] the individual Protestant churches {{into a single}} and uniform Reich church, consistent with the Volk ethos and the Führerprinzip.|$|R
50|$|Haavara (Transfer) Ltd. was {{a company}} founded {{as a result}} of the Haavara Agreement made during <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> control over Germany. The company {{facilitated}} the emigration of approximately 50,000 Jews from Germany to Palestine.|$|R
5000|$|The Deutsche Christen were {{sympathetic}} to <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> goal of [...] "co-ordinating" [...] (see Gleichschaltung) the individual Protestant churches {{into a single}} and uniform Reich church, consistent with the Volk ethos and the Führerprinzip.|$|R
5|$|Under Hitler's {{leadership}} and racially motivated ideology, <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> {{was responsible for}} the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (sub-humans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians {{died as a result of}} military action in the European theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constituted the deadliest conflict in human history.|$|E
5|$|Existing laws banning {{abortion}} {{except for}} medical reasons were strictly enforced by <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime.</b> The {{number of abortions}} declined from 35,000 per year {{at the start of}} the 1930s to fewer than 2,000 per year at the end of the decade, though in 1935 a law was passed allowing abortions for eugenics reasons.|$|E
5|$|Hitler took up {{residence}} in the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945 and it became the centre of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> until {{the last week of}} World War II in Europe. Hitler married Eva Braun here during the last week of April 1945, shortly before they committed suicide.|$|E
50|$|Alemannia {{is known}} as one of the few of this era to offer any {{challenge}} to <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> purge of Jews from the country's sports organizations by demanding the release of a jailed Jewish member.|$|R
50|$|In {{their enthusiasm}} for <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> support of archaeology, many German archaeologists became pawns and puppets {{of the real}} goals behind the movement. They {{answered}} to the requests of the Ahnenerbe, and not always {{in the interests of}} pure archaeology.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps more {{importantly}} for gauging <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> pro-British feelings {{in its early}} years was the prominence given to Englandkunde (English studies) within German schools and the lavish praise offered to British youth organizations as a model within the Hitler Youth.|$|R
5|$|Meyerbeer's costly operas, {{requiring}} grand casts {{of leading}} singers, were gradually {{dropped from the}} repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> because the composer was Jewish, {{and this was a}} major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the war, Himmler {{intensified}} the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.|$|E
5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists {{across the political spectrum}} who opposed <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime,</b> captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the number of its death sentences.|$|E
5000|$|André François-Poncet (13 June 1887, Provins, Seine-et-Marne [...] - [...] 8 January 1978) was a French {{politician}} and diplomat whose post as ambassador to Germany {{allowed him to}} witness first-hand the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> Party, and <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> preparations for World War II.|$|R

5000|$|His [...] "skoob" [...] ("books" [...] written backwards) works using {{books or}} {{materials}} derived from them {{had the power}} to shock. He moved from collages to towers of books which he then burnt, awakening uncomfortable echoes of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> public burning of banned books.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led {{to a decline in}} the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E
5|$|Authors {{of books}} {{left the country}} in droves and some wrote {{material}} critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths {{and the concept of}} blood and soil. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books—most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters—had been banned by <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored {{the custom of}} playing the Nazi anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded to pressure from Hitler's government not to play the Italian Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet {{among some of the}} players that their presence in Germany gave <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> a propaganda coup.|$|E
50|$|In the epilogue, it is {{revealed}} that the narrator is March's grown-up son. He says Charlie was eventually arrested by the Gestapo. The revelation of the mass slaughter of the Jews derailed any prospect of a strategic alliance with the US, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> collapse.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the tide}} of the war turned against Germany, Terboven's {{personal}} aspiration was to organise a [...] "Fortress Norway" [...] (Festung Norwegen) for <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> last stand. Hitler's successor, Admiral Dönitz, dismissed Terboven from his post as Reichskommissar on 7 May, transferring his powers to General Böhme.|$|R
50|$|In the DC Bombshells continuity, Joker's Daughter serves under <b>the</b> <b>Nazi's</b> <b>Regime</b> during World War II, and aided the Third Reich's {{cause by}} keeping magic users such as Raven and Zatanna under her control. She was {{eventually}} {{defeated by the}} Bombshells and Raven, Zatanna, and Miri Marvel depowered her.|$|R
5|$|Heydrich was {{assigned}} to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime.</b> Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der Stürmer. For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).|$|E
5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} {{to rein in the}} SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E
5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime.</b> Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief {{in the existence of}} a superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 August 1939, Stuckart {{signed a}} {{confidential}} decree regarding the [...] "Reporting Obligations of Deformed Newborns," [...] {{which became the}} basis for <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> euthanasia of children. Two years later, Stuckart's own one-year-old son, Gunther, who was born with Down's syndrome, became a victim of this programme.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Jewish Enemy: <b>Nazi</b> Propaganda During World War II and the Holocaust (Harvard University Press, 2006. [...] ). The work {{examines}} <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> radical anti-Semitic propaganda as {{a bundle}} of hatreds, an explanatory framework, and effort to legitimate mass murder. It won the National Jewish Book Award in 2006 for works on the Holocaust.|$|R
50|$|His courageous New Year's Eve sermons in the Freiburg Münster and his Lenten {{pastoral}} letters became {{especially effective}} with the public. In them he particularly lashed <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime's</b> enmity toward <b>the</b> Church and, according to Schwalbach, assailed euthanasia, {{which he described}} as murder, in the New Year's Eve sermon of 1941.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime</b> {{began to}} persecute Jews {{soon after the}} seizure of power. Hess's office was partly {{responsible}} for drafting Hitler's Nuremberg Laws of 1935, laws that had far-reaching implications for the Jews of Germany, banning marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and depriving non-Aryans of their German citizenship. Hess's friend Karl Haushofer {{and his family were}} subject to these laws, as Haushofer had married a half-Jewish woman, so Hess issued documents exempting them from this legislation.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{caused a}} stir in the upper echelons of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime.</b> In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder {{the distribution of the}} letter.|$|E
5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the crimes of <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regime,</b> for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Advocates {{responding}} to {{criticisms of the}} efficacy of nonviolence point {{to the success of}} non-violent struggles even against <b>the</b> <b>Nazi</b> <b>regimes</b> in Denmark and even in Berlin. A study by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan found that nonviolent revolutions are twice as effective as violent ones and lead to much greater degrees of democratic freedom.|$|R
