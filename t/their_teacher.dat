5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Hermann von Helmholtz, {{following}} {{the work of}} <b>their</b> <b>teacher</b> Johannes Peter Müller showed the electrical inpulses which pass along nerves; but unlike Müller's views, that such impulses were able to be observed. Richard Caton in 1875 demonstrated electrical in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys. In the 1820s, Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of damaging specific parts of animal brains describing the effects on movement and behavior.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sought the}} perceptions of a selected group of Mexican-American community leaders in Tucson, Arizona, concerning their recollected classroom relationships with <b>their</b> <b>teachers.</b> The investigation proceeded {{on the basis of}} a three-part theoretical framework drawn from the literature of psychology, anthropology, and education. The theory included the following: (1) Perceptual Processes; (2) Cultural Processes; and (3) Interpersonal Processes. An interview schedule, based on the elements of the theoretical framework, was developed employing a Likert type scale together with an open-ended comment format. Twenty Mexican-American community leaders were identified and interviewed in depth regarding the perceived relationships that they recalled having had with <b>their</b> respective <b>teachers.</b> Among the findings, the following appeared to be most significant: (1) the participants generally agreed that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> were aware of them; (2) the participants reported perceiving that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> had accepted them; (3) the participants agreed that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> had generally not accepted most aspects of their bicultural being. They reported perceiving that their teachers' thrust appeared to have been toward assimilation; (4) the participants reported that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> seemed not to have cared sufficiently to communicate to them that their bicultural identities were important; (5) the participants reported that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> had not encouraged them to make choices in becoming independent persons. They tended to report that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> had lowered expectations for them and therefore had not adequately challenged them; and (6) the participants perceived that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> had not extended themselves to positively support their cultural identities...|$|R

5|$|Aged six, Castro, {{along with}} his elder {{siblings}} Ramón and Angela, was sent to live with <b>their</b> <b>teacher</b> in Santiago de Cuba, dwelling in cramped conditions and relative poverty, often failing to have enough to eat because of their tutor's poor economic situation. Aged eight, Castro was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, although later became an atheist. Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, and so {{was sent to the}} privately funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago. In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana. Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sport.|$|E

To gain entry into the University to study primary or secondary education, students must not only meet the University's general entry requirements but also {{a number of other}} special course requirements. University students seeking to enter the teaching profession may also become qualified by gaining a postgraduate certificate in education. Two years of professional teaching practice is also generally required.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} study in Nogales, Arizona, was to replicate an investigation conducted by Avelina Trujillo (1982) in Tucson, Arizona. This investigation sought the perceptions of selected groups of Mexican-American leaders in Nogales concerning their recollected classroom relationships with <b>their</b> <b>teachers.</b> The investigation {{was based on a}} three-part theoretical framework drawn from the literature of psychology, anthropology, and education as established by Trujillo (1982). The theory included the following: (1) Perceptual Processes; (2) Cultural Processes; and (3) Interpersonal Processes. The interview schedule utilized in the Nogales study consisted of 29 statements and associated Likert type scales. Provision was made for comments for each statement. Twenty Mexican-American community leaders in Nogales, Arizona, were identified and interviewed, utilizing the interview schedule. This schedule dealt with the perceived relationships which the participants had with <b>their</b> various <b>teachers.</b> Findings indicate: (1) The participants agreed that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> were aware of them and their backgrounds. (2) The participants agreed that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> accepted them and their backgrounds. (3) The participants did not feel that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> neither encouraged bilingualism nor accepted the participants' native language. (4) The participants noted that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> appeared to be sincerely concerned about the academic health and welfare needs of the students. (5) The participants reported that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> aspired for them to acquire good educations. (6) The participants reported that <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> shared with them in their educational and personal problems. The findings from this investigation were compared and contrasted with the findings of the Trujillo (1982) study. The comparison of the data in the two studies was accomplished by computing the differentials (chi square) in perception of each of the 29 items of the interview schedule. Items that were considered to be most significantly different in the two studies were discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{cross-cultural}} {{study examined the}} teacher behaviours that contributed to positive student-teacher relationships with gifted secondary students and secondary students with Emotional/Behavioural Disorders (EBD) in Western Australia and Canada. The study also examined which categories of social support (emotional, instrumental, informational, appraisal) were considered most important in developing positive relationships according to the exceptional students and <b>their</b> <b>teachers.</b> Behaviours were identified through a mixedmethods approach that included surveys, teacher interviews, and student focus groups. Participants included gifted secondary students (N = 133) and <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> (N= 49), and secondary students with EBD (N = 89) and <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> (N= 23) in Western Australia and three Canadian provinces. The data established that both gifted students and <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> valued teacher behaviours that showed respect for students, supported and extended student learning, and promoted cordial and friendly interactions between teachers and students. Gifted students emphasised the importance of informational support, while <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> put {{a greater emphasis on}} emotional support. Students with EBD and <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> both valued teacher behaviours that displayed warmth, understanding, patience, supported students in their learning, and showed flexibility in instruction and in addressing behaviour. Students with EBD and <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> both identified emotional support as the most important type of social support for developing positive relationships. Comparisons between the behaviours that were identified for gifted students and students with EBD revealed a set of core behaviours that were essential for developing positive relationships with both groups, but that each group required a unique set of behaviours to address their unique set of needs. Themes emerging from the data were consistent in Western Australia and Canada, indicating that positive relationships with these exceptional secondary students can be developed using behaviours that transcend borders and cultures...|$|R

5|$|Three years later, Isaac, Garet, and Jenna join <b>their</b> <b>teacher,</b> Kraden, in his {{research}} of Mt. Aleph. Their research coincides with a second raid of the sanctum by Saturos and Menardi, now assisted by Felix and Alex, who coerce Isaac into giving them {{three of the four}} stars. The volcano erupts before they can retrieve the final star, but before escaping they capture Jenna and Kraden as eventual bargaining chips. The guardian of Mt. Aleph, the Wise One, appears before Isaac and Garet and instructs them to prevent Saturos' group from casting the Elemental Stars into their respective Elemental Lighthouses across Weyard; if this happens, Alchemy will be restored and the period of instability will begin anew.|$|E
