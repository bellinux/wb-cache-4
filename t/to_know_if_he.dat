5|$|On the May 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Bischoff lifted Michaels' suspension, after Triple H pleaded that Michaels be reinstated. On the same night, Michaels confronted Bischoff wanting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was {{scheduled}} in a match with Triple H at Bad Blood. Bischoff assured Michaels, but Triple H attacked Michaels from behind, after Michaels attacked Triple H outside the arena's parking lot. Bischoff gave orders to Raw superstars to attack Triple H and Michaels, if seen fighting. The roster tried breaking the fight up, but were unsuccessful in doing so. The {{result of the}} fight gave Bischoff the authority to schedule a Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Michaels at Bad Blood. At Bad Blood, Triple H defeated Michaels by pinfall after executing two Pedigrees.|$|E
25|$|A few {{references}} to men changing into wolves {{are found in}} Ancient Greek literature and mythology. Herodotus, in his Histories, wrote that the Neuri, a tribe he places to the north-east of Scythia, were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days, and then changed back to their human shape. In the second century BC, the Greek geographer Pausanias related the story of Lycaon, who {{was transformed into a}} wolf because he had ritually murdered a child. In accounts by the Bibliotheca (3.8.1) and Ovid (Metamorphoses I.219-239), Lycaon serves human flesh to Zeus, wanting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is really a god. Lycaon's transformation, therefore, is punishment for a crime, considered variously as murder, cannibalism, and impiety.|$|E
25|$|Without Kendall, Reese and Bianca {{exchange}} wedding vows on February 12, 2009. Ryan, however, {{has called}} off his wedding with Greenlee after seeing Zach and Reese kiss. He tells Greenlee {{that he knows}} Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and {{that he does not}} want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams. Greenlee then tries to get in touch with Zach; she wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has really been having an affair with Reese. When Greenlee cannot get in touch with Zach, she drives off on her motorcycle in search of him. Also on the road are Zach and Kendall in a car arguing. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee. Both try to swerve out of the other's way, leaving Greenlee to drive off the road. When Greenlee's body is not found, she is presumed dead. Reese, Bianca and others soon find out about Greenlee being missing. Ryan tells Bianca that Zach and Reese have been engaging in a sexual relationship with each other. Bianca goes to Reese to tell her that their relationship and marriage is over. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle.|$|E

25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E

After Henry's new cover-up {{story is}} proved false, Henry finally {{admits that he}} is indeed an Other, but says he would be killed if he talks. Later, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) confronts the prisoner, demanding <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> let himself be caught, thinking {{it might have been}} to find the Swan. [...] "Henry", however, calls the hatch a [...] "joke", saying that during the lockdown, he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button; he simply stood there, and watched the timer's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own. Locke, however, replies angrily that Henry is lying, but he replies that he's [...] "done lying".|$|E
500|$|Madonna's manager Guy Oseary had {{contacted}} Martin Solveig wanting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{would be available}} to work with the singer, to which he responded affirmative. In July 2011, the singer invited Solveig for a writing session in London for her twelfth studio album, MDNA. This session produced three songs, including [...] "I Don't Give A", [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] and [...] "Turn Up the Radio", the last two later becoming official singles off the album. According to the producer, few days after he had finished the composition, Madonna completed writing the lyrics of [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] Solveig understood that the lyrics were probable references towards Madonna's life and thus received coverage in the press. However, he was not aware of the inner meaning behind the lyrics. With Billboard magazine, the producer further explained: ...|$|E

50|$|Oscar Villalobos, {{a former}} {{corporate}} lawyer {{who now works}} as a flunkie for a local news crew, was also shocked by what he saw in the durriken’s small black eyes. He, too, is determined to get another look. <b>He</b> needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> what <b>he</b> saw was real or imagined. <b>He</b> needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the durriken really did look deep into his past and dredge up emotions that were best left untouched.|$|R
500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, viewers saw Martha {{coming to}} terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be {{involved}} and he wants to say it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says he needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it. Martha's so scared of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} with 1999's Guerrilla, which featured songs with [...] "self-consciously disposable, happy" [...] lyrics, the tracks on Rings Around the World are, according to Rhys, [...] "broodier and more revealing". The track [...] "No Sympathy" [...] was originally written {{for a film}} entitled Plop, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week {{as though it were}} their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. [...] "Presidential Suite", about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, is [...] "a reflective look back at the decadent nineties" [...] during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if [...] "we need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really came inside her mouth?". [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] addresses social injustice and is about [...] "house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich" [...] and has been described by Rhys as [...] "grotesque in its upness and lift". [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable" [...] is about simultaneously being in awe of, and being hurt by, a [...] "girl around town" [...] while [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic song about growing old". [...] "Run! Christian, Run!" [...] was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford's interest in [...] "doomsday cult websites". Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band's American tours. The album's title track, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", is based on an idea put forward by Rhy's girlfriend's father and is about [...] "all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around". [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film—"a very cinematic reference" [...] for a song which Rhys claims is [...] "over-the-top lyrically". The track is about [...] "how people change" [...] and also references Labour Party 'spin doctor' Peter Mandelson, in the guise of 'Victor Panache'.|$|E

2500|$|World War I {{brought a}} crisis in his development. Military service {{disrupted}} his life when {{at the age of}} 42 he was in the army.

On one occasion, a superior officer demanded <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "this notorious Schoenberg, then"; Schoenberg replied: [...] "Beg to report, sir, yes.

2500|$|While testifying at the Guantanamo {{military}} commission for alleged child soldier Omar Khadr, FBI agent Robert Fuller testified that Khadr had identified Maher Arar {{as among the}} al-Qaeda militants he met while in Afghanistan. On October 7, 2002, Fuller went to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and showed Canadian teenager Omar Khadr a black-and-white photograph of Arar obtained from the FBI office in Massachusetts, and demanded <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> recognised him. Khadr initially stated {{that he did not}} recognise Arar. Upon cross-examination, Fuller clarified his testimony saying that at first Khadr could not identify Arar. Then after giving him a couple minutes Khadr [...] "stated he felt he had seen" [...] Maher Arar at a Kabul safehouse run by Abu Musab al-Suri or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The validity of Omar Khadr's possible sighting has been seriously questioned due to the time frame of the alleged sighting which was sometime during September or October 2001. Arar was known to be in North America during this time frame and under surveillance by the RCMP. Khadr's lawyer told Canadian media that Khadr, claiming to be under torture at Bagram Theater Internment Facility, simply told his captors whatever he thought they wanted to hear. Lawyers and advocates familiar with the case immediately dismissed the allegations.|$|E
2500|$|Hagel faced sharp {{questioning}} from Republicans. Senator John McCain berated him {{for refusing}} to give {{a yes or no}} {{answer to the question of}} whether the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was a success. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina demanded he [...] "name one dumb thing we've been goaded into doing because of the pressure from the Israeli or Jewish lobby." [...] Hagel stated [...] "I've already said I regret referencing the Jewish lobby, I should have said, 'pro-Israel lobby. ... The use of 'intimidation'—I should have used 'influence.' I think that would have been more appropriate. I should not have said 'dumb' or 'stupid,' because I understand or appreciate there are other views on these things.". Senator Ted Cruz played video excerpts from a 2009 Al Jazeera interview, and asserted that Hagel had agreed with a caller who suggested that Israel had committed war crimes. Hagel denied he agreed with that view. After the hearing, Senator Cruz organized a letter from 25 Republican Senators saying they would not vote until Hagel gave them copies of speeches given to organizations and told them the amount he was paid and whether the organizations received money from foreign sources. Lindsey Graham said they wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> spoke for any [...] "anti-Israel" [...] groups. Senate Committee chair Carl Levin said the demands were unprecedented, asking [...] "for information no prior nominee has been asked for," [...] and expressed confidence Hagel would be approved by the Senate.|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{not known}} {{precisely}} by whom gunpowder was invented, most historians agree that gunpowder's origins were in China by virtue of archaeological evidence and historical documents predating others by centuries, even if some professional military historians know little or nothing else about this early history of gunpowder warfare. The very earliest possible reference to gunpowder appeared in 142 AD during the Eastern Han dynasty, when the alchemist Wei Boyang wrote about a substance with the properties of gunpowder, and described a mixture of three powders that would [...] "fly and dance" [...] violently in his Cantong qi, otherwise known as the Book of the Kinship of Three, a Taoist text on the subject of alchemy. Although it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was actually referring to gunpowder, no other explosive known to scientists is composed of three powders. While it was almost certainly not their intention to create a weapon of war, Taoist alchemists would continue {{to play a major role}} in the invention of gunpowder due to their experiments on sulfur and saltpeter in the search for the secrets of eternal life and ways to transmute one material into another. Historian Peter Lorge notes that despite the early association of gunpowder with Taoism, this may be a quirk of historiography, and a result of the better preservation of texts associated with Taoism rather than being a point of interest limited to only Taoists. The Taoist quest for the elixir of life attracted many powerful patrons, one of whom was Emperor Wu of Han, and one of the resulting alchemical experiments involved heating 10% sulfur and 75% saltpeter to transform them.|$|E
