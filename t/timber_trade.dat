25|$|The Western Reclamation was {{progressively}} {{constructed by}} the Auckland Harbour Board, of which Ports of Auckland is the successor. The last components of the reclamation (Wynyard Wharf) were being completed in 1930 and provided the growing harbour with additional berthage capacity and increased land for port activities.

25|$|For much of {{the eighteenth}} century, Britain had {{encouraged}} the <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> with the New England colonies. The American stands of timber were primarily located along the small, but easily navigable rivers of New York and Massachusetts. These were fairly quickly exhausted.

25|$|Adding to her {{significance}} as an emigrant ship, City of Adelaide is {{the last}} survivor of the <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> between North America and the United Kingdom.

25|$|The French were {{interested}} in exploiting the land through the fur trade {{as well as the}} <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> later on.

They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|Economically, the city's port {{supported}} foreign trade, historically doing significant {{trade in}} the Low Countries, particularly with Bruges in Belgium and Veere in the Netherlands. In the 16th century {{there were so many}} Scots in Danzig in Prussia that they had their own church congregation and trade is mentioned with that city in Stirling Council's minutes of 1560. Around John Cowane's time there is an account which states there were about 30,000 Scots families living in Poland although that was possibly an exaggeration. Trade with the Baltic also took place such as a <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> with Norway.|$|E

25|$|The {{site has}} been {{occupied}} since the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods (pot burials), with cist tombs from ca. 2400 BC (Early Bronze Age). The city is mentioned in documents {{found in the}} Ebla archives of the 3rd millennium BC. According to documents from the archives of Mari and Alalakh, dated from c. 1800 BC, Carchemish was then ruled by a king named Aplahanda and was an important center of <b>timber</b> <b>trade.</b> It had treaty relationships with Ugarit and Mitanni (Hanilgalbat). In ancient times, the city commanded the main ford in the region across the Euphrates, a situation which must have contributed greatly to its historical and strategic importance.|$|E
25|$|An {{economic}} boom and {{growth in the}} years after their arrival allowed many Irish men to obtain steady employment on the rapidly expanding railroad network, settlements developed or expanded along or close to the Grand Trunk Railroad corridor often in rural areas, allowing many to farm the relatively cheap, arable land of southern Ontario. Employment opportunities in the cities, in Toronto but elsewhere, occupations included construction, liquor processing (see Distillery District), Great Lakes shipping, and manufacturing. Women generally entered into domestic service. In more remote areas, employment centred around the Ottawa Valley <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> which eventually extending into Northern Ontario along with railroad building and mining. There was a strong Irish rural presence in Ontario in comparison to their brethren in the northern US, but they were also numerous in the towns and cities. Later generations of these poorer immigrants were among those who rose to prominence in unions, business, judiciary, the arts and politics.|$|E
25|$|Despite the region's {{absence of}} {{economic}} growth on the same scale as {{other parts of the}} nation, the Maritimes has changed markedly throughout the 20th century, {{partly as a result of}} global and national economic trends, and partly as a result of government intervention. Each sub-region within the Maritimes has developed over time to exploit different resources and expertise. Saint John became a centre of the <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> and shipbuilding and is currently a centre for oil refining and some manufacturing. The northern New Brunswick communities of Edmundston, Campbellton, Dalhousie, Bathurst, and Miramichi are focused on the pulp and paper industry and some mining activity. Moncton was a centre for railways and has changed its focus to becoming a multi-modal transportation centre with associated manufacturing and retail interests. The Halifax metropolitan area has come to dominate peninsular Nova Scotia as a retail and service centre, but that province's industries were spread out from the coal and steel industries of industrial Cape Breton and Pictou counties, the mixed farming of the North Shore and Annapolis Valley, and the fishing industry was primarily focused on the South Shore and Eastern Shore. Prince Edward Island is largely dominated by farming, fishing, and tourism.|$|E

2500|$|To aid {{settlement}} and the <b>timber</b> <b>trade,</b> {{the nineteenth century}} saw a spree of canal building projects across the region. [...] Canals could not only bypass rapids and falls, but they could connect previously unlinked parts of the river system. [...] They also made transport of goods far easier and safer. [...] Canals were created for the <b>timber</b> <b>trade,</b> the transport of wheat, and also for military reasons.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> did {{not only}} bring {{immigrants}} to British North America, it {{also played a}} very important role in keeping them there as well. [...] While many of those disembarking from the timber ships would head south to the United States, many others would stay in British North America. [...] In large part, this was because of the employment that could be found in the <b>timber</b> <b>trade.</b> [...] At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the Gatineau region alone. [...] This when it had been only a few years before that the population of Montreal was only ten thousand. Similar situations could be found in the other centres of the <b>timber</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E
40|$|Informal and {{regional}} <b>timber</b> <b>trades</b> are commonly understood and primarily viewed as domestic trade. The {{development of these}} informal {{and regional}} trades is not only fueled by {{factors such as the}} dynamics of economic growth and local livelihoods, and the globalisation and increasing interdependence of economies, but also the weakening of the states, and institutions in the less developed countries. There are increasing indications and analyses, showing the growth and the extent of the informal trades beyond national borders, either for chainsaw milled (primary) or processed timbers. Regional informal <b>timber</b> <b>trades</b> in Asia (Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and South China) and in Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Sudan and Ghana) are becoming abundant reflecting similar developments as in agricultural products.
