5|$|The ostrich is a flightless bird {{native to}} Africa. It {{is the largest}} living species of bird. It is {{distinctive}} in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> high speeds.|$|E
5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases {{the capacity of the}} branch line from four to eight trains per hour. The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to allow more services <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E

5|$|Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, {{mastered}} the single <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> a faster speed than the album track, {{in order to}} make the song sound brighter on the radio. Unusually for an Apple release by a former Beatle, the single was packaged in a plain sleeve in the main markets of Britain and the United States. A variety of picture sleeves were available in European countries, including a design incorporating Harrison's signature and a red Om symbol, both of which were aspects of Tom Wilkes's artwork for the Material World album.|$|E
5|$|Invites to Golden League meets never materialised, but he {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> smaller events. He ran a European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m races at the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers by surprise {{and he said that}} limited opportunities to race had made him complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} daily ridership of {{the whole}} network of all phases, ater the compleiton of Phase-II, is 4 million passengers. The communication based train control (CBTC) is being used which enables trains <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> a short headway of 90 seconds. Keeping this in mind and other constraints, DMRC changed its decision to build 9-car-long stations for new lines and instead opting for shorter stations which can accommodate 6-car trains.|$|E

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese Grand Prix on 8 October, {{three teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions around European race tracks between 10–13 October {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Grand Prix. Ferrari opted to spend the four days with test driver Luca Badoer where he tested new mechanical components on the F1-2000 car at the Fiorano Circuit on a wet/dry track. He later moved to the Mugello Circuit where he tried out brake testing, car set-ups, tyre evaluation, endurance runs for the car's engines and continued trying out new car components. Benetton cancelled a test in Barcelona during the period and decided <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the Silverstone Circuit one week later using new Supertec engines angled at 110° degrees.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} WMATA's {{internal}} route designations, the Blue Line service travels along {{the entirety of}} the J Route (from the terminus at Franconia-Springfield to the C & J junction just south of King Street), part of the C Route (from the C & J junction just south of King Street to Metro Center), part of the D Route (from Metro Center to the D & G Junction just east of Stadium-Armory) and the entire G Route (from the D & G junction past Stadium-Armory to the terminus at Largo Town Center). The Blue Line needs 23 six-car trains (138 rail cars) <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> peak capacity.|$|E
5|$|Leipzig and Nürnberg {{were the}} {{follow-on}} class {{to the three}} Königsberg-class ships. They were built to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed the diesel and turbine engines <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the same speed of the earlier ships. They were also fitted with bulbous bows to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency. The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the Königsbergs, while Nürnberg was built with a much larger structure. Nürnberg was also completed with a much stronger anti-aircraft battery.|$|E
5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest and the train <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E

5|$|On 3 May, the FIA {{called a}} meeting {{at the request of the}} Italian Automobile Club to review the events of the Weekend. Later on, the {{governing}} body announced new safety measures for the next round in Monaco which included the entry and exit of the pitlane to be controlled by a curve to force cars <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> a reduced speed, no team mechanic would be allowed onto the pit lane surface except for pit stops and a draw would be arranged to determine the order in which cars make pit stops and be limited to emergencies with cars not taking on new tyres or allowed to refuel.|$|E
5|$|The 1894 Championship {{began with}} a loss for the {{defending}} champions against England, during {{a game in which}} Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so it would get to the backs quickly and allow them <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all his might into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of Jim Hannan, who was trying to follow his captain's wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by Dai Fitzgerald in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by Jack Elliott from Cardiff RFC.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E
