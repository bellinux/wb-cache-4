25|$|In 1980 the Toros began a long {{association}} with the Houston Astros. Following {{the lead of the}} parent club (which was widely criticized for its 1980s uniforms), the Toros introduced what some consider the ugliest uniform in the history of organized baseball: orange pants with yellow and red stripes, and a jersey with a turquoise back, yellow raglan sleeves, and a front resplendent in yellow, avocado, red, orange, and lime green stripes of various widths. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> 1981, an all-orange uniform with red and yellow trim, was similarly ill-received.|$|E
500|$|For research, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited {{museums and}} art galleries, and also read Austen's letters and novels. She was {{interested}} in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes. While she recognised that 1795 [...] "marked the beginning" [...] of the empire waistline trend, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the early 1790s. She explained, [...] "We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> London {{is very different from}} <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{released}} on December 13, 2013 through the iTunes Store, {{in addition to a}} clip for every other track on the parent album. On November 24, 2014 the clip was also uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. A behind-the-scenes video was also released online on December 2, 2014, featuring commentary by director Åkerlund. The concept behind the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] revolves around Beyoncé leading a revolution. The video begins with quick shots of a desolate parking lot. Beyoncé then appears with a balaclava which she uses to cover her face up to the eyes. She is seen walking slowly towards the camera, as other people start joining her with flags and bats in their hands. Later in the video, she takes the mask off and the people surrounding her set [...] various objects on fire using Molotov cocktails, write graffiti on walls, and break a car. Beyoncé is later seen holding a man with a mask who is laying on the ground. The end of the video sees the protesting group facing a line of SWAT policemen. They start running towards them and as the video comes to its end Beyoncé holds hands with the person next to her which is the same man she hugged {{on the ground in the}} previous scene. For <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the video, she donned a cropped T-shirt, pants designed by Åkerlund, a green scarf by Michael Schmidt, shoes by Rodarte and rings by Lynn Ban.|$|E

2500|$|In 1841, {{he praised}} the establishment, in London, of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, {{and also the}} Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer {{even went so far}} as to protest against the use of the pronoun [...] "it" [...] in {{reference}} to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things. To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.|$|E
2500|$|Marat is in {{the bathtub}} to which his {{debilitating}} skin condition confines him. He who wanted to cure the world is beaten by his own illness. Charlotte knocks at the door. Marat's housekeeper asks {{her to come back}} an other time but he demands that she be let in. They remain alone together. Charlotte has brought a list of [...] "enemies of the Revolution" [...] for him to examine. He reads his own name at the top and asks for an explanation. They start an argument about power, loneliness, truth, and death, which ends up with her stabbing him to death. At the instant in which the blade descends upon him Marat understands the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> Charlotte's eyes and dies without knowing her name.|$|E
2500|$|Communication is pivotal in {{the role}} of entrepreneurship, because it enables leaders to {{convince}} potential investors, partners and employees about the feasibility of a venture. Entrepreneurs need to communicate effectively to shareholders. Nonverbal elements in speech such as the tone of voice, <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the sender's eyes, body language, hand gestures, and state of emotions are also important communication tools. The Communication Accommodation Theory posits that throughout communication, people will attempt to accommodate or adjust their method of speaking to others. [...] Face Negotiation Theory describes how people from different cultures manage conflict negotiation in order to maintain [...] "face". Hugh Rank's [...] "intensify and downplay" [...] communications model can be used by entrepreneurs who are developing a new product or service. Rank argues that entrepreneurs {{need to be able to}} intensify the advantages of their new product or service and downplay the disadvantages, in order to persuade others to support their venture.|$|E

2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, [...] "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement from the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a heart attack. Kathy later said, [...] "I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Toronto Blue Jays {{change from}} their {{traditional}} blue and grey jersey to a red alternate jersey every Canada Day (July 1) to help celebrate the national holiday (and with it, a cap {{with a red}} maple leaf on it, which is Canada's national symbol). In 2007, the Jays announced {{that as part of}} the team's popular [...] "Flashback Friday" [...] promotion, the team would use replica uniforms based on the powder-blue road uniforms used in the 1980s at all Friday night home games, starting with the 2008 season. To complete the look, the Jays also wore the original blue and white caps, with their traditional logo {{on the front of the}} uniform as well as on the caps. In 2017, to celebrate Canada's 150th anniversary, the Blue Jays will wear alternate red jerseys and caps for every Sunday home game. The Tampa Bay Rays wore a black alternate from 1998–2000 when they were the Devil Rays, and from 2005–07 they wore green alternate jersey worn both at home and away on selected games. When they changed their name to the Rays, they introduced an alternate navy blue for home and away games to go along with their white and gray uniforms. In 2010 they added light blue jerseys to be worn only on Sunday home games. The Cincinnati Reds wear a red alternate at many afternoon home games, and the Atlanta Braves wear a red jersey for every home game played on Sunday, while the Washington Nationals wear red for all weekend home games, and in 2011 have done so for most weekend road games as well. The Pittsburgh Pirates wore a red alternate for every home game played on Friday during the 2007 season, even though red is not an official team color. Since , the Boston Red Sox wore a red alternate jersey for Friday night home games and a blue alternate jersey for Friday night away games. Also since 2008, for every afternoon home game, the Kansas City Royals wear powder-blue jerseys almost reminiscent of the old jerseys they wore in the 1980s (and in 2010 introduced new powder-blue caps to be worn with these jerseys, though they have since gone back to wearing their normal blue caps). The San Francisco Giants wear orange jerseys during all Friday home games. The Philadelphia Phillies introduced an alternate cream-colored uniform (with a blue cap to complete <b>the</b> <b>look)</b> <b>in</b> 2008 and currently wear it for all afternoon home games. Most recently the Mariners revived their teal jerseys from the mid-1990s, to be used on Friday and Monday home games. In 2015 they also introduced an alternate version of their home uniforms, using the team's classic blue-and-yellow scheme on cream uniforms, to be worn on Sunday home games. The Baltimore Orioles wear alternate black jerseys (with a cap showing the [...] "O's" [...] script logo) every Friday, regardless of whether they are home or away (home games against the Red Sox would force the latter to wear their regular grey uniforms rather than their navy Friday uniforms), and in 2012 they introduced an alternate orange jersey to be worn during Saturday games. In 2013, the New York Mets introduced two different blue alternate jerseys; one has their team name on it (in orange lettering) and is used at home, while the other has their city name on it (in gray lettering) and is used on the road. Prior to that, the Mets wore two black alternate jerseys in a similar fashion as their current blue alternates.|$|E
