Additionally, return of the sovereignty right <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> along with withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq was another one of the main issues on the agenda.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, Omaar has {{expressed}} regret {{about the way}} in which he covered the invasion of Iraq during his time as a BBC correspondent. He suggested that he and his colleagues did pieces on Sadam Hussein, his regime and weapons inspectors, giving little coverage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people.</b> Interviewed in John Pilger's documentary The War You Don't See (2010), Omaar also lamented that [...] "one didn't press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough" [...] and called the coverage [...] "a giant echo chamber".|$|E
2500|$|According to General Tommy Franks, the {{objectives}} of the invasion were, [...] "First, end the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to search for, to capture and to drive out terrorists from that country. Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. Seventh, to secure Iraq's oil fields and resources, which belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people.</b> And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{suicide bombing}} of the United Nations in Baghdad drew {{overwhelming}} condemnation. Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General, commented that the bombing would not stop <b>the</b> organization's efforts <b>to</b> rebuild Iraq, and said: [...] "Nothing can excuse this act of unprovoked and murderous violence against {{men and women who}} went to Iraq for one purpose only: <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> recover their independence and sovereignty, and to rebuild their country as fast as possible, under leaders of their own choosing." ...|$|R
2500|$|In September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in {{an answer}} to a {{parliamentary}} question, that [...] "Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing.

[...] In November of that year, Blair further stated that, [...] "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not régime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> ... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, {{but on the other hand}} I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change." ...|$|E

[...] As the third quarter closed, Huckabee was reported to have missed a major GOP conference in Michigan because his campaign could not afford a charter flight. Huckabee rebounded his finances before the end of the third quarter, however, reporting $651,301 on hand.

50|$|In mid-October 2003 {{operations}} to prevent infiltrations into Iraq were continuing. Operation Chamberlain is designed <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> with {{a stable and}} secure border {{in order to maintain}} territorial integrity. In this vein, coalition forces recently intercepted smugglers trying <b>to</b> cross <b>the</b> border southwest of Sinjar. As coalition forces approached the group, the smugglers opened fire on coalition forces. While some of the smugglers escaped, several of them were detained, and in the operation, coalition forces seized weapons and a pickup truck. Other border operations have resulted in the detention of similar individuals trying to illegally cross into Iraq with weapons and money. By the end of October 2003 commanders of the US forces monitoring the border between Iraq and Syria said there was no evidence from human intelligence sources or radar surveillance aircraft indicating that significant numbers of foreign fighters were crossing into Iraq.|$|R

Later, Sistani called for a democratic vote of the people {{for the purpose of}} forming a transitional government. Observers described the move as being a path leading directly to Shia political dominance over Iraq's government, as Shia Muslims make up approximately 60% of <b>the</b> total <b>Iraqi</b> population. Subsequently, Sistani criticized plans for an Iraqi government for not being democratic enough.|$|R
50|$|The US invaded Iraq {{in order}} to take down Saddam Hussein's regime and {{dissolve}} any threats of weapons of mass destruction. After the fall of the regime, the United States government, with the help of ethnic leaders had to confront three issues: the nature of <b>the</b> future <b>Iraqi</b> government, how Shia representation was to be achieved in the government, and how Sunni re-enfranchisement was to be managed. Different opinions emerged on whether <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government should be centralized or not, how the US should respond to civil conflict between the Arabs and Kurds, and how previous promises <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kurdish and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> would be achieved in a future state.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis is <b>to</b> {{investigate}} <b>the</b> way George W. Bush used moral metaphors <b>to</b> intensify <b>the</b> language in his statements on Operation Iraqi Freedom. Three moral metaphors are presented within two different models that are applied on the data. The collected material for the metaphors is constituted of cognitive linguistic books from prominent linguists, such as George Lakoff, Alan Cruse and William Croft, and the data is collected from the official White House website. The scientific method {{used in this study}} has been qualitative text analysis where the hermeneutic approach has been an essential part of it. The main question: In what way did George W. Bush use moral metaphors in his statements to justify Operation Iraqi Freedom?, resulted in use of moral metaphors that sermons people’s moral values, depict Saddam Hussein’s characteristics as immoral, activate people’s moral priorities <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people,</b> and addresses both conservatives and liberals in America. The conclusion of my study is that President Bush deliberately intensified the language in his statements through moral metaphors to justify Operation Iraqi Freedom.

What was your main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> a voice. [...] For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country."

S. {{military}} intervention in Iraq – A study of how the intervention corresponds with the UN Charter Authors: Andreas Malmgren & Johan Schneider Supervisor: Lennart Bergfeldt Date: 2006 - 09 - 26 The aim of this essay is through a qualitative literature study examine the main arguments of <b>the</b> Bush administration <b>to</b> justify a {{military intervention}} in Iraq. <b>The</b> theories used <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> actions of the U. S. are system level analysis, hegemonism and realism while the UN Charter will be applied as a normative theory. The research questions are: ■ What were the main arguments of the Bush administration for a {{military intervention in}} Iraq? ■ How do these arguments correspond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UN Charter? U. S. claimed that Iraq was manufacturing nuclear weapons and this was threatening {{the security of the}} U. S. The administration also wanted <b>to</b> liberate <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> from <b>the</b> dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. When the U. S. could not get support through the UN they decided to act independently. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UN Charter, UN or its member states are not allowed to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any state neither is it allowed to act with a pre-emptive purpose. An exceptional clausal exists if the Security Council decides it is a threat to peace or peace crimes. If a state act without the UN mandate this could undermine the UN authority.
