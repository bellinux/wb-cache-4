This research predicted the waste quantity generated in households and in industrial facilities in Turkey via surveys, factory research and official databases.

40|$|Post-consumer {{textile product}} {{is one of}} the rapid {{expanding}} markets in the world. Various kinds of textile goods are generated in every season to meet consumer demand and trends. With such a high level of consumption, it is very likely that more unwanted domestic textiles will be produced. Without proper textile waste management, the unwanted textiles will eventually end up in landfills and incinerators becoming <b>textile</b> <b>wastes.</b> Overseas countries put a lot of effort in facilitating textile waste management. Their commercial recyclers, NGOs and government have implemented different programmes to promote textile waste management in their communities. Although Hong Kong government and NGOs have also implemented some schemes to deal with the domestic textile waste problem, the effectiveness of the schemes are in doubt. Over the last decade, most of the textile waste in Hong Kong is sent to the landfills, causing environmental problems and exerting a huge spatial pressure on the landfills. Nevertheless, most of the <b>textile</b> <b>wastes</b> which are recovered are being sent overseas which is very likely to be developing countries for recycling, leading to a diverted textile waste problem. In addition, since there are no policy and regulations on dealing with <b>textile</b> <b>wastes,</b> {{there is a lack of}} incentive for the recyclers to treat <b>textile</b> <b>wastes</b> properly. Therefore, it is essential to raise the public’s awareness towards the textile waste problem and textile waste management programmes, as well as to provide sufficient supporting measures to facilitate effective textile waste management in Hong Kong. There is a lack of study about domestic textile waste management in Hong Kong, including the public’s behaviour and attitude towards textile waste management. This dissertation fills this knowledge gap. The result of this study shows that there is a value action gap among Hong Kong citizens. Besides, insufficient public awareness towards textile waste management, inconvenience of textile waste collection network, the lack of textile waste management and recycling facilities, the lack of policy support and initiatives, inadequate monitoring of the textile waste management programmes, and the lack of effective green education also contribute to the poor effectiveness and efficiency of textile waste management in Hong Kong. Based on these findings, recommendations are then made. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E

More information about {{consumer attitude}} and behaviour toward <b>textile</b> and <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> is needed to provide suitable waste management processes according to the hierarchy of waste management, such as re-use and energy recovery, and to ensure sustainable development and minimal impact on the worlds wellbeing.

30|$|The {{cellulose}} conversion using alkali ultrasonication on CGT (40 %) {{was larger}} than the conversion found by Silverstein et al. [6] in cotton stalks (21 %) but it was lower than Kaur et al. [15] over cotton stalks (63 %) and Jeihanipour and Taherzadeh [14] in textiles wastes (99 %). The difference between CGT and <b>textile</b> <b>wastes</b> is associated with their composition. <b>Textile</b> <b>wastes</b> comprise small lignin content which allows an {{easy access to the}} cellulose. Alkali hydrolysis has been utilized in several types of biomass (sugarcane bagasse, sweet sorghum bagasse, corn stover, etc.) to reduce the lignin content [16]. This pretreatment is normally related with the removal of lignin because NaOH breaks the ester bonds cross-linkage in lignin and xylan [9]. This breaking augments the biomass porosity allowing an easier access of the enzymes to the cellulose. However, alkali hydrolysis normally does not produce considerable modification in the cellulose structure, and this type of modification is necessary to increase the cellulose conversion [6]. The combination of alkaline pretreatment and ultrasonication have been evaluated in sugarcane bagasse and rice straw. In sugarcane, alkali ultrasonication boosted the cellulose conversion approximately 50 % against the un-pretreated biomass and 40 % versus the pretreatment without ultrasonication [17]. The difference between the pretreated and un-pretreated biomass coincides with the results of this research (Figure 1). In rice straw, the alkali ultrasonication exhibited cellulose conversion greater than the un-pretreated biomass and the alkali pretreatment; nevertheless, the difference between the alkali pretreatment and the alkali ultrasonication was small [18]. The cellulose conversion can be enhanced by different strategies such optimizing the severity of the liquid hot water pretreatment or improving the conditions of the ligninolytic enzymes and ultrasonication pretreatment (reaction time, temperatures, etc.).|$|E

30|$|An {{alternative}} development concept is to aim to use environmentally friendly products. One aspect of being environmentally friendly is effective utilization of unused resources. Using agricultural wastes, forest product wastes, <b>textile</b> <b>wastes,</b> and so on, as {{the raw materials}} of thermal insulation products is favorable for working towards a sustainable society based on resource recycling. For instance, Binici et al. [3] investigated the k-value of fiber mats made of sunflower stalks, Zhou et al. [4] reported a k-value for binderless cotton stalk fiberboards, and Yamauchi et al. [5] published a k-value for thick insulation panels made from sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) bark and used as a floor heating base material. The k-values of these insulation materials range from 0.050 to 0.073  W/(mK) because their density is more than 150  kg/m 3. Although these k-values are greater than (i.e., inferior to) that of the glass wool commonly used in buildings, the materials are nevertheless fully usable, {{as long as a}} building has space to accommodate thick insulation materials. The other environmentally friendly aspect to consider is the energy consumption involved in production of the materials. Most thermal insulation materials require a heating process in their manufacturing line. Based on both of these aspects, cellulose fiber (CF) is an advantageous insulation material because it is made of waste newspapers and does not require a heating process.|$|E

The water swelling properties strongly decreased in the manufactured TetraPak composites when compared with the conventional particleboard panels. The fungal decay resistance tests revealed that the stand alone TetraPak based composites were not completely resistant to wood-decaying fungi. A significant amelioration in the decay durability was observed for the manufactured TetraPak composites compared to the standard wood samples. Durability classes were determined according to the criteria given in the European standard (CEN/TS 15083 - 1). Interestingly, the data indicated that the increment of the wool waste proportion in the produced boards lead to a significant enhancement counter the test fungi. The results of termite screening test showed further considerable resistance for whole TetraPak based composites against termites when compared to traditional wood samples.

According to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, textile consumption increased by 40 % between the years 2000 and 2009 in Sweden. Given that there is currently no textile recycling plant in Sweden, {{the aim of this}} article is to explore the potential environmental benefits of various textile recycling techniques and thereby direct <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management strategies toward more sustainable options. Three different recycling techniques for a model waste consisting of 50 % cotton and 50 % polyester were identified and a life cycle assessment (LCA) was made to assess the environmental performance of them. The recycling processes are: material reuse of <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> of adequate quality; separation of cellulose from polyester using N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide as a solvent; and chemical recycling of polyester. These are compared to incineration, representing conventional <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> treatment in Sweden.
