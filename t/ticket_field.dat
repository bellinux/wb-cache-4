25|$|Skyline Tickets: Located on {{each end}} of the upper level (along the third base line in section 422L, and above right field in section 437R), the Skyline seats were {{available}} for purchase for $1 each, and went on sale at the Turner <b>Field</b> <b>ticket</b> windows 2½ hours before gametime. There was a strict policy of one ticket per person, and entry to the stadium was required immediately after purchase, in an effort to prevent ticket scalping.|$|R
25|$|In 1912 {{another very}} {{short-lived}} name change was made, {{this time to}} Christian Patriots. This change was again quickly reversed and the party's ticket appeared on the November 1912 ballot under its old moniker. The party continued in existence but went on hiatus, failing to run a Presidential ticket in the elections of 1916, 1920, or 1924. While intimations were made that a Presidential <b>ticket</b> would be <b>fielded</b> in 1928, it seems that this plan came to naught and the party expired.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{suppliers}} generate invoices {{using an}} Excel or CSV template. They can put supporting documents, such as scanned <b>field</b> <b>tickets,</b> into a specific folder, or attach to a message via the b2een user interface.

This allows {{to speed up the}} processes and minimize errors in dealing with a large number of suppliers.|$|R

50|$|In July 2005, safety {{officials}} temporarily restricted Field Mill's {{capacity to}} 5,000 when fire safety certificates {{could not be}} located. The ground's capacity was again reduced in May 2007, from 9,368 to 4,684, when Nottinghamshire County Council, who enforced the reduction, cited a poor standard of stewarding {{and a lack of}} a pro-active approach to safety. In July 2007 the capacity was raised to 6,553 following an inspection from safety officials, but was reduced back to 4,684 in September after visiting Chesterfield supporters were given too many <b>tickets</b> by mistake. <b>Field</b> Mill's capacity was then increased to 5,457, and in January 2008 further increased to 7,300 for the FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough after a problem with the turnstiles and other issues were resolved.|$|R

Later that same year, Local H announced a contest in which fans could make videos of themselves covering Local H songs. The winner would then get to be the opening act for Local H's New Year's Eve show later that year. A band from New York called Kung-Fu Grip won the contest with their cover of a song from Local H's No Fun E.P.|$|R
6000|$|If {{there are}} two <b>tickets</b> in the <b>field</b> in his city, one {{composed}} of honest men and the other of notorious blatherskites and criminals, he will not hesitate to lay his private Christian honor aside and vote for the blatherskites if his [...] "party honor" [...] shall exact it. His Christianity is of no use to him and has no influence upon him when he is acting in a public capacity. He has sound and sturdy private morals, {{but he has no}} public ones. In the last great municipal election in New York, almost a complete one-half of the votes representing 3,500,000 Christians were cast for a ticket that had hardly a man on it whose earned and proper place was outside of a jail. But that vote was present at church next Sunday the same as ever, and as unconscious of its perfidy as if nothing had happened.|$|R
