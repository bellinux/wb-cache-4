5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors.</b> Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E

They continued along the southern shores to found Carthage in 814 BC in northern Africa, and from there to the Balearic Islands and the Iberian Peninsula. The Phoenicians were the founders of Málaga and Cádiz in present-day Spain sometime in the 9th century, though a small outpost may have been established even earlier.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the word}} of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying that God had made a {{covenant}} with the Israelites' forefathers when God brought them out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage that in the seventh year they must let every Hebrew slave go free, but their forefathers did not listen. The people had turned and done what is right in God's eyes, proclaiming liberty <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> making a covenant before God in the Temple. But the people turned again and profaned God's name, causing their servants whom they had freed to return to subjugation as servants once again. Therefore, God said that as the people had not listened to God to proclaim liberty <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> God would proclaim for the people liberty to the sword, pestilence, and famine, and would make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. God would give over to their enemies the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the officers, the priests, and all the people of the land who had transgressed God's covenant, who had sealed the covenant by cutting a calf in half and passing between the two parts of the calf, and their dead bodies would be food for scavengers. And God would give Zedekiah and his princes into the hand of the king of Babylon, who would return to burn Jerusalem and lay desolate the cities of Judah.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E

500|$|Hamurabi is a text-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} centered on resource management {{in which the}} player, identified in the text as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, enters numbers {{in response to questions}} posed by the game. The resources that the player must manage are people, acres of land, and bushels of grain. These are managed over the course of ten rounds, each of which represents a year. Each person can farm a set amount of land, which produces grain. Grain, in turn, can be used to feed people, who otherwise die the following round, or planted for the following year's crop. The player may also buy or sell land <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> each turn in exchange for grain. Each round begins with an adviser stating [...] "Hamurabi: I beg to report to you" [...] the current status of the city, including the prior year's harvest and change in population, followed by a series of questions as to how many bushels of grain to spend on land, seeds, and feeding the people.|$|E
500|$|Giant mouse lemurs use {{at least}} eight vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are contact calls, which sound like [...] "hum" [...] or a [...] "hein" [...] and are used when moving and when meeting {{familiar}} individuals. A [...] "mother-infant meeting call" [...] used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like [...] "pfiou" [...] and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a [...] "croak", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated [...] "tisk-tisk-tisk" [...] sounds. Females exhibit a [...] "waking call sequence", sometimes referred to as [...] "loud calls", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter [...] "hon" [...] calls possibly to indicate their position <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors.</b> A long [...] "sexual call sequence" [...] consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse [...] "brroak" [...] calls is used by both sexes during estrus. Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined. The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species. Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication, they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland on small branches and other objects.|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} by F. W. Mote concluded {{that at the}} time of the Liao dynasty's fall, [...] "the Liao state remained strong, capable of functioning at reasonable levels and possessing greater resources of war than any of its enemies" [...] and that [...] "one cannot find signs of serious economic or fiscal breakdown that might have impoverished or crippled its ability to respond". Mote also concluded that acculturation did not lead to the replacement of traditional Khitan values with Chinese culture, and that the Khitan commoners were [...] "supremely able and willing to fight", which Mote pointed to as evidence that Khitan society remained strong. Mote instead attributes the fall of the Liao to the leadership ability of Aguda and to the actions of the Khitan Yelü and Xiao clans, which used early defeats at the hand of Aguda as a pretext for plotting the overthrow of Emperor Tianzuo. Historian Jacques Gernet disagrees with Mote, writing that [...] "by the middle of the eleventh century the Khitan had lost their combative spirit and adopted a defensive attitude <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> building walls, ramparts for their towns, and fortified posts." [...] Gernet attributes this change to the influence of Buddhism, which abhors violence, as well as to Chinese wealth and culture in general. Like Mote, Gernet attributes the ultimate downfall of the Liao to the interference by the ruling clans, and he additionally credits a series of droughts and floods, as well as attacks by the Jurchen tribes on the north-east edge of Liao territory, with weakening the Liao to a critical level.|$|E
