One of the seemingly most promising methods used trajectory probability as a criterion, so that higher probability trajectories were preferentially continued, resulting in a more even distribution of (surviving) trajectory probabilities, and better than stochastic approximation to a reference outcome. It was also found that this management technique introduced a failed ergodicity assumption. The higher and lower probability trajectories behave differently to a significant extent. The effect is {{to limit the number of}} trajectories which can usefully be applied to the problem, such that additional runs would fail to converge further toward the definitive reference outcome set.

40|$|In {{the present}} ATC system {{conflicts}} between aircraft are detected and resolved in a stated-based approach. To meet traffic demand predictions, the global {{air traffic management}} (ATM) system needs revolutionary changes. Several visions on future ATM operations exist (e. g. NextGen, SESAR). A common function between the different visions is 4 D <b>Trajectory</b> <b>management.</b> This function enables trajectory-based operation {{as opposed to the}} state-based approach of the present system. Instead of monitoring the current traffic situation and resolving short term conflicts by vectoring, the 4 D <b>trajectory</b> <b>management</b> function de-conflicts all trajectories prior to execution. A key function of 4 D <b>trajectory</b> <b>management</b> is the resolution of 4 D trajectories. Conflict resolution of 4 D trajectories is applied to conflict scenarios using constraints. A characteristic of a constraint {{is that it does not}} limit the aircraft to a particular solution but provides the aircraft the room to generate a trajectory within the actual solution space. Conflicting trajectories are resolved using constraints where the constraints provides an approximation of the solution space.

40|$|The {{promise of}} the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is {{strongly}} tied {{to the concept of}} trajectory-based operations in the national airspace system. Existing efforts to develop <b>trajectory</b> <b>management</b> concepts are largely focused on individual trajectories, optimized independently, then de-conflicted among each other, and individually re-optimized, as possible. The benefits in capacity, fuel, and time are valuable, though perhaps could be greater through alternative strategies. The concept of agent-based trajectories offers a strategy for automation of simultaneous multiple <b>trajectory</b> <b>management.</b> The anticipated result of the strategy would be dynamic management of multiple trajectories with interacting and interdependent outcomes that satisfy multiple, conflicting constraints. These constraints would include the business case for operators, the capacity case for the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP), and the environmental case for noise and emissions. The benefits in capacity, fuel, and time might be improved over those possible under individual <b>trajectory</b> <b>management</b> approaches. The proposed approach relies on computational agent-based modeling (ABM), combinatorial mathematics, as well as application of "traffic physics" concepts to the challenge, and modeling and simulation capabilities. The proposed strategy could support transforming air traffic control from managing individual aircraft behaviors to managing systemic behavior of air traffic in the NAS. A system built on the approach could provide the ability to know when regions of airspace approach being "full," that is, having non-viable local solution space for optimizing trajectories in advance...|$|E
40|$|Air traffic {{will grow}} {{significantly}} in the future, {{as a consequence of}} increasing globalization. To cope with additional traffic, both in the air and on the ground, stakeholders look to new Air Traffic Management procedures unburden the system, and Trajectory-Based Operations are the key to accomplishing this goal. By sharing a detailed trajectory between all Air Traffic Management participants, Trajectory-Based Operations promise more precise planning to accommodate demand and optimize all aspects of air traffic flow. However, transitioning from current operations to Trajectory-Based Operations is most challenging when considering the transition phase of this implementation. Trajectory-Based Operations require new technologies, and the perceived investment required for those technologies may, at first, appear to be a hurdle - perhaps an impediment to doing so. This implementation can either be mandated through regulation or by budgeting for and limiting investment costs. The higher the equipage rate with <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Management</b> Systems, the higher will be the benefits realized through the use of Trajectory-Based Operations. This thesis provides a proof-of-concept for an onboard retrofit <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Management</b> System that enables a cost-efficient implementation resulting potentially in a high equipage rate. For this research, the <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Management</b> System is designed as decision support system for the pilot who is the chief decision maker onboard the aircraft. To support this proof-of-concept, this research involved a close analysis of the expected changes to the Air Traffic Management system with regard to Trajectory-Based Operations. Cognitive ergonomics were reviewed, determining the best integration of Trajectory-Based Operations into an Electronic Flight Bag charting application to support trajectory negotiation, monitoring, and guidance. The negotiation functionality would permit the exchange of trajectories between all on-ground and aboard-flight stakeholders. Trajectory monitoring would transform the temporal constraint of a waypoint into a longitudinal area along the planned route. Four guidance principles are considered that represent differing integrations of the temporal guidance into the aircraft control loops. Evaluations using flight simulator at TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT DARMSTADT, onboard the 2012 BOEING ecoDemonstrator, and the DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FÜR LUFT- UND RAUMFAHRT Advanced Technology Research Aircraft, demonstrated the general feasibility of the <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Management</b> System under real world conditions. In the simulator trials, the focus was on the usability of the system. The briefing and monitoring of a trajectory using the charting application was compared to integration into the aircraft Flight Management System. The ecoDemonstrator trials, focusing on an arrival integration of the trajectory, showed that the system is prone to communication failure, which led to an increased initial time deviation from the planned trajectory. In the German flight trials, the applicability of the <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Management</b> System was evaluated. Although the evaluated Trajectory Guidance functions have met the required accuracy, an integration is not recommended because of increased pilot workload. Instead the evaluating pilots found subjective benefits of a <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Management</b> System for the graphical Trajectory Negotiation and Monitoring, possibly with a bidirectional Flight Management System integration...|$|E
40|$|Mitigating {{anomalies}} {{are crucial}} for <b>trajectory</b> <b>management</b> in logistics and supply chain systems. Among variant devices for trace detection, computational {{radio frequency identification}} (CRFID) tags are promising to draw precise trajectory from the data reported by their accelerometers. However, full coverage of the processing flow using RFID readers is usually cost inefficient, sometimes impractical. In this paper, we propose to employ CRFID tags as tagging devices and develop a working system, Tracer, for precise trajectory detection. Instead of covering the entire processing area, Tracer only deploys RFID readers in essential regions to detect the mishandling, loss, and other abnormal states of items. We design a tree-indexed Markov chain framework, which leverages statistical methods to enable fine-grained and dynamic <b>trajectory</b> <b>management.</b> Results from a preliminarily deployment on a real baggage handling system and trace-driven simulations demonstrate that Tracer is effective to detect the anomalous events with low cost and high accuracy. © 2013 Rui Li et al...|$|E

Firstly, they can’t detect vehicles’ trajectory {{information that is}} necessary for building origin-destination (OD) matrix in traffic planning. Secondly, {{it is impossible to}} cover the whole road network with them with respect to economic reasons. Thirdly, their applicability and reliability are limited by design and external factors such as weather conditions. In view of these defects, a new approach that employs vehicles as mobile sensors to collect their trajectory data for traffic study is introduced. The recent development of positioning and communication technologies makes it possible to collect, transfer, and apply large trajectory data from moving vehicles, and as a result, a large number of trajectory data have been or will be available, which pushes the development of the mentioned approach.

Managing the locations and trajectories of numerous people, vehicles, vessels, commodities, and so forth must be efficient and robust, since this information must be processed online and should provide answers to users' requests in real time. In this geostreaming context, such long-running con¬tinuous queries must be repeatedly evaluated against the most recent positions relayed by moving objects, for instance, reporting which people are now moving in a specific area or finding friends closest to the current location of a mobile user. In essence, modern processing engines must cope with huge amounts of streaming, transient, uncertain, and heterogeneous spatiotemporal data, which can be characterized as big trajectory data. In this chapter, we examine Big Data processing techniques over frequently updated locations and trajectories of moving objects. Rapidly evolving tra¬jectory data pose several research challenges with regard to their acquisition, storage, indexing, analysis, discovery, and interpretation in order to be really useful for intel-ligent, cost-effective decision making. Indeed, the Big Data issues regarding volume, velocity, variety, and veracity also arise in this case. Thus, we foster a close synergy between the established stream processing paradigm and spatiotemporal properties inherent in motion features. Taking advantage of the spatial locality and tempo¬ral timeliness that characterize each trajectory, we present methods and heuristics from our recent research results that address such problems. We highlight certain aspects of big <b>trajectory</b> data <b>management</b> through several case studies. Regarding volume, we suggest single-pass algorithms that can summarize each object's course into succinct, reliable representations. To cope with velocity, an amnesic trajectory approximation structure may offer fast, multiresolution synopses by dropping details from obsolete segments. Detection of objects that travel together can lead to trajec¬tory multiplexing, hence reducing the variety inherent in raw positional data. As for veracity, we discuss a probabilistic method for continuous range monitoring against user locations with varying degrees of uncertainty, due to privacy concerns in geo¬social networking.
