5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|Arad's {{police force}} {{was chosen as}} the {{exceptional}} force for 2007, and awarded an award of excellence on 5 March 2008. Among others, a severe reduction in property crime was cited. Arad's force was able <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> such crimes from 1,092 in 2003 to just 168 in 2007. On 18 July 2008, Arad police, in a rare incident, shot dead a man threatening to kill his ex-wife with a knife.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{high voltage}} power cables as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out. Its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> environmentally hazardous waste. Lead {{is one of three}} metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials, helping detect organic acids, aldehydes, and acidic gases.|$|E

5|$|The Australian bush fly, Musca vetustissima, {{is a major}} {{nuisance}} pest in Australia, but native decomposers {{found in}} Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> physical jostling between runners {{in the early stages}} of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E

5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, {{is seen as an}} expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E
5|$|The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was {{originally}} {{scheduled to open}} on May 8, 2011, one week after that of Kings Island. On May 24, 2011, after problems were discovered during testing, Canada's Wonderland announced on their Facebook page that it would {{open to the public}} later that day, but it was quickly closed again when further mechanical problems were discovered. From May 24 to mid-June 2011, the ride was intermittently closed because of a variety of problems, most of which have since been resolved. At the beginning of October 2011, the hydraulic dampers used on the Knott's Berry Farm model were added <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> swing movement even more.|$|E

5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
5|$|The phase-amplitude {{converter}} {{creates the}} sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word {{received from the}} PA. The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which {{take advantage of the}} quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E
5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Wing {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Richmond on 7October 1942. Its initial {{commander}} was Group Captain Allan Walters and the wing leader was Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war. At {{this time the}} RAAF had received 71 tropicalised variants of the Spitfire Vc and another 33 were en route to Australia. These aircraft differed from the standard Spitfire Vc in that they were optimised for use in desert and tropical areas and had been fitted with a Vokes air filter beneath their nose <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> sand and dust which entered the engine; Caldwell believed that this modification reduced the Spitfires' performance. As well as the three Spitfire squadrons, No.1 Wing also included No. 10 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters. Many of the squadrons' most experienced pilots were posted to other units before they departed Britain, and only 37 of the 95 pilots in the wing as at May 1943 had previously seen combat.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line {{up in the same}} direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
