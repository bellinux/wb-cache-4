5|$|July 15: The MAUD Committee issues final {{detailed}} {{technical report}} on design and costs {{to develop a}} bomb. Advance copy sent to Vannevar Bush who decides <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> official version before taking any action.|$|E
5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable a person <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> a longer delay, {{as long as}} the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|On a bluff {{overlooking}} Zack and Cloud, who had hitched {{a ride on}} a truck, Shinra operatives {{decide to}} ignore orders <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the Turks. One takes aim at the incapacitated Cloud. Zack jumps in front of Cloud, yelling at him to escape.|$|E

60|$|Her day was {{as regular}} and methodical as her husband’s. The morning {{was devoted to}} {{assisting}} and superintending the general servant for the time being; after dinner, at one o’clock, she retired upstairs to dress {{and went down to}} the shops to make a few purchases, returning in good time to give her husband tea. The early part of the evening was devoted <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> supper; the latter part <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> bed.|$|R
5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with no alternative but <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the Americans {{to make the first}} move and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} convoy reached Guadalcanal {{and successfully}} unloaded its cargo on 30–31 January. The rest of Halsey's warships took {{station in the}} Coral Sea south of the Solomons <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the approach of any Japanese warship forces supporting what the Allies believed to be an imminent offensive. The departure of TF18 from the Guadalcanal area removed a significant potential threat to the Ke operation.|$|E
5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that front-office changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but he chose not <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the Senators to make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E

50|$|The {{play has}} often been {{compared}} <b>to</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> Godot, by Samuel Beckett, and other absurdist plays because of its apparent lack of plot and action.|$|R
5000|$|Hunter-killer groups, {{whose job}} was to {{actively}} seek out enemy submarines, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the convoy <b>to</b> come under attack. Later hunter-killer groups were centered around escort carriers.|$|R
5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> their {{wants and needs}} to be met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away and turned to religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends {{to go to war}} in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person view. Players {{complete}} missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> further instructions or events. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's open world, and {{have the ability to}} complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the islands are unlocked to players as the story progresses.|$|E

5|$|Gunnery {{developments}} in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related {{problem was that the}} shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns' faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.|$|E
5|$|Imamura was {{up against}} a resourceful, {{resolute}} and aggressive opponent, who also had access to good intelligence. Allied Ultra codebreakers were reading the Japanese shipping codes, and, by 3 January 1943, Allied commanders knew in advance about the force that Adachi was planning to send from Rabaul to Lae, although {{they did not know}} the force's ultimate destination. Blamey chose not <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade to move from Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E
5|$|In Book Two, Jake {{is joined}} by Bill Gorton, {{recently}} arrived from New York, and Brett's fiancé Mike Campbell, who arrives from Scotland. Jake and Bill travel south and meet Robert Cohn at Bayonne for a fishing trip in the hills northeast of Pamplona. Instead of fishing, Cohn stays in Pamplona <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the overdue Brett and Mike. Cohn {{had an affair with}} Brett a few weeks earlier and still feels possessive of her despite her engagement to Mike. After Jake and Bill enjoy five days of fishing the streams near Burguete, they rejoin the group in Pamplona.|$|E

5|$|In March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a black fifteen-year-old schoolgirl in Montgomery, {{refused to}} give up her bus seat to a white man in {{compliance}} with Jim Crow laws, which were local regulations in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried, E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> a better case to pursue.|$|E
5|$|It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, as {{a priest}} in 1115, {{although}} Thurstan had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> consecration as bishop for another four years. Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop. Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf's niece, and after sleeping with the girl, took no action on the charges against Ranulf. The story {{is unlikely to be}} true.|$|E
5|$|Japanese carrier {{doctrine}} {{preferred the}} launching of fully constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation of whether the American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire. In addition, the arrival of another land-based American air strike at 07:53 gave weight {{to the need to}} attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) {{prepares to}} take the Academy {{entrance}} exam himself. He succeeds in passing several parts of the exam, and helps Mordock (John Putch), a highly talented Benzite and fellow competitor, to solve a difficult test problem {{so that they may}} both advance. Wesley is worried about the psychological part of the exam, and he is directed to a room <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the test to start.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2012, {{the show}} {{producer}} Christer Björkman advised the public {{not to buy}} tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> tickets to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, some may be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|RTÉ {{received}} a letter from Lee confirming his intentions to return after his leave of absence.

Exactly a year after leaving RTÉ, he returned to the broadcaster on 5 May 2010. He worked as an advisor on the RTÉ business desk. He presented Mind Your Business on RTÉ Radio 1 on Saturday Mornings as a summer replacement for The Business.|$|E
