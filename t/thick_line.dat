25|$|The Sierpinski {{triangle}} {{also appears}} in certain cellular automata (such as Rule 90), including those relating to Conway's Game of Life. For instance, the Life-like cellular automaton B1/S12 {{when applied to}} a single cell will generate four approximations of the Sierpinski triangle. A very long one cell <b>thick</b> <b>line</b> in standard life will create two mirrored Sierpinski triangles. The time-space diagram of a replicator pattern in a cellular automaton also often resembles a Sierpinski triangle, {{such as that of}} the common replicator in HighLife.|$|E
25|$|Not {{far from}} the GE plant is {{downtown}} Schenectady, which the now six-lane I-890 largely bypasses {{to the south and}} west on an elevated highway passing over a mostly industrial section of the city. The section closest to the city center runs past by the campus of Schenectady County Community College and provides panoramic views of downtown Schenectady. I-890 heads south from downtown, crossing over the Delaware and Hudson Railway and CSX's Hudson Subdivision before finally connecting to downtown by way of Broadway at exit5. Past Broadway, the elevated highway comes to an end as I-890 heads southeastward into a dense residential area on a plateau overlooking the city. The homes are not visible from I-890, however, as the freeway is lined on both sides by a <b>thick</b> <b>line</b> of trees serving as noise barriers.|$|E

25|$|Durbar Hall is {{situated}} {{directly under the}} double-dome of the main building. Known as the “Throne Room” before independence, it had two separate thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine. Presently, a single high chair for the President is kept here under a 2-ton chandelier hanging from a height of 33 m by a 23 m long rope. The flooring of the hall is made of chocolate-coloured Italian marble. The columns in Durbar Hall are made in Delhi Order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which {{could not have been}} done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The columns are made from yellow Jaisalmer marble, with a <b>thick</b> <b>line</b> running along the centre. It is said that the line thus drawn on the floor perfectly divides the mansion into two equal parts. It houses a 5th century Buddha statue from the Gupta period. This ancient Buddha statue is in a perfect straight line to the Gupta-period Bull placed outside and onto the India Gate at the end of Rajpath. The elevation of Raisina Hills is so much that the top of the India Gate lies at the same level as the feet of the Buddha’s statue placed in the Durbar Hall. The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration.|$|E

2500|$|The Cross Timbers, a <b>thick</b> <b>line</b> {{of nearly}} impassable trees and brush running {{from north to}} south, created an {{effective}} east-west barrier separating the flat, dry lands inhabited by the plains Indians to the west from the rolling prairies to the east where the Five Civilized Tribes were locating. [...] These indigenous tribes included the Comanche, Wichita, Caddoes, and Kiowa. [...] They occasionally threatened the removed tribes with raids. [...] The Choctaws mostly settled {{in the eastern part}} of their territory since the western end was less secure against raids from the plains Indians, and they had protection from federal troops located at Fort Towson.|$|E
2500|$|The {{centre line}} divides {{the ice in}} half crosswise. It is used to judge icing, meaning that if a team sends the puck across the centre line (red line), blue line and then across the goal line (that is to say, shoots or dumps the puck past the goal line from behind their own side of the centre line) {{it is said to}} be icing. It is a <b>thick</b> <b>line,</b> and in the NHL must [...] "contain regular {{interval}} markings of a uniform distinctive design, which will readily distinguish it from the two blue lines." [...] When discussing differences in the rules of the game, it is often said that a game is played with no red line. This simply means that there is no [...] two-line pass violation. The centre line is still used to judge icing violations.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{adjunct to}} the ISO paper sizes, particularly the A series, are the technical drawing line widths specified in ISO 128, and the matching technical pen widths of 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.40, and 2.0 mm, as specified in [...] Color codes {{are assigned to}} each size to facilitate easy recognition by the drafter. These sizes increase {{by a factor of}} , so that particular pens can be used on particular sizes of paper, and then the next smaller or larger size can be used to continue the drawing after it has been reduced or enlarged, respectively. For example, a continuous <b>thick</b> <b>line</b> on A0 size paper shall be drawn with a 0.7 mm pen, the same line on A1 paper shall be drawn with a 0.5 mm pen, and finally on A2, A3, or A4 paper it shall be drawn with a 0.35 mm pen.|$|E

Now {{the first}} {{question}} respecting it is: what place is your <b>thick</b> <b>line</b> to have {{with respect to the}} limit which it represents--outside of it, or inside, or over it? Theoretically, it is to be over it; the true limit falling all the way along the center of your <b>thick</b> <b>line.</b> The contest of Apelles with Protogenes consisted in striking this true limit within each other's lines, more and more finely. And you may always consider your pen line as representing the first incision for sculpture, the true limit being the sharp center of the incision.|$|E

40|$|Society for Education, Music, and Psychology Research. The staves of 63 {{scores of}} popular {{keyboard}} music from 50 publishers were measured. The staves had similar height but lines that varied in thickness from 0. 1 mm to 0. 45 mm. Evidence from visual psychophysics suggests {{that when the}} stave has <b>thick</b> <b>lines,</b> perceptual distortions are likely to affect {{the clarity of the}} score adversely. Students were asked to sight-read scores comprising random notes ("chromatic") or random notes in the key of G. The scores had staves with lines that were 0. 1 mm or 0. 4 mm thick (current typographic practice). Twice as many errors were made when the staves had <b>thick</b> <b>lines,</b> although the scores were then read more slowly. Scores in the key of G were read more accurately than the "chromatic" scores, but those with <b>thick</b> <b>lines</b> were read with as many errors as "chromatic" scores with thin lines. There was a tendency for individuals with susceptibility to pattern glare to read the scores with <b>thick</b> <b>lines</b> relatively slowly. The findings suggest that perceptual distortions can impair sight-reading of music manuscript because of the pattern from the lines of the stave; using thinner lines can increase both sight reading accuracy and speed...|$|R
