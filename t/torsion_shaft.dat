As separate shafts are used for propeller and turbine, this aids them to rotate at different RPM. A <b>torsion</b> <b>shaft</b> is used to transmit the torque from main shaft to propeller shaft. <b>Torsion</b> <b>shaft</b> is used to give a deflection which is also used to measure the torque of the engine.

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are {{machine components}} using friction to transfer torque and providing interruptible connection between rotating shafts in different automobile applications including automatic transmissions. Like any friction generating machine components, wet clutches {{are susceptible to}} continuous wear and degradation during sliding. This regular deterioration process {{as well as the}} choice of operating conditions, ultimately change the overall system performance during operation due to resultant change in the system parameters. The first part of this thesis summarizes some of the notable studies on the wet clutch tribological performance and clarifies goals of the investigation. Previously, plenty of experimental studies on wet clutches have been reported but still some effects regarding the water contamination problem and the influence of mechanical design factors are not covered thoroughly. The thesis aims to experimentally analyse these two different aspects for improving wet clutch performance regarding frictional characteristics and reliability. These two investigations are focused on wet clutches in automatic transmission applications. For evaluating friction behaviour during a long clutch engagement period, suitable test equipment is designed where standard paper based friction plates and steel separator plates are tested with commercially available ATF. To investigate a clutch operated in a controlled environment is one of main the research objectives. The vital concern while designing the test rig is to monitor the clutch parameters for achieving the desired operating conditions for individual tests. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. An experimental study on wet clutch frictional behaviour under water contaminated lubrication condition reveals the change in the friction level for a water contaminated lubricant. It was shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water was influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. The test results also showed a higher change in the separator plate's roughness parameter (Ra) for water contaminated systems compared to an uncontaminated wet clutch. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the choice of these design factors can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased <b>torsion</b> <b>shaft</b> stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are lubricated {{machine components}} which utilize friction to transfer torque and thus establish connection between shafts rotating at different speeds. They {{are used in}} automatic transmission as shifting device or lockup clutch. As well as cooling the contacting surfaces, the lubrication provides controlled friction, smooth performance and long life. Because of this advantage, wet clutches are applicable for heavy duty vehicles (e. g. construction equipment, tractors) to handle high power. However, like any other tribological system, wet clutch performance is dependent on several factors concerning operating conditions, system design etc. As a friction generating machine component, the degradation of the lubricant and the contacting clutch surfaces are continuous process and the friction behavior also changes consequently with the progression of the system deterioration and that directly influences the clutch performance. So, to investigate the clutch influencing factors and fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism is of great interest. Though wet clutches were immensely studied earlier to investigate different issues, there was lack of clear understanding and knowledge concerning water contamination problem and the system design parameters. The main aim of this thesis is to experimentally evaluate and explain the impact of water contamination and to verify different system design parameters’ influence on wet clutch tribological performance. The study focused on the wet clutches in automatic transmissions. Initially the thesis reviews {{the state of the}} art in wet clutch research, discusses the motivation for the current research aim and clarifies the goals of the investigation. Later the details of the experimental method and findings are discussed in this thesis. Since evaluating the friction behaviour in desired environment is the key requirement, an automated wet clutch test rig was utilized to carry out the friction test where operating conditions (slip time, oil temperature, contact pressure/load, sliding speed) can be controlled and the output torque, contact temperature etc. can monitored. This suitable test equipment was designed for standard paper based friction plate and steel separator plate lubricated with automatic transmission fluid. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. In the first part of the thesis the effect of water contamination on wet clutch tribological performances is experimentally investigated. The study reveals that both the friction reliability and the friction-velocity relation are influenced by the change in the friction behaviour for a water contaminated lubricant. It is shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water is influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. Then the study is continued for longer test to evaluate the ageing of the friction interfaces and the lubricant. Though water does not show any long term effect on water contaminated ATF as it is seen in case of friction interfaces, the short term effect in the surface active additives is observed in the current research. This finding also supported the investigation on the water contaminated friction interface degradation and the effect of water on additive adsorption of the contacting surfaces. It was found that the addition of water in ATF intensifies the mean friction coefficient, but in the long run the loss of friction much faster and high, which can in fact degrade the clutch life faster as well. Two simplified ATF was also analysed along with the commercial fully formulated ATF for investigating the water impact to get a simple and comprehensive overview of the consequence. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the change in the clutch frictional behaviour with time and degradation can largely influence by the choice of these design factors. This can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased <b>torsion</b> <b>shaft</b> stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

Recently, the knowledge of fatigue crack growth under typical loading conditions of axles and shafts with rotating bending and steady torsion is being object of research and industrial studies in order to apply damage tolerance concepts, mainly for maintenance purposes. The effect of a steady torsion on fatigue crack growth under rotating bending is focused in this paper. While axles and shafts in the transportation industry are traditionally designed on steels, the need for weight reduction due to fuel economy and eco-design constraints, lightweight materials must be considered for these applications.

40|$|The {{influence}} on coupling vibrations and stability among shaft-torsion, disk-transverse and blade-bending of a rotor {{system with a}} mistuned blade's staggle angle was investigated analytically. A shaft-disk-blade system has been found existing two types of coupling vibrations, disk-blade (DB), and blade-blade (BB) modes when the shaft was assumed rigid. If the shaft's torsional flexibility was taken into account, an additional type of coupling modes, shaft-disk-blade (SDB), appeared. When an angle-mistuned blade existed, the blades periodicity was destroyed and it was found to change not only the natural frequencies but also the types of modes. Due to blade's mistune, the <b>shaft</b> <b>torsion</b> had to participate to balance such that DB modes vanished and replaced by SDB modes. A mistuned staggle angle was numerically found to alter the natural frequencies in an almost linear trend. At last, the rotational effects were found to merge frequency loci and eventually reached an instability point. Very interestingly, a mistuned blade diminished the possible instability caused by blade-dominating modes, which existed in a perfect and periodic rotor.

For this purpose {{specimens}} of square cross-sections were used [...] This activity constitutes a laboratory unit in Mechanics of Materials course taught at the junior level. The students are first introduced {{to the fact that the}} torsional stresses and deformations are the simplest for the circular cross-section, where the plane sections remain plane before and after the application of torque. The setup used for the experiment on torsion of a circular shaft was employed to study <b>torsion</b> of a <b>shaft</b> of square cross-section. The results for the circular cross-section were used to compute the shear modulus which was then used in the expressions for torsional stiffness of a square shaft by addressing warping. Warping in square shafts was demonstrated using geometrically similar Styrofoam specimens. Both the circular and square cross sections were further studied using the membrane analogy in which rubber membranes were stretched over square and round holes on plates pressurized by air from beneath the holes. The membranes were bulged forming “torsion ” hills and the slopes at different locations around the contour were noted. These slopes were proportional to the shear stresses at the outer edge of the cross section...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical method of solving torsional vibration problems concerning a sandwich circular shaft with a viscoelastic soft and light interlayer. The elasticity and damping coefficients of the inter-layer {{are assumed to}} be dependent on its geometrical characteristic and viscoelastic properties of the interlayer material. Complex functions of a real variable are applied in the solution to free and forced vibration problems. Then, the property of orthogonality of complex modes of the free vibration, which is the basis for solving the free vibration problem for arbitrary initial conditions, has been demonstrated. The {{solution to the problem of}} real stationary forced vibration has been obtained on the grounds of the complex stationary modes of vibration.

40|$|Tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty has rapidly {{become the}} {{procedure}} {{of choice for}} repair of distal penile hypospadias (DPH) at most of the centres throughout the world. Multiple series from major institutions have reported excellent cosmetic and functional results in conjunction with low complication rates. A retrospective review of 52 new cases of DPH where TIP urethroplasty was performed in Medical College Jammu has been analysed. Age range of the patients {{included in the study}} varied between 2 and 18 years with majority 47 (97. 3 %) below 5 years. Ten (19. 9 %) patients had chordee, which got corrected by degloving of the penis except 3 (5. 7 %) who required tunica albuginea plication. Neourethra was covered with vascularized pedicled dartos flap from the inner prepuce. Major complications occurred in 7 (13. 4 %) patients [urethrocutaneous fistula- 5 (11. 5 %) patients, meatal stenosis- 1 (1. 9 %) patient and complete breakdown- 1 (1. 9 %) patient]. There were also minor complications like superficial skin necrosis in 10 (19. 2 %) patients and haematoma formation in 1 (1. 9 %) patient. Functional results as judged by the urinary stream, were good in 46 (88. 8 %) patients. Excellent cosmetic result was seen in 44 (84. 6 %) patients except 2 (3. 8 %) who had mild <b>torsion</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> Conclusion: Tubularized incised plate urethroplasty with dartos flap cover is a simple, single stage procedure for DPH with excellent cosmetic and functional results and is associated with minimal complications...|$|R
