5|$|Reyes and Doggett {{arrive in}} Novi {{and talk to}} Detective Van Allen (James McDonnell), who seems apathetic about the case. At the same time, Scully {{contacts}} Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several bodies in the 1960s that were skinned {{in a manner similar}} to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not pay much attention to the cases, emphasizing that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local butchery to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is skinned. In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died.|$|E
5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E

Fox {{believed that the}} King's illness was permanent, and therefore that George III was, constitutionally speaking, dead. To challenge the Prince of Wales's right to succeed him would be to challenge fundamental contemporary assumptions about property rights and primogeniture. Pitt, on the other hand, considered the King's madness temporary (or, at least, hoped that it would be), and thus saw the throne as temporarily unoccupied rather than vacant.|$|E

Also between Trondheim and Støren there was initially only a single daily round trip, increasing to two from 1870. Traffic was above prognosis, soon resulting in the ordering of additional rolling stock. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice as much cargo heading southwards as northwards.|$|E

500|$|But the 1993 {{case would}} be {{revisited}} again with the 2003 allegations. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year between Jackson's 2003 arrest {{and the beginning of}} his trial and he was prevented by a gag order from responding to any stories in the media. [...] As in 1993, there were leaked documents e.g. Jordan Chandler's 1993 police statement. The media was again eager to report on the allegations, with a tendency for sensationalism. And allegations sold to tabloid TV shows by disgruntled ex-employees in the 1990s were constantly in the news again. Also similar to 1993, details of the Arvizo family's 2003 allegations were leaked. These stories were mostly reported as allegations rather than facts, but the volume and frequency of stories, combined with Jackson's inability to refute them, had a devastating impact on public opinion of him.|$|E

500|$|The {{beginning}} of set theory as {{a branch of}} mathematics is often marked by the publication of Cantor's 1874 paper, [...] "Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen" [...] ("On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers"). This paper {{was the first to}} provide a rigorous proof that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one kind of infinity. Previously, all infinite collections had been implicitly assumed to be equinumerous (that is, of [...] "the same size" [...] or having the same number of elements). Cantor proved that the collection of real numbers and the collection of positive integers are not equinumerous. In other words, the real numbers are not countable. His proof differs from diagonal argument that he gave in 1891. Cantor's article also contains a new method of constructing transcendental numbers. Transcendental numbers were first constructed by Joseph Liouville in 1844.|$|E
500|$|As {{well as the}} harp, Forbes was an {{accomplished}} public reciter; {{in the summer of}} 1930, he won the Scots Verse recital contest at the Aberdeen Music Festival, and was paid by Beltona to make a series of recordings of the poems of Charles Murray. After returning from Paris, he led a troupe of Scottish country dancers – the [...] "Dancers of Don", that he had formed together with Isabella Mitchell. By this time, Forbes's heart was set on studying medicine. However, his father refused to fund his studies, arguing that since <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough work to be done managing the estate, {{there was no need for}} him to study further. Ewan resolved to fund his own studies, aiming to put aside £1,000 to cover the costs. In 1933, he studied under the psychologist Leonhard Seif in Munich, living with the British novelist Phyllis Bottome. Whilst there, he witnessed the German elections which brought the Nazi Party into power, and heard Adolf Hitler speak.|$|E
500|$|Athens is the {{city-state}} that is best documented, both {{in terms}} of epikleroi and in all aspects of legal history. Athenian law on epikleroi was attributed to Solon; women with no brothers had to marry their nearest male relative on their paternal side of the family, starting with their father's brother and moving from there to the next nearest male relative on the paternal side. The historian John Gould notes that the order of relatives that were required to marry the epikleros coincided with the relatives required to avenge a murder. This set of relatives was known as the anchisteia (...) in Athens. The anchisteia was also the group of relatives who would inherit property in the absence of legal heirs. If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one possible spouse in a set of relatives, the right to marry the epikleros went to the eldest one. The property that was inherited could also be in debt, which would not affect the epikleros status.|$|E

500|$|When silver {{prices rose}} {{relative}} to gold {{as a reaction}} to the California Gold Rush, silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative (and future president) Andrew Johnson, the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853, allowing them to circulate. Until then, depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above; the Act of 1853 lightened the silver coins from the half dime to the half dollar and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations. Depositors could still choose to have silver struck into dollar coins, but since <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a dollar's worth of silver in a dollar coin, it was more profitable to sell the bullion to manufacturers and jewelers. [...] So long as silver prices remained high, this effectively placed the United States on the gold standard.|$|E
