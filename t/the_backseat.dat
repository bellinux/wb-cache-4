5|$|The Haas {{brothers}} began {{competing for}} Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in November 1999, losing to The King Pinz at The War Begins on November 20, 1999. They competed regularly for CZW throughout early 2000, {{and won the}} CZW World Tag Team Championship on February 12 at Climbing The Ladder by defeating The Kashmerino Brothers and The Thrill Kill Kult in a three-way match. On July 10, they lost the championship to <b>The</b> <b>Backseat</b> Boyz at Caged To The End, when Johnny Kashmere defeated Russ in a singles match and was awarded the championship.|$|E
5|$|After debuting in 1996 as a {{professional}} wrestler, Haas regularly teamed with his brother Russ for numerous independent promotions. On July 22, 1998, The Haas Brothers won the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Skin Head Express. They lost it to The Nation of Immigration just over a month later on August 25. They won the championship {{for the second time}} on May 21, 1999, by defeating The Big Unit (Rick Silver and Dave Desire), and held the championship until February 25, 2000 when they were defeated by Da Hit Squad. During 2000 they also held the Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship and the ECWA Tag Team Championship in the East Coast Wrestling Association promotion, which they won by defeating <b>The</b> <b>Backseat</b> Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere).|$|E
5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's {{limousine}} time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing {{that he was the}} man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
50|$|In {{anticipation}} of <b>the</b> release of <b>Backseat</b> Heroine, Emma-Lee released a weekly “Track by Track” interview every Tuesday {{leading up to}} <b>the</b> release of <b>Backseat</b> Heroine. <b>The</b> videos featured Karen Karen Kosowski, Marc Rogers, Emma-Lee and her bandmates. In each video the band discusses {{the making of a}} different track from <b>the</b> record <b>Backseat</b> Heroine with Rich Terfry at The Chalet.|$|R
50|$|Ham and Ex {{are reading}} {{a press release}} about their uncle Beans who is flying north to explore an old galleon. Outside, Beans is {{preparing}} his aircraft for his trip to the north. Without their uncle's knowledge, Ham and Ex board <b>the</b> <b>backseats.</b> Beans himself finally hops in and flies the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The W169 is {{constructed}} with high-strength steel alloys with bonded joints. It {{has a large}} number of airbags including optional rear side airbags (for side-impacts in <b>the</b> <b>backseats),</b> optional side-curtain airbags, and standard head and thorax-protection side airbags. The front airbags are adaptive with two-stage gas generators operating according to the severity of accident.|$|R
5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in <b>the</b> <b>backseat.</b> Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{track was}} {{released}} {{as the second}} single from Watch the Throne on July 20, 2011. The song peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached position 2 on both the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song has since been certified Platinum for sales exceeding 1,000,000. The song received a music video directed by Spike Jonze on August 2011. The video primarily shows West and Jay-Z modifying a Maybach luxury car and then driving around in it with no doors or windows, while four girls are smiling in <b>the</b> <b>backseat.</b> After its release, the video was met with positive reception. The cover art was designed by Italian fashion designer Riccardo Tisci.|$|E
50|$|Johannes Beeskow, a Rometsch designer, {{built the}} first {{prototype}} of a four door sedan in 1950; the donor vehicle being a Volkswagen Beetle in scrap condition. Rometsch took this concept into {{the production of a}} taxicab. The wheelbase had been stretched by about 27 cm. Access to <b>the</b> <b>backseats</b> was made more accessible by adding suicide doors. Thereafter, original doors were modified.|$|R
5000|$|The WCC crew removed <b>the</b> <b>backseats</b> and {{replaced}} it with the MTX Audio JackHammer, a 22-inch subwoofer weighing 369 pounds. A decibel meter was installed in the dash to alert Jake to keep it down. Uniquely, due to wanting a retro 1950s nature for the car, this would perhaps be the only car in Pimp My Rides history to have flat black paint, and alloys replaced with regular steel wheels, whitewalls, and hubcaps.|$|R
50|$|The EP {{was mainly}} {{produced}} by DJ Grumble, with additional production from Felly, Hollywood JB, and Dave James. The only guest appearance in this EP was from Dreamville label-mate, Cozz, on <b>the</b> song <b>Backseat.</b>|$|R
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers did {{not appear}} for JAPW again until late 2005, again in a tables, ladders, and chairs match for the tag team title, this time against the teams of Teddy Hart and Homicide, <b>the</b> <b>Backseat</b> Boyz, and The S.A.T.. The match, which took place at JAPW's 8th Year Anniversary Show, was won Hart and Homicide. At the next show, Fall Out, the S.A.T. {{defeated}} them and thus became number one contenders to the tag team championship. More recent JAPW appearances came in early 2006, losing along with the Outcast Killers to the S.A.T. once again at Wild Card II in a tag team title match, and then at Brotherly Love to the team of Sabu and Sonjay Dutt, a match they also lost. In October 2008, the Briscoes competed at JAPW's 11th Anniversary Show against LAX (Homicide and Hernandez). During a brawl outside the ring, Mark suffered a large gash {{on the side of}} his head.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting in <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor of Lamb, was moving his mouth as if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding a song that would match the movements.|$|E
5000|$|Undisguised Zim (featuring {{an equally}} undisguised {{expression}} of rage) with GIR wearing his [...] "goofy" [...] expression (his tongue hanging out and one eye half-closed) This set was presumably based on <b>the</b> episode <b>Backseat</b> Drivers from Beyond the Stars.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} the band members loading their silver car with {{recording}} equipment {{in front of the}} Stefani household. Gwen Stefani stands in front of a damaged red car and sings. They drive away, with Tom Dumont, Gwen Stefani and Tony Kanal sitting in <b>the</b> <b>backseats.</b> <b>The</b> band arrive at a building where Stefani enters the ladies' bathroom, carrying a boombox, {{and the rest of the}} band enters the gents', carrying speakers, instruments and electrical equipment. The ladies' bathroom is clean, brightly decorated and well furnished with flowers, fruit and two female assistants. The gents' bathroom is dark, dirty and bare-walled. The men set up and play their equipment in the gents' while Stefani sings in ladies'. Various men and women enter their respective bathrooms; the men use the urinals and the women check their make-up, before dancing with the band. Eventually, the men take to lifting each other through the ceiling to get into the other bathroom and the video ends with everyone dancing together in the ladies'.|$|R
25|$|On 24 June 1922, {{two months}} after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo (which renounced German {{territorial}} claims from World War I), Rathenau was assassinated. On this Saturday morning, Rathenau had himself chauffeured from his house in Berlin-Grunewald to the Foreign Office in Wilhelmstraße. During the trip, his NAG-Convertible was passed by a Mercedes-Touring car with Ernst Werner Techow behind the wheel and Erwin Kern and Hermann Fischer on <b>the</b> <b>backseats.</b> Kern opened fire with a MP 18-submachine gun at close range, killing Rathenau almost instantly, while Fischer threw a hand grenade into the car before Techow quickly drove them away. Also involved in the plot were Techow's younger brother Hans Gerd Techow, future writer Ernst von Salomon, and Willi Günther (aided and abetted by seven others, some of them schoolboys). All conspirators were members of the ultra-nationalist secret Organisation Consul (O.C.). A memorial stone in the Königsallee in Grunewald marks the scene of the crime.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 {{and into}} 2002, CZW's {{territory}} (that is, the area at which they held {{the majority of their}} events) was shifting from Sewell, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to hold events regularly at the old ECW arena, beginning with December 15's Cage of Death 3. At this event, they faced Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but wore masks and were identified as The Midnight Outlaws. This was likely to get around the fact that Jay was only 17 and Mark only 16 at the time; this meant, as they were under 18 years of age, that they could not legally work in a sport wrestling exhibition in the state of Pennsylvania. As CZW regularly began holding shows in the Philadelphia area, the Midnight Outlaws made appearances at the next four CZW events. At A Higher Level of Pain on April 13, 2002, Jay appeared across the ring from the Midnight Outlaws, tagging with Ruckus against Mark and someone else. By this time, he had turned 18. Jay and Ruckus were won the match, and this was the last time either Jay or Mark appeared for CZW until April 12, 2003, where Jay and Mark both returned for Best of the Best 3. Jay was a surprise entrant after being taunted by A.J. Styles, and Mark filling in for the injured Ruckus. Jay advanced to the semi finals, where he lost to B-Boy, and Mark lost his fill-in match to Sonjay Dutt. The two faced off with <b>the</b> <b>Backseat</b> Boyz for the CZW World Tag Team Championship at Truth or Consequences on June 14, but failed to win the belts.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E
25|$|Hart and Evans also {{wrestled}} as the Hart Foundation 2003 in November 2003, {{participating in}} a Ring of Honor (ROH) Scramble Cage match against <b>The</b> <b>Backseat</b> Boyz, The S.A.T., The Carnage Crew, and Special K. Later, Hart, Evans, Smith, and Wilson reformed the group in Major League Wrestling.|$|E
50|$|Zigmat’s {{music has}} been {{featured}} in <b>the</b> film <b>Backseat</b> (by Bruce Van Dusen) and has garnered local television appearances in New York City (Hit Records Nightlife Videos) and Philadelphia (NBC’s The 10! Show) as well as national TV appearances on Fox’s Fearless Music TV, Blender and on SiTV in Los Angeles. Radio appearances include Batanga Radio, KPFA in Los Angeles, and KCRW’s The Morning Becomes Eclectic.|$|R
5000|$|Conerly {{portrayed the}} [...] "Marlboro Man" [...] in {{commercials}} after {{playing for the}} Giants. [...] Conerly and his wife, Perian (author of <b>the</b> book, <b>Backseat</b> Quarterback) retired to his hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he spent his final days. Conerly owned shoe stores throughout the Mississippi Delta. On December 13, 1959, Perian appeared on an episode of What's My Line?. Her line was she wrote a football column for newspapers.|$|R
50|$|Compared to most compact cars of that time, the Nissan Presea {{was quite}} long. The R10 stood at 4420 mm, 15 {{centimetres}} {{longer than the}} Sentra. It was also rather low for a sedan at 1320 mm; with passengers often feeling the need to stoop {{to get into the}} car. At 1690 mm wide, it was as wide as it needed to be for two adults (and possibly a child) in the rear seats. The slightly longer wheelbase (compared to the Sunny) at 2500 mm was class-leading for that era of compact cars. All these dimensions added up to a comfortable (albeit low) car with decent comfort and presence. The boot space was more than adequate, at over 300 L in capacity. Due to <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>backseats</b> lean back (which in turn gave the rear passengers a lot more comfort), objects over 1000 mm in length and 1200 mm in width could fit. The boot height of over 400 mm also allowed for a competent handling of most purchases during shopping sprees. However the narrow aperture height limited its usability.|$|R
25|$|On August 9, 1943, Basquette {{was raped}} and robbed in Burbank, California, after {{she gave a}} ride to 22-year-old Army Private George Paul Rimke. Basquette later testified that after {{she picked up the}} soldier, he forced her into <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> and raped her. Rimke denied the charges but was found guilty on August 26, 1943 and sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
25|$|Gravano {{arranged}} to have Mormando murdered {{on his way to}} a meeting at Gravano's Bensonhurst restaurant, Tali's. After assuring Mormando of his safety, Gravano told him to pick up Joseph Paruta on his way. Paruta got in <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of the car and shot Mormando twice in the back of the head. Mormando's corpse was then disposed of in a vacant lot, where it was discovered the next day.|$|E
25|$|Alford {{has written}} about his late father's bon vivantism and alcoholism. (Alford's father, inebriated, once got in <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of the family car and, {{prepared}} to drive but sensing something was amiss, accused his wife of having stolen the steering wheel.) Alford's father once told his wife {{that he had a}} job in Stamford, Ct., but a year later Mrs. Alford discovered that her husband was unemployed and {{spending a lot of time}} in bars.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{custom built}} <b>Backseat</b> Driver telemetery and data {{acquisition}} system was first used this year. It was a dashboard mounted unit with a rudimentary on-board LED display, and entirely through-hole based circuit board with a remote mounted accelerometer and telemetry radio.|$|R
50|$|Mizrock is Miz's second Japanese {{album and}} {{contains}} the a-sides and b-sides {{to the last}} three singles before it: In <b>The</b> Sky, <b>Backseat</b> Baby, and Bittersweet. This album revolves more around rock (hence the name Mizrock) and jerkier tunes. The English version of New Day (bonus track on the limited edition) {{is the same as}} the one in Dreams. The English version of the track In The Sky was used in the Square-Enix game Grandia III.|$|R
5000|$|Max Nicholson of IGN {{rated the}} episode an 8/10, writing, [...] "Overall ... {{this was a}} solid entry for Season 7. The writing is still sharp, and the {{animation}} has never looked better. It was also nice to see Bender's character treading a little more ground beyond <b>the</b> traditional <b>backseat</b> one-liners. While Ben would obviously disrupt {{the balance of the}} main ensemble, it was a fitting introduction for what could be a recurring character on the show (similar to Cubert or Dwight)." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{scene where}} Nicholas' taxi drives into the San Francisco Bay was shot near the Embarcadero, with the {{close-up}} of Douglas {{trapped in the}} back seat filmed on a soundstage at Sony Pictures studio in a large tank of water. The actor was in a small compartment that was designed to resemble <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of a taxi with three cameras capturing the action. Principal photography lasted 100 days with a lot of shooting done at night utilizing numerous locations.|$|E
25|$|The PCW Tag Team Championship was {{the primary}} tag team title for Phoenix Championship Wrestling. It was the second {{championship}} introduced by the promotion and first won by <b>The</b> <b>Backseat</b> Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere) from Combat Zone Wrestling's Ric Blade & Nicky Benz in Stanhope, New Jersey on March 3, 2001. It was frequently defended in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with exception to the 10-month period when it was vacated, from 2001 until the promotion's close two years later.|$|E

5000|$|Airbag Safety: Before {{the first}} challenge, Andrew gives the {{remaining}} five drivers a brief safety lesson {{on the dangers}} that {{can be caused by}} the violent inflation of an airbag, as nearly all of them have bad habits that could cause them to be injured (Mariah's constant smartphone use, Tyler's habit of hunching over his wheel, Jason's incorrect wheel grip, and Chanie's bizarre driving posture; Siham is again the only driver with no major issues in this department). The triggering of a Honda Civic's passenger-side airbag is shown to be so violent that it blows the rear-view mirror into <b>the</b> car's <b>backseat,</b> shocking <b>the</b> five drivers.|$|R
