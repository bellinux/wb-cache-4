5|$|Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was {{minimally}} educated, {{working in}} textile mills {{from an early}} age. He entered into a partnership with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to issues with the mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor for part of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>term</b> after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto of a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. He was more successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.|$|E
5|$|Deady {{originally}} was {{to travel with}} a government designated Indian agent and the agent's family. At Fort Leavenworth the agent remained, and Deady continued his journey {{in the company of}} a United States Army regiment bound for Fort Vancouver. Taking the Oregon Trail, he arrived where Portland, Oregon, now stands on November 14, 1849. The next day he went to neighboring Oregon City, and then a few days later west to Lafayette, Oregon. At that city, the county seat of Yamhill County at that time, the red-haired Deady began teaching as his occupation to make ends meet. He first worked for room and board, but for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>term</b> of the school year he was paid $75 per month.|$|E

5|$|Throughout much of {{the twentieth}} century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and {{military}} unrest. After Juan Vicente Gómez's long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with Marcos Pérez Jiménez's overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes. Until 1998, the dominant political parties were Acción Democrática and COPEI, who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>term</b> in office for Acción Democrática's Carlos Andrés Pérez, Venezuela {{was hit by a}} severe economic crisis. A wave of protests known as the Caracazo engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was again}} activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven {{of the ten}} original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was {{necessary in order to}} fill out the companies and thus the roster during <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>term</b> was different than the 90-day term. To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term. Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at Camp Henry Wilson in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship Plymouth Rock. Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.|$|E
