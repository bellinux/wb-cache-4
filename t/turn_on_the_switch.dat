40|$|This study aims at {{designing}} and implementing a single channel stand-alone Brain-Controlled Switch (BCS) device, which records the electroencephalography (EEG) {{signals from the}} scalp using electrodes, amplifies it, eliminates interferences (associated with the EEG signals) and processes the EEG signals to extract and decode temporal signal features to determine user’s intention of regulating an external switch. The design of our “brain-controlled switch” device is implemented using a bio-potential amplifier and a microcontroller. The bio-potential amplifier amplifies the EEG signals to a level sufficient for processing, eliminates interferences and ensures patient safety. The microcontroller (dsPIC 30 F 4013) digitizes the amplified and conditioned analog EEG signals from the bio-potential amplifier, extracts the desired signal features for decoding and prediction of user’s intention and accordingly operates the external switch. When the user concentrates on an external visual stimulus or performs externally triggered movement (hand movement or motor imagery movement), a reproducible pattern appears in user’s EEG frequency bands. The analysis of these patterns is used to decode and predict user’s intention to operate an external switch. To realize our “brain-controlled switch”, we explored two EEG sources: steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) and beta rebounds, which are patterns generated in the EEG frequency bands associated with focusing on an external visual stimulus or performing externally triggered movements. In case of SSVEP based brain controlled switch, a repetitive visual stimulus (LED flickering at a specified frequency) was used. When the user concentrates on the flickering LED, a dominant fundamental frequency (equivalent to the flickering frequency) appears in the spectral representation of the EEG signals recorded at occipital lobes. Our microcontroller implemented a digital band pass filter to extract the frequency band containing this fundamental frequency and continuously took an average of the amplitude power every predetermined time interval. Whenever the amplitude average power exceeded the preset power threshold the external switch was turned ON. A healthy subject participated in this study, and it took approximately 3. 14 ± 1. 81 seconds of active concentration for the subject to <b>turn</b> <b>ON</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> in real time with a false positive rate of 1. 17 %. In case of beta rebound based brain controlled switch, the subject was instructed to perform a brisk hand movement following an external synchronization signal. Our design focused on the post-movement beta rebound which occurs after the cessation of the movement to operate the external switch. Our microcontroller in this case implemented a digital band pass filter to extract the beta band and continuously took an average of its amplitude power every predetermined time interval. Whenever the amplitude average power exceeded the preset power threshold the external switch was turned ON. It took approximately 12. 23 ± 7. 39 seconds of active urging time by the subject to <b>turn</b> <b>ON</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> in real time with a false positive rate of 9. 33 %.

40|$|The high {{environmental}} adaptability {{of bacteria}} is contingent upon {{their ability to}} sense changes in their surroundings. Bacterial pathogen entry into host poses an abrupt and dramatic environmental change, during which successful pathogens gauge multiple parameters that signal host localization. The facultative human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes flourishes in soil, water and food, and in ~ 50 different animals, {{and serves as a}} model for intracellular infection. L. monocytogenes identifies host entry by sensing both physical (e. g., temperature) and chemical (e. g., metabolite concentrations) factors. We report here that L-glutamine, an abundant nitrogen source in host serum and cells, serves as an environmental indicator and inducer of virulence gene expression. In contrast, ammonia, which is the most abundant nitrogen source in soil and water, fully supports growth, but fails to activate virulence gene transcription. We demonstrate that induction of virulence genes only occurs when the Listerial intracellular concentration of L-glutamine crosses a certain threshold, acting as an on/off switch: off when L-glutamine concentrations are below the threshold, and fully on when the threshold is crossed. To <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch,</b> L-glutamine must be present, and the L-glutamine high affinity ABC transporter, GlnPQ, must be active. Inactivation of GlnPQ led to complete arrest of L-glutamine uptake, reduced type I interferon response in infected macrophages, dramatic reduction in expression of virulence genes, and attenuated virulence in a mouse infection model. These results may explain observations made with other pathogens correlating nitrogen metabolism and virulence, and suggest that gauging of L-glutamine as a means of ascertaining host localization may be a general mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the development of}} an EEG-based brain controlled switch and the design of a software for nerve conduction study. For EEG-based brain controlled switch, we proposed a novel paradigm for an online brain-controlled switch based on Event-Related Synchronizations (ERDs) following external sync signals. Furthermore, the ERD feature was enhanced by 3 event-related moving averages and the performance was tested online. Subjects were instructed to perform an intended motor task following an external sync signal in order to turn on a virtual switch. Meanwhile, the beta-band (16 - 20 Hz) relative ERD power (ERD in reverse value order) of a single EEG Laplacian channel from primary motor area was calculated and filtered by 3 event-related moving average in real-time. The computer continuously monitored the filtered relative ERD power level until it exceeded a pre-set threshold selected based on the observations of ERD power range to turn on the virtual switch. Four right handed healthy volunteers participated in this study. The false positive rates encountered among the four subjects during the operation of the virtual switch were 0. 8 ± 0. 4 %, whereby the response time delay was 36. 9 ± 13. 0 s and the subjects required approximately 12. 3 ± 4. 4 s of active urging time to perform repeated attempts in order to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> in the online experiments.

A waveform generation model was built to generalize the response waveform near the standard stimulus site within study interest region based on the extracted waveforms and normal reference parameters of each study and stimulus site coordinates.

The windings become a closed superconducting loop, the power supply can be turned off, and persistent currents will flow for months, preserving the magnetic field. The advantage of this persistent mode is that stability of the magnetic field is better than is achievable with the best power supplies, and no energy is needed to power the windings. The short circuit is made by a 'persistent switch', a piece of superconductor inside the magnet connected across the winding ends, attached to a small heater.

40|$|AbstractInducing {{tumor cell}} death {{is one of}} the major {{therapeutic}} strategies in treating cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism underlying the involvement of autophagy in cell death induced by timosaponin AIII (TAIII). Cell viability was determined by MTT and cologenic assay; apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay; autophagy was examined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence; ubiquitination was detected by co-immunoprecipitation; mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR; and determination of necrotic cell death was approached with LDH assay. The in vivo tumor growth inhibition was determined by xenograft model. TAIII exhibits potent cytotoxicity on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells without severe hepatic toxicity. TAIII induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCC, and the induction of apoptosis was attributed to the inhibition of TAIII on XIAP expression. Repressing XIAP expression allowed cell tolerance toward the treatment with TAIII. The suppression of XIAP by TAIII is under post-transcriptional control and independent of proteasomal-driven proteolysis. Instead, TAIII-induced AMPKα/mTOR-dependent autophagy was responsible for XIAP suppression and triggered the XIAP heading lysosomal degradation pathway. Ubiquitination of IAPs is required for the autophagic degradation induced by TAIII. Blockade of autophagy <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> of necrotic cell death in TAIII-treated cells.

Δtup 1 cells did not undergo the white-opaque transition, but it did switch spontaneously, at high frequency (∼ 10 − 3), and unidirectionally through the following sequence of colony (and cellular) phenotypes: “fuzzy large” (primarily hyphae) → “fuzzy small” (primarily pseudohyphae) → “smooth” (primarily budding yeast) → “revertant fuzzy” (primarily pseudohyphae). Northern analysis of white-phase, opaque-phase, and hypha-associated genes demonstrated that Tup 1 p also plays a role in the regulation of select phase-specific genes and that each variant in <b>the</b> Δtup 1 <b>switching</b> lineage differs in the level of expression of one or more phase-specific and/or hypha-associated genes.

Recently, inducible regulation of RNAi in mammalian cells using either tetracycline- or ecdysone-responsive systems has been developed to prevent potential lethality or non-physiological responses associated with persistent suppression of genes that are essential for cell survival or cell cycle progression. Here we show that the inducible regulation of RNAi also can be achieved by using a Cre–LoxP approach. We demonstrate that the insertion of a loxP-flanked neomycin cassette into RNA polymerase III promoter, which controls a vector-based RNAi unit, impairs the promoter activity. However, the expression of RNAi construct can be completely restored upon the removal of the neo cassette using a tamoxifen inducible Cre construct.

Chips which has cutted, fall into the conveyor and then will be detected by photodiode sensor. Crackers shredded results will be displayed on seven segment. This system has been realized and can be worked very well with display at seven segment for counting...|$|R
5000|$|In 1976 Stommelen had the honour {{to drive}} the maiden race of the Porsche 936 at the 300 km Nürburgring race. With a black body and without the air-intake, the 936 of this race {{became known as the}} black widow. He {{qualified}} second, between the factory Renault Alpine A442 of Patrick Depailler and Jean-Pierre Jabouille in first and third. The Renault team was eager to win at Porsche's home soil. On race-day in heavy rain, Stommelen managed to overtake the Renault in front right after the start. Now in the lead, he rushed towards the Nordkehre, braked and let deliberately room for the Renaults in pursuit to overtake. The Renaults, wanting to take back the lead after 2 of 300 km, rushed past Stommelen into the water puddles and crashed into the catch-fences in tandem, with Stommelen taking back the lead again. This led to the saying [...] "On the Nordschleife, you can never brake later than Rolf Stommelen!". After the sixth lap, the throttle cable of the 936 stuck in the [...] "open" [...] position. But instead of giving up, Stommelen continued the race by turning off <b>the</b> master <b>switch</b> at <b>the</b> bends to brake, and <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> master <b>switch</b> again after <b>the</b> bends to accelerate {{throughout the rest of the}} race, taking second place at the end of the race.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark VI {{had more}} ornate styling than the Town Car, {{befitting}} its place <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> model line. It sported vacuum-operated concealed headlamps, non-functional fender vents, oval opera windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> C-pillars, a [...] "Continental-esque" [...] trunklid, {{and a slightly}} different grille. An unusual optional feature, called [...] "touring lights", were installed externally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concealed headlamp doors, which gave an appearance of being headlights, when the actual headlights were behind the doors. The touring lights would only <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> if <b>the</b> headlight <b>switch</b> was in <b>the</b> parking light position, and gave a soft glow, but didn't provide enough light to drive in dark conditions. This generation was also installed with Ford's [...] "Auto Lamp" [...] feature, and if the system was active, the touring lights would not be used when the conventional headlights came <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> touring lights also did not function as daytime running lights.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} Three-Level Zero Voltage Switching PWM DC-to-DC Converter {{controlled}} by Microcontroller. The scopes of works for this project include to convert DC to DC voltage, implement Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) to increase the efficiency and lastly to apply <b>the</b> Microcontroller for <b>switching.</b> A zero-voltage-switching pulse-width-modulation three-level (ZVS PWM TL) converter realizes ZVS for <b>the</b> <b>switches</b> with <b>the</b> use of the leakage inductance (or external resonant inductance) and the output capacitors of <b>the</b> <b>switches,</b> however, <b>the</b> rectifier diodes suffer from reverse recovery which results in oscillation and voltage spike. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel ZVS PWM TL converter, which introduces two clamping diodes to the basic TL converter to eliminate the oscillation and clamp the rectified voltage to the reflected input voltage; microcontroller will generates PWM in order to operate MOSFETs so that the converter can be <b>turn</b> <b>on.</b> Meanwhile, all <b>the</b> <b>switches</b> keep realizing ZVS...|$|R
40|$|The three calculators {{and many}} {{peripherals}} of the 9800 Series {{are designed to}} handle the broadest possible range of applications. Flexibility and expandability are emphasized. By Richard M. Spangler N RECENT YEARS, programmable calculators I have taken on {{a large portion of}} the computation jobs that were previously handled by computers. Calculators have several advantages that are responsible for this trend. Calculators are small, selfcontained, and easily transported-they can be brought directly to the user’s desk. They are quiet, and fit easily into a laboratory or office environment. No complicated turn-on procedure is required; <b>the</b> user merely <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> power <b>switch,</b> and <b>the</b> calculator is ready. The most important advantage is a psychological one-calculators are “friendly. ” They are interactive, they provide immediate feedback and immediate answers, and they are dedicated to their user. The 9800 Series is a new line of powerful programmable calculators and an extensive set of calculator peripherals. The series is designed to cover a broad range of applications. Important objectives of the new series are to provide the user with a choice of calculators that are flexible and expandable, and to support those calculators with comprehensive applications software and peripherals. The new 9800 Series is the successor of the 9100 A/B 1, HP’s first programmable calculators. These earlier calculators were as powerful as the limits of technology at the time of their conception would allow them to be, But with technological advances come better calculators, hence the 980...|$|R
