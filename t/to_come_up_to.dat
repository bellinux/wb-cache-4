25|$|The Maniac, now impersonating Malipiero, finds Pissani and his lackey, the Constable, in {{the room}} where the anarchist was during his interrogation. Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was {{involved}} with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the office.|$|E

The remaining French ships had escaped seawards and eventually reached Toulon, while the British squadron consolidated their prizes and returned to Keith off Toulon. British losses in the engagement were one man killed and nine wounded, all on Success, while French losses were confined to Perrée alone, who died of his wounds in the evening. Perrée's death was met by a mixed response in the British squadron: some regretted his death as [...] "a gallant and capable man", while others considered him [...] "lucky to have redeemed his honour" [...] for violating his parole after being captured the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Although the A-10 {{can carry}} {{considerable}} disposable stores, its primary built-in weapon is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger autocannon. One {{of the most}} powerful aircraft cannons ever flown, it fires large depleted uranium armor-piercing shells. The GAU-8 is a hydraulically driven seven-barrel Gatling-type cannon designed specifically for the anti-tank role with a high rate of fire. The cannon's original design could be switched by the pilot to 2,100 or 4,200 rounds per minute; this was later changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rounds per minute. The cannon takes about half a second <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed, so 50 rounds are fired during the first second, 65 or 70 rounds per second thereafter. The gun is accurate enough to place 80 percent of its shots within a 40-foot (12.4 m) diameter circle from 4,000 feet (1,220 m) while in flight.

500|$|It is {{reported}} that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter.

Seeking the counsel of Demaratus, an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them [...] "the bravest men in Greece" [...] and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, [...] "there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defense." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "Improvements in studio {{technology}} meant that possibilities for shaping the sound {{after it has}} been recorded are almost limitless." [...] Such possibility were applied in the song composition and the remixes present in You Can Dance. Previously to change the sound of an instrument, or to jump from one sound to another, recordings used to stop playing the instrument and the drums at that point. But for the remixes on You Can Dance, the fade engineering technology was applied to the songs, wherein the fader was simply pulled down, and was pushed up again when the sound of the instruments were made <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the surface. The first song on the album is [...] "Spotlight" [...] which begins with the sound of drums, bass synths and handclaps, followed by Madonna uttering the words [...] "Spotlight, shine bright". After the first verse, the sound of keyboard is heard during the chorus. It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an interlude featuring vocal echoes, a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words [...] "Pa-da-pa-da-pappa pappa pa pa" [...] in the same melody. The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that [...] "everybody is a star" [...] and that if one wants to be famous and be under the [...] "spotlight", the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her. According to the sheet music published at SheetMusicPlus.com, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is set in the key of F major with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes of C5 to B5. [...] "Spotlight" [...] has a basic sequence of Am–C–Am–C–G–F as its chord progression.|$|E

2500|$|Processes during {{earthwork}} include excavation, {{removal of}} material to spoil, filling, compacting, construction and trimming. If rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed, moisture content is managed and replaced with standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements (generally 90-95% relative compaction). [...] Blasting is not frequently used to excavate the roadbed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal road base.

2500|$|Newer wood drying {{technologies}} {{have included the}} use of reduced atmospheric pressure to attempt {{to speed up the}} drying process. [...] A variety of vacuum technologies exist, varying primarily in the method heat is introduced into the wood charge. [...] Hot water platten vacuum kilns use aluminum heating plates with the water circulating within as the heat source, and typically operate at significantly reduced absolute pressure. [...] Discontinuous and SSV (super-heated steam) use atmosphere to introduce heat into the kiln charge. [...] Discontinuous technology allows the entire kiln charge <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> full atmospheric pressure, the air in the chamber is then heated, and finally vacuum is pulled. [...] SSV run at partial atmospheres (typically around 1/3 of full atmospheric pressure) in a hybrid of vacuum and conventional kiln technology (SSV kilns are significantly more popular in Europe where the locally harvested wood is easier to dry versus species found in North America). [...] RF/V (radio frequency + vacuum) kilns use microwave radiation to heat the kiln charge, and typically have the highest operating cost due to the heat of vaporization being provided by electricity rather than local fossil fuel or waste wood sources.|$|E
