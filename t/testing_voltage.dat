This paper present results of artificial ageing test of 22 kV XLPE cable for a distribution system application in Thailand. XLPE insulating material of 22 kV cable was sliced to 60 - 70 µm in thick and subjected to AC high voltage stress at 23 ◦C, 60 ◦C, 75 ◦C and 90 ◦C.

The preliminary experimental results from X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy suggest that the TiO 2 nanofibres were well-dispersed and interwoven by the CNTs, forming freestanding, bendable and light weighted composite. In comparison with TiO 2 nanofibre based LIBs, the CNTs could significantly improve the battery performance due to their high conductivity property and 3 D network morphology. In both 1 - 3 V and 0. 01 - 3 V <b>testing</b> <b>voltage</b> ranges, the as-prepared composites show excellent reversible capacity and capacity retention. The superior lithium storage capacity of the CNT/TiO 2 composite was mainly attributed to dual functions of the CNTs - the CNTs not only provide conductive networks to assist the electron transfer but also facilitate lithium ion diffusion between the electrolyte and the TiO 2 active materials by preventing agglomeration of TiO 2 nanofibres.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional linear power {{amplifiers}} (LPAs) show a high output voltage quality but {{are characterized by}} high power losses and/or low power density. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} interest in increasing the efficiency of LPAs, e. g., for the realization of high power <b>testing</b> <b>voltage</b> sources. In this paper, a high-frequency isolated boost-type tracking power supply (TPS) system is proposed for the conditioning of the input voltage of an LPA. The output voltage of the TPS is varied according to the voltage to be formed by the LPA so that the voltage drop across the power amplifier output transistors is reduced to low values. This results in a significant increase of the total system efficiency. The operating principle of the proposed system is described. A design method for the output filter using the power supply rejection ratio of the LPA is proposed. This method ensures that the ampli-fier output voltage has minimal switching frequency components. Furthermore, a control system design method is presented that ensures good performance in the control of the constant inductor current of the switch-mode tracking stage. Finally, the theoretical considerations are verified by measurements on a 1 -kW laboratory prototype.

40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} about voltage dips and short voltage interruptions, generally named as voltage events, which origin in power supply networks {{and have a}} negative influence for all connected electric appliances. In this thesis single phase appliances are considered. These problems closely relate with area of electromagnetic compatibility which solve all questions about correct operation {{of different types of}} electric appliances during electromagnetic disturbances impact. Voltage events are ones of the many types of electromagnetic disturbances. The connection between disturbance sources and sensitive electric appliances is created by power supply lines. The immunity of electric appliances to voltage dips and short interruptions is currently tested via voltage dips with strictly defined parameters which are intended by class of electromagnetic environment in which the usage of electric appliance is recommended. During immunity tests the rectangular shape of voltage dips is preferred. The main descriptive parameters of <b>testing</b> <b>voltage</b> events are the residual voltage and the event time duration. But voltage dips and short interruptions defined by this way do not closely relate with parameters of real voltage dips and interruptions occurred in public supply system where parameters of voltage dips are variable. Moreover in the power supply system there are many of others voltage parameters which can have a significant influence to immunity level of connected electric appliances. This Ph. D. thesis also deals with finding more voltage event parameters. Although the voltage events occurrence in the power supply system is not limited and voltage events are considered only as informative voltage parameter it is important to monitor voltage events occurrence. The monitoring device {{has to be able to}} operate for ling time period and it has to detect parameters of voltage events with adequate accuracy. The accuracy of detected event parameters and the detection delay depends on the detection algorithm characteristics. That is why the part of this thesis relates with a comparison of several detection algorithms and their abilities to correct detection of voltage event parameters. The main purpose of this thesis is the proposal of connection between classification of voltage dips and short interruptions occurred in power supply system with the classification of electric appliances immunity to these voltage events. On the base of many of provided electric appliances immunity tests and also on the base of long time period voltage events monitoring the special compatibility levels are proposed in this thesis.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of integrating various renewable energy recourses in power system requires {{extensive use of}} power electronic solutions, such as HVDC and FACTS, as these techniques allow energy conversion between different frequencies and serves to stabilize the network. Consequently, electric stresses other than traditional 50 / 60 Hz sinusoidal voltage stress are acting on high voltage insulation materials. Therefore, a need for fast and accurate characterization methods, {{which can be used}} to study the influence on insulation materials of different types of voltage waveforms, has arisen. Dielectric response measurement is one commonly used non-destructive insulation test technique and has more than 100 years of history. Limitations like precision of the <b>testing</b> <b>voltage</b> waveform, high demand on a stable testing environmental condition, intricate specimen-electrode preparation, severe electrode geometric influences, etc., are however restraining the use of such measurements. In this project, several methods that are based on the Arbitrary Waveform Impedance Spectroscopy (AWIS) technique have been developed to enable fast and more accurate solid dielectric characterization. A test setup that is based on the AWIS technique can be optimized by implementing several techniques such as voltage divider, voltage follower, shielding box, etc., to reduce the measurement noise and to avoid crosstalk between adjacent signals. By utilizing optimized harmonic limited waveforms in the AWIS test setup, dielectric responses over a wide frequency spectrum can be determined simultaneously without degradation by signal aliasing. This also enables monitoring of the dielectric properties under fast changing test conditions as a source of systematic error is eliminated when all frequencies are obtained {{at the same time and}} at the same conditions. An air reference method and a contact-free electrode arrangement are described in this work to enhance the dielectric characterization accuracy by avoiding contact problems at the electrodes. It is shown that by performing a calibration with electrode gap filled with air under the same conditions as the material is tested, the air reference method can improve the measurement accuracy substantially. This type of approach also eliminates the need of a detailed model of the analog measurement circuit. In conjunction with the contact-free measurements, the approach allows for avoiding complicated and time-consuming specimen preparation procedures. The measurement methodology as well as the electrode arrangement and error estimation are presented and evaluated using different dielectric response instruments and materials. To improve the accuracy of dielectric permittivity, two methods are suggested in this work by either compensating or shielding the electrode setup from undesired geometric influences. One approach is to estimate a correction factor from a finite element method (FEM) model to improve the accuracy. The other approach uses a shielding guard electrode to avoid the geometric influence on measurement. Measurements of several PET films are used as an example to illustrate the use of correction factors in the application of contact free measurement. The latter method is only verified in FEM calculation...|$|E
