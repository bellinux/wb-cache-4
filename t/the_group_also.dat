The natural parents of <b>the</b> black/black <b>group</b> <b>also</b> averaged a year less of education than those of <b>the</b> black/white <b>group,</b> which suggests an average difference between <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> in intellectual ability. There were also significant differences between the adoptive families of black/black and black/white children in father's education and mother's IQ.|$|R

5|$|A {{budget was}} {{prepared}} by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) in December 1989, and in April 1990, the Parliament of Norway passed a grant. In October, LOOC and Gjøvik Municipality made an agreement to share the ownership of the venue.

In preparation for construction, drilling samples were taken and sent to SINTEF and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute for testing.
