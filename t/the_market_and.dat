5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was. Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 32,400 coins {{on which}} Morgan {{had tried to}} keep a higher relief were struck in January 1922.

The new low-relief coins, which Fraser accepted on behalf of the Commission, though under protest, were given limited production runs in Philadelphia in early February. When the results proved satisfactory, San Francisco began striking its first Peace dollars using the low-relief design on February 13, with Denver initiating production on February 21, and Philadelphia on February 23. The three mints together struck over 84million pieces in 1922.|$|E
5|$|By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable {{market had}} {{developed}} {{on the south}} side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become a well-known red-light district. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.|$|E

5|$|During the 1870s ice {{began to}} be used by Timothy Eastman, of the Bell Brothers firm, to {{transport}} American meat to Britain; the first shipment successfully arrived in 1875 and by the following year 9,888 tons (8,909,000kg) of meat was shipped. The chilled meat was retailed through special warehouses and stores. There was concern in Britain that chilled American meat might flood <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> harm domestic farmers, but the exports continued. The rival Chicago-based meat firms of Armour and Swift entered the refrigerated meat transport market in the late 1870, establishing their own fleet of refrigerator cars, network of icing stations and other infrastructure, increasing the sales of chilled Chicago beef to the eastern seaboard from 15,680 tons (14,128,000kg) a year in 1880, to 173,067 tons (155,933,000kg) in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England (1066–1071), Norwich was radically redesigned. Norwich Cathedral was built {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Tombland and much of the old town to the southwest of Tombland was cleared for the motte of Norwich Castle. A new Norman town was built west of the Castle, in an area known as Mancroft. The new town at Mancroft included a market of its own to provide for the Norman settlers and merchants moving into the area, and possibly also to supply the castle's garrison. The exact date of the foundation of the market at Mancroft is not recorded, but it is known to have been operational by the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086. Granting the right to trade in Norman England {{was a part of the}} Royal Prerogative and, as with most fairs and markets of the period, the market at Mancroft was operated under licence from the King. The King's Clerk had jurisdiction over all trade conducted at <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> tolls and rents were collected on behalf of the King.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E

All lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses' decision that letters (championed by Azaz) and numbers (by the Mathemagician) were equally important. They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air, and since then, the land has had neither Rhyme nor Reason.|$|E
