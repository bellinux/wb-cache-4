5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older.</b> This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E

25|$|Square Dancing in the UK {{has seen}} {{diminishing}} numbers of dancers since the 1990s as the activity {{has failed to}} attract sufficient numbers of younger dancers.

25|$|Referring to the {{original}} 50 workers, nuclear researcher Dr. Eric Hall opined that they were likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older,</b> and unlikely to have further children, so {{the long-term effects of}} exposure to high-levels of ionizing radiation {{would be less likely to}} appear before a natural death. Some younger workers were injured and young Osaka firefighters were operating at the site.

25|$|Existing {{low-cost}} units tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older</b> {{than the}} housing stock in general. For example, in 1995, 68% of the affordable rental housing stock was constructed before 1970 and another 21% were built before 1980. A considerable {{share of the}} older affordable rental stock {{has been removed from}} the market since 1995, but many of the remaining units are in older buildings. Due for example to differences in building standards, technical development and historical maintenance, the older building stock is generally of worse quality than newer buildings. Deficits include cold down draft, poor insulation and inefficient windows and appliances.|$|E
25|$|Florence was {{governed by}} a council called the signoria, which {{consisted}} of nine men. The head of the signoria was the gonfaloniere, who was chosen every two months in a lottery, as was his signoria. To be eligible, one had to have sound finances, no arrears or bankruptcies, he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older</b> than thirty, {{had to be a}} member of Florence's seven main guilds (merchant traders, bankers, two clothe guilds, and judges). The lottery was often pre-determined, and the results were usually favourable to influential families. The roster of names in the lottery were replaced every five years.|$|E

25|$|In {{many respects}} the {{composition}} of lenticular galaxies is like that of ellipticals. For example, they both consist of predominately older, hence redder, stars. All of their stars are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older</b> than about a billion years, in agreement with their offset from the Tully–Fisher relation (see below). In addition to these general stellar attributes, globular clusters are found more frequently in lenticular galaxies than in spiral galaxies of similar mass and luminosity. They also have little to no molecular gas (hence the lack of star formation) and no significant hydrogen α or 21-cm emission. Finally, unlike ellipticals, they may still possess significant dust.|$|E
25|$|It {{is in the}} gospels, however, {{that the}} analogy between the Latin Vulgate and the Syriac Vulgate can be {{established}} by evidence. If the Peshitta {{is the result of}} a revision as the Vulgate was, then we may expect to find Old Syriac texts answering to the Old Latin. Such texts have actually been found: three texts have been recovered, all showing divergences from the Peshitta, and believed by competent scholars <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older</b> than it, and therefore better translations for use in text criticism. These are, to take them in the order of their recovery, (1) the Curetonian Syriac, (2) the Syriac of Tatian's Diatessaron, and (3) the Sinaitic Syriac.|$|E

25|$|Both Atlamál and Atlakviða are {{referred}} to as Greenlandic poems in the Codex Regius. Most scholars believe Atlakviða <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older</b> than the Norse colony in Greenland and reject a Greenlandic origin for that poem. Atlamál, on the other hand, is believed to be of an age consistent with composition in Greenland. Moreover, some aspects of the poem itself are suggestive of Greenland. In particular one of Kostbera's ominous dreams has a realistic description of a polar bear. The grim tone of the poem is also consistent with what is known of the Greenland settlement. The relatively mean conditions of the chieftains in the poemthe Niflungar, for example, have only 10 retainershave also been taken as strengthening the case for an origin in Greenlandic culture.|$|E
25|$|With {{her father}} {{losing his job}} in the mid 1930s, the Great Depression caused {{financial}} difficulties for the family. As a result, the three sisters entered show business as vaudeville performers to support the family. They began touring in Canada and the United States. Collectively, they were known as The Three Brodels. As an attempt to bypass child labor laws at the time, both Mary and Joan pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>older</b> than they were. When Leslie was nine, she told child labor investigators that she was 16 years old. Joan {{proved to be the}} scene stealer of the three sisters because of her impersonations of figures such as Katharine Hepburn, Maurice Chevalier, and Jimmy Durante. Coming from a family of Irish ancestry, Leslie was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Catholic schools in Detroit, Toronto, and Montreal.|$|E
25|$|The {{basement}} {{is thought}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Older</b> North American basement, {{especially in the}} North, {{and a number of}} different accreted terranes, which are mostly covered by Cenozoic volcanism. The northern extent of the Sierra Madre is the Cortés Terrane, although the northern extreme of this contains {{a small portion of the}} Carborca Terrane. Some of the northern end may also be underlain by a Precambrian basement placed around the same time as the Grenville Orogeny. Some of this area has a series of Paleozoic sedimentary sequences from a deep marine environment underlying it, which considered by some to be part of the Cotes Terrane and by others to be transported. In some areas distinct sedimentary rocks can be identified by shallow-water Silurian and Mississippian sedimentary rocks underlying deep-water Pennsylvanian and Permian, which are divided by Mississippian rhyolite. The Permian clastics contain some detrital rock that sit alongside low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks with serpentinite.|$|E

5000|$|The {{invention}} of tradition {{is a concept}} made prominent in the eponymous 1983 book edited by British Marxist intellectual E. J. Hobsbawm and T. O. Ranger. In their Introduction the editors argue that many [...] "traditions" [...] which [...] "appear or claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>old</b> <b>are</b> often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented." [...] They distinguish the [...] "invention" [...] of traditions in this sense from [...] "starting" [...] or [...] "initiating" [...] a tradition which does not then claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>old.</b> The phenomenon <b>is</b> particularly clear in the modern development {{of the nation and}} of nationalism, creating a national identity promoting national unity, and legitimising certain institutions or cultural practices.|$|R
