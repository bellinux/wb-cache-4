50|$|MVVM {{facilitates}} {{a separation}} of development of the graphical user interface - be it via a markup language or GUI code - from development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model). <b>The</b> <b>view</b> model of MVVM is a value converter, meaning <b>the</b> <b>view</b> model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model {{in such a way}} that objects are easily managed and presented. In this respect, <b>the</b> <b>view</b> model is more model than view, and handles most if not all of <b>the</b> <b>view's</b> display logic. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> model may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by <b>the</b> <b>view.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{degree of}} logic {{permitted}} in <b>the</b> <b>view</b> varies among different implementations.

The presenter then retrieves data from <b>the</b> <b>view</b> through methods defined by <b>the</b> <b>view</b> interface. Finally, <b>the</b> presenter operates on the model and updates <b>the</b> <b>view</b> with <b>the</b> results of the operation. Other versions of model-view-presenter allow some latitude with respect to which class handles a particular interaction, event, or command. This is often more suitable for web-based architectures, where <b>the</b> <b>view,</b> which executes on a client's browser, {{may be the best}} place to handle a particular interaction or command.|$|R
