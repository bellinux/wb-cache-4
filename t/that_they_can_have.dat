5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E

This infuriates Poppy, who storms over to the Minute Mart and confronts Denise, leading to the two women clashing in the shop. Poppy then returns home and tells Fatboy that she has forgiven him, but she needs to move away from Walford so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a fresh start.

25|$|As of 2013 {{there have}} been only two films in which James Bond falls in love with the Bond girl. The first was On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), in which Countess Tracy di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg) marries Bond but is shot dead by Irma Bunt and Ernst Stavro Blofeld at the story's end. The second was Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) in Casino Royale (2006). Bond confesses his love to her and resigns from MI6 so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a normal life together. He later learns that she had been a double agent working for his enemies. The enemy {{organisation}} Quantum had kidnapped her former lover and had been blackmailing her to secure her co-operation.

25|$|Within the novels, {{opponents of}} the Culture {{have argued that the}} role of humans in the Culture is nothing more than that of pets, or parasites on Culture Minds, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> nothing {{genuinely}} useful to contribute to a society where science is close to omniscient about the physical universe, where every ailment has been cured, and where every thought can be read. Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) wondering how far-reaching the Minds' dominance of the Culture is, and how much of the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and Special Circumstances influence other societies. Also, except for some mentions about a vote over the Idiran-Culture War, and the existence of {{a very small number of}} 'Referrers' (humans of especially acute reasoning), few biological entities are ever described as being involved in any high-level decisions.|$|E

According to Nadeska Alexis of MTVs Rapfix, Brown sings in a falsetto tone, which she found to be reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush described the ballad as [...] "very Michael Jackson and neo-Bieber".

2500|$|A lucid dream may {{be defined}} as {{one in which the}} dreamer is aware {{that he or she is}} asleep and dreaming. [...] The term ‘lucid dream’ was first used by the Dutch {{physician}} Frederik van Eeden, who studied his own dreams of this type.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{in a dispute}} between {{supporters}} of the adequacy of natural selection and those who held for inheritance of acquired characteristics, {{one of the arguments}} made repeatedly by Herbert Spencer, and followed by others, depended on what Spencer referred to as co-adaptation of co-operative parts, as in: [...] "We come now to Professor Weismann's endeavour to disprove my second thesis — {{that it is impossible to}} explain by natural selection alone the co-adaptation of co-operative parts. It is thirty years since this was set forth in [...] "The Principles of Biology."

2500|$|Modern {{pathology}} {{began to}} develop as a distinct field of inquiry during the 19th Century through natural philosophers and physicians that studied disease and the informal study of what they termed “pathological anatomy” or “morbid anatomy”. [...] However, pathology as a formal area of specialty was not fully developed until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{with the advent of}} detailed study of microbiology. In the 19th century, physicians had begun to understand that disease-causing pathogens, or [...] "germs" [...] (a catch-all for disease-causing, or pathogenic, microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae, molds, protists, and prions) existed and were capable of reproduction and multiplication, replacing earlier beliefs in humors or even spiritual agents, that had dominated for much of the previous 1,500 years in European medicine. [...] With the new understanding of causative agents, physicians began to compare the characteristics of one germ’s symptoms as they developed within an affected individual to another germ’s characteristics and symptoms. This realization led to the foundational understanding that diseases are able to replicate themselves, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> many profound and varied effects on the human host. To determine causes of diseases, medical experts used the most common and widely accepted assumptions or symptoms of their times, a general principal of approach that persists into modern medicine.|$|E
