5|$|On June 27, <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> East closed, and {{the band}} were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys {{initially}} refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that the Allman Brothers would be closing the show, and they were free to leave if they disagreed. The Allman Brothers' performance was used for additional tracks when an expanded version of At Fillmore East, <b>The</b> <b>Fillmore</b> Concerts, was reissued on CD.|$|E
5|$|Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West is a live double album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. It was {{recorded}} on April 10, 1970, at <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> West in San Francisco, {{shortly after the}} release of the trumpeter's Bitches Brew album and the recording of Jack Johnson (1971). Black Beauty was produced by Teo Macero, Davis' longtime record producer.|$|E
5|$|Band of Gypsys is a live album by Jimi Hendrix and {{the first}} without his {{original}} group, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. It was recorded on January 1, 1970, at <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> East in New York City with Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, frequently {{referred to as the}} Band of Gypsys. The album mixes funk and rhythm and blues elements with hard rock and jamming, an approach which later became the basis of funk rock. It contains previously unreleased songs and was the last full-length Hendrix album released before his death.|$|E

5|$|Black Beauty was {{recorded}} on April 10, 1970, at <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> West in San Francisco, when Davis performed as the opening act for the Grateful Dead. It was also {{soon after his}} studio album Bitches Brew had been released to stores, and he played some songs from the album while leading an ensemble that featured soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman, bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira. After the departure of saxophonist Wayne Shorter from the group earlier that year, Grossman was enlisted by Davis {{to participate in an}} April 7 recording session for his next album Jack Johnson (1971) before joining the live band.|$|E

Her father was a teacher and football coach in <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> Unified School District before becoming vice principal and eventually superintendent of the district. Kemp's Biblical Literature professor, Keith Beebe, presided over the wedding, after which Kemp converted to his wife's Presbyterian faith.

5|$|The {{tour was}} a success and Deep Purple's {{popularity}} in the US received another boost from a TV appearance at Playboy After Dark alongside Hugh Hefner on 23 October 1968. The band had become a much requested act and more dates were added on the East Coast {{till the end of}} the year, including a two nights gig at <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> East with Creedence Clearwater Revival and the James Cotton Blues Band, and Christmas holiday shows at the famous Electric Circus club in New York.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, while Los Angeles {{was known}} for locking and Fresno {{was known for}} popping, several other cities in Northern California had their own local funk styles. Sacramento was known for a style called sac-ing, San Jose for dime stopping, and Oakland for snake hitting. The San Francisco crew Granny and Robotroid {{incorporated}} stepping moves and JROTC rifle drill movements in their dancing to make a unique funk style called Fillmore strutting. This dance was named after <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> district in San Francisco where Granny and Robotroid were from. Granny and Robotroid performed on the Gong Show in 1976. Although strutting had exposure on national television, it (and {{the rest of the}} localized funk styles) faded and never became mainstream.|$|E
5|$|Ray Davies {{travelled}} to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, {{opening up}} an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> East and Whisky a Go Go.|$|E
25|$|Within {{days of the}} album's release, Vestine {{left the}} group after an on-stage blow up at <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> West between himself and Larry Taylor.

The new lineup played two dates at <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> before {{appearing}} at Woodstock in mid-August.|$|E

It {{was followed by}} Happy Trails, released in early 1969 and largely recorded live at <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> East and <b>the</b> <b>Fillmore</b> West. Like most live albums of the time, Happy Trails made extensive use of studio overdubs, and the last two songs were recorded entirely in the studio, but it has nonetheless been called the most accurate reproduction of the band's acclaimed live performances. Happy Trails was awarded a gold album in the United States.|$|E
