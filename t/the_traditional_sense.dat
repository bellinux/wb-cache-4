40|$|Accurate {{displacement}} sensing or estimation is {{an important}} task for reliably assessing the condition of civil infrastructure such as bridges and buildings, because the structural displacement describes {{the behavior of a}} structure and indicates structural safety according to the design limit. However, it is difficult to directly measure the displacement of a bridge structure due to the inaccessibility of a reference point especially when bridges are built over a highway, a river or the sea. As an alternative, an indirect displacement estimation using two different types of measurements such as strain and acceleration (i. e., multimetric data) has been developed. While the approach has been seen as promising, the combination of <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> system based on wired sensors and the multimetric data-based algorithm is inappropriate or impractical in real-world applications of the approach. This paper proposes a new displacement sensing system by incorporating wireless sensor technology with the multimetric data-based algorithm, which can address the difficulties and issues found in <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> system to realize a practical means of measuring displacement in full-scale bridges. The proposed wireless displacement sensing system enables (a) time-synchronized acceleration and strain measurement, (b) high-precision strain sensing and (c) improved applicability due to the wireless communication as well as the previous two features. The effectiveness of the proposed system is experimentally verified in laboratory and full-scale experiments. close 0...|$|R
5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>sense</b> of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it {{has been dominated by}} a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
5|$|Mutiny of the Matoika is {{the common}} name for the events in July 1920 {{involving}} {{a large portion of}} the Olympic team of the United States while on board the U.S. Army transport ship , headed to Antwerp for the 1920 Summer Olympics. Princess Matoika was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War, the American Olympic Committee (AOC) members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later. The event was not a mutiny in <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>sense,</b> but has been called that since the mid-1930s.|$|E

5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>sense</b> of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new {{wireless}} sensing network {{paradigm is}} presented for structural monitoring applications.

Furthermore, <b>the</b> mobile-agent provides computation power to make near real-time assessments on the structural conditions. This paper will discuss such prototype systems, which are used to interrogate impedance-based sensors for structural health monitoring applications. Our wireless sensor node is specifically designed to accept various energy sources, including wireless energy transmission, and to be wirelessly triggered on an as-needed basis by the mobile-agent or other sensor nodes.
