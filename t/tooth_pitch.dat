It must thus {{have an even}} number of poles, but this must not be divisible by four. Practical rotors use six poles. As the rotation of one <b>tooth</b> <b>pitch</b> is sufficient to generate one AC cycle, the output frequency is thus {{the product of the}} rotation speed (in revs. per second) and the number of rotor teeth. Early AC systems used the standard frequency of 400 Hz, which limited alternators to two pole rotors and a maximum rotation speed of 24,000 rpm. The use of higher frequencies, from multi-pole rotors, was already recognised as a future means to achieve greater power for the same weight. The Sea Slug missile alternator used a speed of 24,000 rpm to produce 1.5 kVA of electricity at 2,400 Hz.|$|E
5000|$|A bandsaw (also written band saw) is a {{saw with}} a long, sharp blade {{consisting}} of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or more wheels to cut material. They are used principally in woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering, but may cut a variety of materials. Advantages include uniform cutting action {{as a result of}} an evenly distributed tooth load, and the ability to cut irregular or curved shapes like a jigsaw. The minimum radius of a curve is determined by the width of the band and its kerf. Most bandsaws have two wheels rotating in the same plane, one of which is powered, although some may have three or four to distribute the load.

50|$|To {{efficiently}} wind {{the pole}} shoes lying close together of electronically commutated multipole three-phase motors, {{they will be}} coated with insulation and directly wound with the needle winding method. A needle with a nozzle that is placed at a right angle to the direction of movement travels in a lifting motion passing the stator packs through the groove channel between the two neighboring poles of the motor to drop the wire in the desired place. The stator is then turned at the reversal point on the winding head by one <b>tooth</b> <b>pitch</b> so that the previous process can run again in reverse order. With this winding technology a specific layer structure can be realized. The disadvantage is {{that there must be}} a clearance between two adjacent poles with a size of at least the nozzle diameter. The nozzle diameter is about three times the diameter of the winding wire. The space between two adjacent poles can therefore not be filled completely.|$|E

Structure and operation principle of the MAL-FSPM are analyzed. Cogging torque model of the MAL-FSPM is established. The characteristics of cogging torque and torque ripple are investigated for: (1) distance (dend) between left end of rotor and left end of stator is more than two rotor <b>tooth</b> <b>pitch</b> (τp); and (2) dend is less than two rotor <b>tooth</b> <b>pitch.</b> Cogging torque {{is an important component}} of torque ripple and the period ratio of the cogging torque to the back electromotive force (EMF) equals one for the MAL-FSPM before optimization.

40|$|The {{inspection}} {{of each individual}} tooth element of a spur gear wheel can be a tedious and expensive process. Two methods of composite gear testing are available, namely, the single flank rolling gear test and the dual flank rolling gear test. The first method is well documented, but the dual flank system tends to have been neglected, few papers being available on the subject. As a preliminary stage to {{the investigation into the}} dual flank testing technique two methods of pitch error measurement using ball ended contact probes are examined. These are :(i) the direct measurement of cumulative pitch measurement using a single contact probe and dividing arrangement and(ii) the span gauging of adjacent teeth, commercial measuring equipment being used in both cases. The two methods are compared theoretically in terms of the maximum cumulative pitch error of a gear, and their probable accuracy of measurement compared with the allowable pitch tolerances quoted in the relevant British Standard.

40|$|Annular seals are devices used in {{turbomachinery}} {{to avoid}} flow losses which reduce efficiency. The dynamic {{stability of the}} machine is also improved by the seal. Thus, {{it is an important}} subject to understand the flow behavior through the seal. Straight through triangular labyrinth seals {{are one of the most}} commonly used types of non-contacting annular seals. The energy dissipation through these seals is achieved by a series of teeth and cavities. As the flow passes above each tooth, a portion of its pressure energy is converted into kinetic energy. A portion of this kinetic energy is dissipated through turbulence-viscosity interaction in the cavity that follows. Moreover, some portion of the pressure energy is also lost through viscosity of the fluid. This research aims to understand the effects of flow parameters and seal geometry on these losses. This will make it possible to estimate the mass flow leakage through the seal. ANSYS Fluent is used to simulate the flow through the seal. The effect of seal geometry is studied by varying clearance, <b>pitch,</b> <b>tooth</b> height, tooth width and upstream side angle. It was found that, amongst other geometrical parameters, <b>tooth</b> clearance and <b>pitch</b> has a strong influence on carryover coefficient. Smaller values of c/s have better kinetic energy dissipation in the cavity. Carryover coefficient is also found to be a function of the Reynolds number and shaft speed. Discharge coefficient of the seal presents the overall efficiency while carryover coefficient only shows the cavity performance. Discharge coefficient is also found to be a strong function of <b>tooth</b> clearance, <b>pitch,</b> Reynolds number and shaft speed. Remaining parameters have smaller effects. It was observed that the discharge coefficient of first tooth is always lower than those of intermediate teeth. The compressibility effects are presented by using an expansion factor which is the ratio of compressible flow discharge coefficient to incompressible flow discharge coefficient. It was found that the expansion factor is fairly independent of geometrical parameters but a strong function of flow parameters. Considering the effects of seal geometry and flow parameters on carryover coefficient, discharge coefficient and expansion factor, the seal geometry is optimized to increase the kinetic energy dissipation and pressure head loss which in turn will reduce the mass flow leakage...|$|R
