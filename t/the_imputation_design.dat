40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{analyzing}} a series of independent cross-sectional surveys in which some questions are not answered in some surveys and some respondents do not answer {{some of the questions}} posed. The method is also applicable to a single survey in which different questions are asked, or different sampling methods used, in different strata or clusters. Our method involves multiply-imputing the missing items and questions by adding to existing methods of <b>imputation</b> <b>designed</b> for single surveys a hierarchical regression model that allows covariates at the individual and survey levels. Information from survey weights is exploited by including in the analysis the variables on which the weights were based, and then reweighting individual responses (observed and imputed) to estimate population quantities.

In this paper, we address the data sparsity problem in the neighbourhood-based CF methods by proposing an Adaptive-Maximum <b>imputation</b> method (AdaM). <b>The</b> basic idea is to identify an imputation area that can maximize <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> benefit for recommendation purposes, while minimizing <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> error brought in. To achieve <b>the</b> maximum <b>imputation</b> benefit, <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> area is determined from both the user and the item perspectives; to minimize <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> error, {{there is at least}} one real rating preserved for each item in <b>the</b> identified <b>imputation</b> area.

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{imputation}} {{is frequently}} used {{to deal with}} missing data in healthcare research. Although {{it is known that}} the outcome should be included in <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> model when imputing missing covariate values, it is not known whether it should be imputed. Similarly no clear recommendations exist on: the utility of incorporating a secondary outcome, if available, in <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> model; <b>the</b> level of protection offered when data are missing not-at-random; the implications of the dataset size and missingness levels. Methods We used realistic assumptions to generate thousands of datasets across a broad spectrum of contexts: three mechanisms of missingness (completely at random; at random; not at random); varying extents of missingness (20 – 80 % missing data); and different sample sizes (1, 000 or 10, 000 cases). For each context we quantified the performance of a complete case analysis and seven multiple imputation methods which deleted cases with missing outcome before imputation, after imputation or not at all; included or did not include the outcome in <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> models; and included or did not include a secondary outcome in <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> models. Methods were compared on mean absolute error, bias, coverage and power over 1, 000 datasets for each scenario. Results Overall, there was very little to separate multiple imputation methods which included the outcome in <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> model. Even when missingness was quite extensive, all multiple imputation approaches performed well. Incorporating a secondary outcome, moderately correlated with the outcome of interest, made very little difference. The dataset size and the extent of missingness affected performance, as expected. Multiple imputation methods protected less well against missingness not at random, but did offer some protection. Conclusions As long as the outcome is included in <b>the</b> <b>imputation</b> model, there are very small performance differences between <b>the</b> possible multiple <b>imputation</b> approaches: no outcome imputation, imputation or imputation and deletion. All informative covariates, even with very high levels of missingness, should be included in <b>the</b> multiple <b>imputation</b> model. Multiple imputation offers some protection against a simple missing not at random mechanism...|$|R
