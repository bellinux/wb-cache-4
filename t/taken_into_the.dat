5|$|Emden {{departed}} Pillau on 1 February, {{bound for}} Kiel.

British bombers attacked the ship twice and damaged her badly. The ship was listing heavily, and so on 14 April, she was towed out into Heikendorfer Bay and run aground. The Germans then blew her up on 3 May to prevent the Allies from capturing the ship. The wreck was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1949.

By the 1930s, local magistrates expressed concern about the tower and the risk that it might fall over onto the grounds of a neighbouring private asylum, the Kent Sanatorium, endangering the patients.

5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances are <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are {{moved from the}} cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5|$|In {{other parts}} of Canterbury, the city walls became used for promenades by the more fashionable citizens. The Dane John Gardens were built between 1790 and 1803 by Simmons in the {{south-east}} corner of the walls, remodelling the old castle motte, and incorporating the Roman bank and the medieval wall-walk into the design. The ownership of the land was disputed, and the park was <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> control of the city shortly after its construction.|$|E
5|$|It was {{maintained}} throughout the 15th century, {{and played a}} role in Kett's Rebellion of 1549, when the rebels attacked Norwich, deploying artillery and damaging the tower's parapets. Repairs to the tower's walls in the late 19th century inadvertently caused long-term damage, and in 1953 it was <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> guardianship of the Ministry of Works, who stabilised its condition in a five-year conservation project. In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof of the building have been lost.|$|E

It does not appear that FitzOsbern built a castle on the St Briavels site, however, and the revolt of FitzOsbern's son, Roger de Breteuil resulted in the village being <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> possession of the royal bailiffs of the Forest of Dean.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{approaches for}} sequences clustering and classification. These approaches use the self organizing map “SOM”. The inputs {{of the map}} are modelled in order to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account <b>the</b> information and the correlation of the patterns contained in the sequences. The first approaches represent the input of the map by a representative vector or by a covariance matrix in order to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account <b>the</b> correlations between the sequence components. These approaches do not <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account <b>the</b> temporal order in the sequences (the dynamics). The other approaches introduce the dynamics in the covariance matrix. When covariance matrices represent sequences, the SOM is modified in order to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account <b>the</b> fact that the inputs are matrices. The experimentations show that our approaches are better than some other temporal self organizing maps for user Web navigation classification...|$|R
