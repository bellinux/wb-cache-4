But even for major eruptions, the ash clouds remain only for relatively short periods.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} to erupt in games McGraw managed. During a brawl <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> {{during a game}} against the Detroit Tigers on August 21, 1901, McGinnity spat on umpire Tom Connolly. McGinnity was arrested for the incident and permanently suspended by AL president Ban Johnson, who wanted there to be no fighting in AL games. Johnson later cut the suspension down to 12 days after McGinnity apologized. McGinnity compiled a 26–20 record for the 1901 Orioles, and his 48 games, 39 complete games, and 382 innings pitched led the AL.|$|E

5|$|The two-year truce was now {{close to}} expiry and the Lombards asked the Byzantines {{to respect the}} {{alliance}} which had been established between them. The Emperor found an excuse to break the new alliance with the Gepids by claiming they had again ferried Slav raiders. He put together an army with renowned commanders in its ranks such as Germanus' sons Justin and Justinian, Aratius, the Herulian Suartuas, and Amalafrid, brother-in-law of Audoin.

He saw action in the Sabinada between 1837 and 1838, followed by the Ragamuffin War from 1840 until 1844. In 1849, after spending two years in Great Britain, Inhaúma was given command of the fleet that was instrumental in subduing the Praieira revolt, the last rebellion in imperial Brazil.|$|E
5|$|As a {{manufacturing}} center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> into widespread violence, {{known as the}} Pittsburgh Railway Riots.

Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.|$|E

5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle of growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, phonolite, basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around vents. Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Xuân Lộc had been {{entrusted}} to the 18th ARVN Division, {{reinforced by the}} 8th Regiment of the 5th Division, the 3rd Armored Brigade, two Ranger and two artillery battalions, and the 81st Airborne Ranger Group. The week-long fighting <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> on 8 April raged in and around Xuân Lộc and became the most significant engagement of the entire offensive. The initial attack was conducted by the 341st and 3rd North Vietnamese Divisions, which attacked headlong into the town, a tactic widely used before, hoping to quickly rout the defender. However, they had to call off the attack after meeting 2 weeks of heavy resistance and effective fire support which cost them dearly. The attackers were then reinforced by the 7th Division.|$|E

5|$|The colonial {{venture into}} modernity brought {{concepts}} of democracy, equality and individual rights. The {{rise of the}} concept of nationalism and introspection of discriminatory practices brought about social reform movements related to caste and gender relations. This first phase of feminism in India was initiated by men to uproot the social evils of sati (widow immolation), to allow widow remarriage, to forbid child marriage, and to reduce illiteracy, as well as to regulate the age of consent and to ensure property rights through legal intervention. In addition to this, some upper caste Hindu women rejected constraints they faced under Brahminical traditions. However, efforts for improving the status of women in Indian society were somewhat thwarted by the late nineteenth century, as nationalist movements emerged in India. These movements resisted 'colonial interventions in gender relations' particularly in the areas of family relations. In the mid to late nineteenth century, there was a national form of resistance to any colonial efforts made to 'modernise' the Hindu family. This included the Age of Consent controversy <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> after the government tried to raise the age of marriage for women.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E
25|$|A popular way of {{classifying}} magmatic volcanoes is {{by their}} frequency of eruption, with those <b>that</b> <b>erupt</b> regularly called active, those <b>that</b> have <b>erupted</b> in historical times but are now quiet called dormant or inactive, and those <b>that</b> have not <b>erupted</b> in historical times called extinct. However, these popular classifications—extinct in particular—are practically meaningless to scientists. They use classifications which {{refer to a}} particular volcano's formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes, which was explained above.|$|R

5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Pope Pius IX had been {{personally}} {{involved in the}} decision to remove Mortara from his parents—whether he had been or not was debated extensively in the press—what is certain is that he was greatly surprised by the international furore <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> over the matter, and promptly adopted the position that to return the baptised child to his non-Christian family would be totally incompatible with Church doctrine. As foreign governments and the various branches of the Rothschild family one by one condemned his actions, Pius IX stood firm on what he saw as a matter of principle. Those angered included Emperor Napoleon III of France, who found the situation particularly vexing as the pontifical government owed its very existence to the French garrison in Rome. Napoleon III had indifferently supported the Pope's temporal rule because it enjoyed widespread support among French Catholics; the scandal over Mortara weakened this considerably and, according to the historian Roger Aubert, provided the final straw that changed French policy. In February 1859 Napoleon III concluded a secret pact with the Kingdom of Sardinia pledging French military support for a campaign to drive the Austrians out and unify Italy—most of the pontifical domain would be absorbed along with the Two Sicilies and other minor states.|$|E
5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova <b>that</b> <b>erupted</b> on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.|$|E
