5|$|Ruffs were {{formerly}} trapped {{for food}} in England in large numbers; on one occasion, 2,400 were served at Archbishop Neville's enthronement banquet in 1465. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> netted while lekking, sometimes being fattened with bread, milk and seed in holding pens before {{preparation for the}} table.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> hunted by {{settlers}} on Réunion, {{who also}} kept them as cagebirds. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling {{was reported to}} be in decline by the early 19th century, and was probably extinct before the 1860s. A number of factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{folklore}} {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last to seek shelter before a hurricane, {{and the first}} to emerge afterwards. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> thus a symbol for danger and optimism.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>is</b> Gone: A Manifesto is {{a murder}} mystery by Stephen Graham Jones. It was {{published}} in 2005 by Fiction Collective 2. <b>The</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>is</b> Gone: A Manifest is Jones' third novel.|$|R
50|$|The fabulous {{qualities of}} <b>the</b> oozlum <b>bird</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of a}} poem by W. T. Goodge (1862-1909). In the poem <b>The</b> Oozlum <b>Bird,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to fly {{backwards}} and has the singular ability {{of being able to}} fly up in the air while letting the earth turn under it. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to be large enough to bear the weight of a man.|$|R
5|$|Since 1972, BGH {{provides}} {{ground-handling services}} for all airports in Bangladesh; {{the company reported}} a profit of BDT4.5billion for the FY 2011–12. The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC {{was set up in}} 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman's profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Dragon Air, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another profit-making subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 and put into operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird flu was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> culled. This was the first incident of bird flu in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> a {{food and}} fuel source for early European settlers, {{and are now}} farmed, in Australia and elsewhere, for their meat, oil and leather. Commercial emu farming started in Western Australia around 1970. The {{commercial}} industry {{in the country is}} based on stock bred in captivity, and all states except Tasmania have licensing requirements to protect wild emus. Outside Australia, emus are farmed on a large scale in North America, with about 1million birds in the US, Peru, and China, {{and to a lesser extent}} in some other countries. Emus breed well in captivity, and are kept in large open pens to avoid the leg and digestive problems that arise from inactivity. They are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing, and are slaughtered at 15 to 18months.|$|E
5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>was</b> MacLeod’s {{first major}} public art commission, and is {{situated}} in Vancouver British Columbia. Partially inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's film <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> (1963), <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>is</b> a large sculpture of two house sparrows, <b>birds</b> that <b>are</b> not indigenous to British Columbia. This sculpture challenges the idea of place and impossibility.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bird</b> lays eggs {{moderately}} well, {{compared to}} other birds of similar proportions. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> also primarily reared for meat. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> used for cockfighting {{but this is no}} longer practised in Britain. However, many other countries continue with cockfighting, and Old Oxford English Game is commonly used.|$|R
5|$|It {{was once}} {{suggested}} {{that the relationship between}} the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been {{suggested that the}} depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their droppings. Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, puffin numbers {{increased}} considerably {{in the late}} twentieth century in the North Sea, including on the Isle of May and the Farne Islands where numbers increased by about 10% per year. In the 2013 breeding season, nearly 40,000 pairs were recorded on the Farne Islands, a slight increase on the 2008 census and on the previous year's poor season when some of the burrows flooded. This number is dwarfed by the Icelandic colonies with five million pairs breeding, the Atlantic puffin being the most populous bird on the island. In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland's puffins breed, <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a thirty-year ban on hunting was put in place. When stocks recovered, a different method of harvesting was used and now hunting is maintained at a sustainable level. Nevertheless, a further hunting ban covering the whole of Iceland was called for in 2011, although the puffin's lack of recent breeding success was being blamed on a diminution in food supply rather than overharvesting. Since 2000, a sharp population decline has been seen in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands and Greenland. A similar trend has been seen in the United Kingdom, where an increase in 1969-2000 appears to have been reversed. For example, the Fair Isle colony was estimated at 20,200 individuals in 1986, but it had been almost halved by 2012. Based on current trends, it is estimated that the European population will decline by 50-79% between 2000 and 2065.|$|E
25|$|On Orkney, Scotland, sea eagle bones {{have been}} found in 6000-year-old burial mounds, among them the Tomb of the Eagles, {{suggesting}} that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> revered by the prehistoric people there, a belief strengthened by the Pictish stone carvings of sea eagles from Orkney.|$|E

50|$|The Salvadorian Magpie <b>is</b> a <b>bird</b> {{found in}} Jamaica. It {{is not related}} to El Salvador, but the word that means thin winged in Latin. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> black and has yellow eyes. In the sun it appears that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> a dark blue.|$|R
50|$|When an {{infection}} <b>is</b> confirmed, all <b>birds</b> at <b>the</b> affected farm are destroyed per USDA guidelines. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> culled by pumping an expanding water-based foam {{into the barn}} houses, which suffocates them within minutes. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> then composted, usually at the location.|$|R
25|$|The famous adda of `The Birds`or {{popularly known}} as `pakkhir adda` started within the {{vicinity}} of Mukherjee family's ancestral premises. <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> famous for there long standing association or affinity with Ganja, Charas and Guli. They camoflouged their presence as various types of birds as according {{to the level of}} intoxication.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggested}} function, {{based on}} observation of blue jays, {{is that the}} bird makes the insects edible, by discharging the harmful acid onto their feathers. <b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> found to show anting behaviour only if the ants had a full acid sac, and with subjects whose acid sacs had been experimentally removed, the behaviour was absent.|$|E
25|$|Producer Kathryn Jeffs and {{cameraman}} Paul Stewart travelled to {{the remote}} Gaoligongshan mountains in western Yunnan {{and after a}} three-hour trek to a ridge overlooking the forest, managed to film a troop of bear macaques feeding on fruits in the canopy. A second sequence showing white-eared pheasants at a rarely seen lek was ruined when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> disturbed.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} homing {{experiments}} with pigeons {{to determine the}} influence of topographical features on the orientation behavior of <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> discussed. <b>The</b> releases and following were conducted by ground experiments in which <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> tracked by visual observation at points of topographical interest and the helicopter method by which <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> tracked throughout <b>the</b> entire flight. The ground experiments showed a strong influence of topographical features on initial orientation. The helicopter experiments showed that the ground experiments do not provide adequate information on the manner in which homing occurs...|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, {{allegations}} of improper care of the birds by the Southeastern Raptor Rehabilitation Center were leveled by the university administration and by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Many of <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> suffering from diseases and malnourishment. After all investigations were concluded, War Eagle VI was allowed to fly again prior to Auburn home games.|$|E
25|$|Parrots {{on display}} here include red-vented cockatoos, lesser sulphur-crested cockatoos, red-and-blue lories, yellow-backed {{chattering}} lories, Mount Apo lorikeets and blue-and-yellow macaws.

25|$|The parapet walks are corbelled, as is an {{oriel window}} in the south gable. A {{projecting}} garderobe was also added on the west wall in the 19th century. Within the outer face of the north gable is a dovecot, formerly accessed via a timber walkway from a high-level door. The chimney runs behind the pigeon holes, ensuring <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> kept warm in winter.|$|E
40|$|There are no recent {{confirmed}} {{sightings of}} this species within the European region. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> formerly bred on the Iberian peninsula, and it was last recorded in 1981. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> therefore classified as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) within the Europe and the EU 27 regions, although <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> considered Least Concern globally (BirdLife International 2012) ...|$|R
50|$|A common urban legend {{holds that}} <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> {{depicted}} <b>are</b> herons. In 2008, {{representatives from the}} Danish Ornithological Society stated {{that this is not}} true and that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> in fact storks.|$|R

25|$|The next {{significant}} {{event was}} on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, {{and more than}} 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve birds were killed and the remainder scattered before any more could be killed. No more birds were sighted that day.|$|E
25|$|The ability {{could also}} be {{acquired}} by tasting dragon blood. According to the Poetic Edda and the Völsunga saga, Sigurd accidentally tasted dragon blood while roasting the heart of Fafnir. This gave him the ability to understand the language of birds, and his life was saved as <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> discussing Regin's plans to kill Sigurd. Through the same ability Áslaug, Sigurd's daughter, found out the betrothment of her husband Ragnar Lodbrok, to another woman.|$|E
25|$|Wormsley Park {{operates}} as an organic farm. The area {{is known for}} its population of red kites. Once extinct in England and Scotland, <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> reintroduced into England beginning in 1989. The area was not originally planned to be the first release site. It was originally intended to be Windsor Great Park, but at the last minute the landowner pulled out and the project nearly collapsed. Getty stepped in and offered Wormsley Park as an alternative, thus saving the project.|$|E
