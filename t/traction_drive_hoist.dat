40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{designing}} and sizing of a Multiple-Input Power Electronic Converter (MIPEC) {{to be used}} in an electric vehicle propulsion system that includes a fuel cell (FC) generator and a combined storage unit. The combined storage unit is composed by an ultracapacitors tank (UC) and a battery unit (BU). MIPEC is responsible for power-flow management on-board the vehicle for each mode of operation. Specifications for MIPEC designing come out from many considerations concerning <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> and reference driving cycle, on-board power source and storage unit characteristics. However, to date sizing and configuration of both storage units and on-board generators are directly related to <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> and driving profile (i. e. vehicle performances and characteristics) and no relation with power electronic interface is considered during preliminary design. Then, power electronic interface is selected in order to fit <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> requirements with power source and storage unit characteristics; as a consequence converter mode of operation lacks of optimization, as well dynamic behavior and efficiency cannot be maximized.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. Due to finite oil {{resources}} {{and its political}} and economical impact, {{a renewed interest in}} energy independence has compelled industry and government to pursue electric vehicle designs. The current worldwide research that is being conducted on drivetrain topologies for EVs, focus mainly on direct in-wheel drive, direct differential drive and fixed-gear differential drive topologies. Furthermore, the control strategy for these type of motor drives require a, so called, field-weakening operation in order to achieve acceptable performance characteristics for the vehicle. This thesis evaluates the use of a manual gearbox drivetrain topology and a radial flux air-cored permanent magnet (RFAPM) synchronous machine, without flux-weakening operation, as a <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> application for EVs.
