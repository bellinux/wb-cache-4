The presence of <b>this</b> <b>sound</b> in Pipil, an orginal language already spoken in El Salvador before the Spaniards arrived, favored its maintenance in Salvadoran Spanish. Since Pipil is a language in extinction, some authors believe that <b>this</b> <b>sound</b> is also disappearing in Salvadoran Spanish. However, Pipil {{is not the only}} language with <b>this</b> <b>sound</b> that influences Salvadoran Spanish. Thus, we examine the linguistic distribution of <b>this</b> <b>sound</b> in El Salvador, the possible reasons of its maintenance and its implications for Spanish phonology in general...|$|R

500|$|Thomas's verbal style {{played against}} strict verse forms, {{such as in}} the villanelle [...] "Do not go gentle into that good night". His images were {{carefully}} ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud. Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas {{wrote in a letter to}} Glyn Jones: [...] "My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy".|$|E

Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?"

The Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, known as the Temple of Italian Glories for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history, has a plaque commemorating Fermi. In 1999, Time named Fermi on its list of the top 100 persons of the twentieth century. Fermi was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th-century [...] physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally. The historian of physics, C. P.

A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know <b>this</b> <b>sounds</b> ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit.

I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it."
