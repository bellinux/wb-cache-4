Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims are experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body.

5|$|Awake {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Isaacs), a detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car crash. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the collision, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Michael passes out during a bungee jump while he is at a carnival with Rex and Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). He is unable to switch realities, consistently hallucinates and realizes <b>that</b> <b>Ed</b> Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), a detective who is working with Michael's former partner Bird (Steve Harris), was attempting to kill him in the crash. Meanwhile, Hannah deals with Emma's new baby by trying to convince her parents to let her keep the baby.|$|E
5|$|Megan's lawyer ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) {{arrives at}} Megan's work, needing {{forensic}} testing for evidence {{that his client}} Manny Santos (Carlos Apostle), is a juvenile. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) greets him, and she asks Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) to help examine him. Curtis finds evidence which suggests Manny has received recent trauma to ribs and other body parts, suggesting that he’s being abused. Curtis explains to Todd that Manny is a juvenile, but {{he will not be}} able to be released back to his former home, as he is being abused there. Meanwhile, the evidence for the murderer fits a partial match to Mike, so Megan concludes <b>that</b> <b>Ed</b> is not Mike's father. She goes to visit Jen; however she slams the door in her face. Megan walks into her house and finds Mike's real father Tim (Timothy Devlin), holding Ed's and Jen's baby daughter hostage. Tim takes Jen into the garden when the police arrive, so Bud shoots him in the leg and arrests him and Jen is reunited with Sophie and Mike.|$|E

40|$|Mood and {{emotions}} are intrinsically involved with eating. The question is {{in what ways}} do these normal emotional relations with food contribute to, or shed light on, the development of abnormal relations with food that eventually become clinical eating disorders (EDs). This chapter discusses basic mechanisms, findings, and models that help {{our understanding of the}} interactions between eating {{and emotions}}, in both clinical and nonclinical populations. The finding that comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders is the norm among patients with <b>EDs</b> suggests <b>that</b> <b>EDs</b> may not necessarily be restricted to domains of eating behavior and body image but may also be associated with significant difficulties in affective functioning. This chapter reviews the evidence relating to the notion <b>that</b> <b>EDs</b> are disturbances of mood regulation, in which regulatory strategies specifi cally related to eating and the body are used to diminish negative affect associated with food, body image, or stress...|$|R

40|$|Spatially disaggregate Enumeration District (ED) {{level data}} for London {{is used in}} an {{analysis}} of various area-wide factors on road casualties. Data on 15335 EDs was input into a geographic information system (GIS) that contained data on road characteristics, public transport accessibility, information of nearest hospital location, car ownership and road casualties. Demographic data for each ED was also included. Various count data models e. g., negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial models were used to analyze the associations between these factors with traffic fatalities, serious injuries and slight injuries. Different levels of spatial aggregation were also examined to determine if this affected interpretation of the results. Different pedestrian casualties were also examined. Results suggest that dissimilar count models may have to be adopted for modeling different types of accidents based on the dependent variable. Results also suggest <b>that</b> <b>EDs</b> with more roundabouts are safer than EDs with more junctions. More motorways are found to be related to fewer pedestrian casualties but higher traffic casualties. Number of households with no car seems to have more traffic casualties. Distance of the nearest hospital from EDs tends to have no significant effect on casualties. In all cases, it is found <b>that</b> <b>EDs</b> with more employees are associated with fewer casualties. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} team {{were concerned that}} older patients requiring emergency admission seemed to wait longer for a hospital bed, and as such were disproportionately affected by Emergency Department overcrowding. To investigate this theory and explore any changes over time, a ten year dataset (2005 - 2014 inclusive) was extracted from the information systems at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. This research examines the changing age profile of ED patients, identifies the relationship between age and the total {{time spent in the}} Emergency Department (Patient Experience Time (PET)), and examines the public belief <b>that</b> <b>EDs</b> are busiest in winter when reports of overcrowding and elderly patients waiting on trolleys get most media attention. The results highlight <b>that</b> the <b>ED</b> is busy all year round (but for different seasonal reasons) and point to an overdue need to plan for the current and future healthcare of older patients within and beyond acute hospitals...|$|R

25|$|The ED was {{preceded by}} the Jemdet Nasr and then succeeded by the Akkadian period, during which, {{for the first time}} in history, large parts of Mesopotamia were united under a single ruler. The {{entirety}} of the ED is now generally dated to approximately 2900–2350 BC according to the middle chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the short chronology. The ED was divided into the ED I, ED II, ED IIIa, and ED IIIb sub-periods. ED I–III were more or less contemporary with the Early Jezirah (EJ) I–III in Upper Mesopotamia. The exact dating of the ED sub-periods varies between scholars: with some abandoning ED II and using only Early ED and Late ED instead, and others extending ED I while allowing ED III begin earlier so <b>that</b> <b>ED</b> III were to begin immediately after ED I, with no gap between the two.|$|E

Ed realizes that Christopher has read the letters and cleans him up. He then confesses that he had indeed lied about Judy's death and also that it was he who killed Wellington, stating that it was a mistake resulting from his anger after a heated argument with Mrs Shears. Christopher, having lost all trust in his father and fearing <b>that</b> <b>Ed</b> might try to kill him since he had already killed the dog, decides to live with his mother and runs away.

25|$|Sheriff Masterson got {{his term}} {{off to a}} roaring start on February 1, 1878, by {{capturing}} Dave Rudabaugh and Ed West, who were wanted for an attempted train robbery. Two more of the train robbers were caught by Bat and brother Ed on March 15, but the tandem law-enforcement effort {{came to an abrupt}} end when 25-year-old City Marshal Edward J. Masterson was shot and killed {{in the line of duty}} on April 9, 1878. Ed was shot by a cowboy named Jack Wagner, who was unaware <b>that</b> <b>Ed</b> Masterson's brother Bat was in the vicinity. As mortally wounded Ed stumbled away from the scene, Bat Masterson responded from across the street with deadly force, firing on both Wagner and Wagner's boss Alf Walker, who was holding a gun. Wagner died the next day, but Walker was taken back to Texas and recovered. The local newspapers were ambiguous about who shot Wagner and Walker, and this led some later historians to question whether Bat Masterson was involved. However, the rediscovery of two court cases in which Bat Masterson testified under oath that he had shot both men adds credence to the idea that Bat avenged his brother. More violence followed on October 4, 1878, when a variety actress named Dora Hand, known professionally as Fannie Keenan, was shot and killed by James Kenedy, son of the wealthy Texas cattleman Miflin Kenedy (1818–1895). Sheriff Masterson's posse, which included Wyatt Earp and Bill Tilghman, captured Kenedy the following day after Bat used his rifle to shoot him in the left arm, and other posse members killed his horse.|$|E
