5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause <b>thrombophlebitis</b> than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} IV vancomycin include: local pain, {{which may be}} severe, and <b>thrombophlebitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Complications, while rare, include venous thromboembolism, visual disturbances, {{allergic}} reaction, <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> skin necrosis, and hyperpigmentation or a red treatment area.|$|E
25|$|The caustic {{nature of}} {{vancomycin}} makes IV therapy using peripheral lines a risk for <b>thrombophlebitis.</b> Ideally, central lines or infusion ports should be used.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the risk}} of endotoxemia, {{laminitis}} is a potential complication for horses suffering from colitis, and may become the primary cause for euthanasia. Horses are also at increased risk of <b>thrombophlebitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mutations in factor XII {{have been}} {{associated}} with an asymptomatic prolongation in the clotting time and possibly a tendency toward <b>thrombophlebitis.</b> Other mutations have been linked with a rare form of hereditary angioedema (type III) essentialism.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{following}} a <b>thrombophlebitis</b> contracted {{while he was}} in Budapest, Yashin underwent the amputation of one of his legs. He died in 1990 of stomach cancer, despite a surgical intervention in an attempt to save his life. He was given a state funeral as a Soviet Honoured Master of Sport.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the weather improved, but {{thoughts}} of attempting the summit were quickly abandoned when Art Gilkey collapsed just outside his tent. Houston diagnosed him as suffering from <b>thrombophlebitis</b> - blood clots which would be dangerous at sea level, but would almost certainly be fatal at 7800m. The whole team was now forced into {{a desperate attempt to}} save him. While they believed that there was little or no chance of saving him, the possibility of abandoning him was never discussed. However, the unacceptable avalanche risk followed by a renewal of the storm prevented a descent at that time, and the team remained at Camp VIII for several more days {{in the hope that the}} weather would improve.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons between orally {{administered}} {{pill and}} transdermal patch suggests that when estrogens are taken orally {{the risks of}} <b>thrombophlebitis</b> and pulmonary embolism are increased, an effect which is not seen with topical administration. Transdermal and transvaginal administration {{are not subject to}} first pass metabolism, and so lack the anabolic effects that oral therapy has on hepatic synthesis of Vitamin K dependent clotting factors. This effect refers only to patches for post menopausal hormone replacement, which contain estradiol, not those used in oral contraceptive therapy, which contain ethinylestradiol. The latter is associated with an increased incidence of venous clot. The WHI also showed an increased incidence arterial disease, namely stroke, in patients who began HRT after the age of 65, although this effect was not significantly present in those who began therapy during their fifth decade.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Schuckardt {{joined the}} Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima, a group devoted to {{spreading}} {{the message of}} Our Lady of Fátima. In 1961, Schuckardt was stricken with typhoid; this {{was the beginning of}} a long succession of illnesses. He was in and out of a coma for eight days. He experienced a remarkable recovery which he attributed to the intercession of the Virgin Mary. In January 1963, he was hospitalized with <b>thrombophlebitis</b> of the legs. The illness reversed itself to which Schuckardt again attributed to a miracle resulting from a promise he made to Our Lady of Fatima, promising her that he would use his legs to travel and spread her message. He gained considerable fame as a charismatic speaker for the Blue Army and was elected to its International Council in 1963 at the age of 26. Schuckardt was the only member of the Council who was not a national chairman. He was subsequently appointed to the position of International Secretary.|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E

500|$|People {{sometimes}} have recent onset of atypical {{type 2 diabetes}} {{that is difficult to}} control, a history of recent but unexplained blood vessel inflammation caused by blood clots (<b>thrombophlebitis)</b> known as Trousseau sign, or a previous attack of pancreatitis. A doctor may suspect pancreatic cancer when the onset of diabetes in someone over 50 years old is accompanied [...] by typical symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal or back pain, indigestion, vomiting, or fatty feces. Jaundice accompanied by a painlessly swollen gallbladder (known as Courvoisier's sign) may also raise suspicion, and can help differentiate pancreatic cancer from gallstones.|$|E

2500|$|The {{process has}} similar risks to {{other forms of}} phlebotomy. [...] Bruising of the arm from the needle {{insertion}} is the most common concern. [...] One study found that less than 1% of donors had this problem. [...] A number of less common complications of blood donation are known to occur. [...] These include arterial puncture, delayed bleeding, nerve irritation, nerve injury, tendon injury, <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> and allergic reactions.|$|E
2500|$|The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists {{reports that}} in the past, the main {{concerns}} of exercise in pregnancy were focused on the fetus and any potential maternal benefit {{was thought to be}} offset by potential risks to the fetus. However, they write that more recent information suggests {{that in the}} uncomplicated pregnancy, fetal injuries are highly unlikely. [...] They do, however, list several circumstances when a woman should contact her health care provider before continuing with an exercise program: vaginal bleeding, dyspnea before exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, muscle weakness, preterm labor, decreased fetal movement, amniotic fluid leakage, and calf pain or swelling (to rule out <b>thrombophlebitis).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% {{of those}} {{treated with the}} drug) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and metallic taste in the mouth. Intravenous administration is commonly associated with <b>thrombophlebitis.</b> Infrequent adverse effects include: hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, vomiting, glossitis, stomatitis, dark urine, and paraesthesia. High doses and long-term systemic treatment with metronidazole {{are associated with the}} development of leucopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system toxicity. [...] Common adverse drug reaction associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness and skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes). Metronidazole has been associated with cancer in animal studies.|$|E
2500|$|Complications of {{benzodiazepine}} abuse include drug-related deaths due to overdose {{especially in}} combination with other depressant drugs such as opioids. Other complications include: [...] blackouts and memory loss, [...] paranoia, violence and criminal behaviour, risk-taking sexual behaviour, foetal and neonatal risks if taken in pregnancy, [...] dependence, withdrawal seizures and psychosis. Injection of the drug carries risk of: <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> deep vein thrombosis, deep and superficial abscesses, pulmonary microembolism, rhabdomyolysis, tissue necrosis, gangrene requiring amputation, hepatitis B and C, [...] as well as blood borne infections such as HIV infection (caused by sharing injecting equipment). Long-term use of benzodiazepines can worsen pre-existing depression and anxiety and may potentially also cause dementia with impairments in recent and remote memory functions.|$|E
2500|$|Health {{professionals}} see orthomolecular medicine as encouraging {{individuals to}} dose themselves with {{large amounts of}} vitamins and other nutrients without conventional supervision, which they worry might be damaging to health. Potential risks of inappropriate vitamin and supplement regimes include {{an increased risk of}} coronary heart disease, hypertension, <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, neurological effects, liver toxicity, congenital abnormalities, spontaneous abortion, gouty arthritis, jaundice, kidney stones, and diarrhea. In their book Trick or Treatment?, Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh conclude that [...] "The concepts of orthomolecular medicine are not biologically plausible and not supported by the results of rigorous clinical trials. These problems are {{compounded by the fact that}} orthomolecular medicine can cause harm and is often very expensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vancomycin is {{recommended}} {{to be administered}} in a dilute solution slowly, over at least 60 min (maximum rate of 10mg/min for doses >500mg) due to {{the high incidence of}} pain and <b>thrombophlebitis</b> and to avoid an infusion reaction known as the [...] "red man syndrome" [...] or [...] "red neck syndrome". This syndrome, usually appearing within 4 to 10min after the commencement or soon after the completion of an infusion, is characterized by flushing and/or an erythematous rash that affects the face, neck, and upper torso. These findings are due to interaction of vancomycin with MRGPRX2, a GPCR mediating IgE-independent mast cell degranulation. Less frequently, hypotension and angioedema may also occur. Symptoms may be treated or prevented with antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, and are less likely to occur with slow infusion.|$|E
2500|$|Contraindications of {{progesterone}} include hypersensitivity to progesterone or progestogens, {{prevention of}} cardiovascular disease (a Black Box warning), <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> thromboembolic disorder, cerebral hemorrhage, impaired liver function or disease, breast cancer, reproductive organ cancers, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, missed menstruations, miscarriage, or a history of these conditions. Progesterone should be used with caution in people with conditions that may be adversely affected by fluid retention such as epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, cardiac dysfunction, and renal dysfunction. It should also be used with caution in patients with anemia, diabetes mellitus, a history of depression, previous ectopic pregnancy, venereal disease, and unresolved abnormal Pap smear. Use of progesterone is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, the drug has been deemed usually safe in breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but {{should not be used}} during the first four months of pregnancy. Some progesterone formulations contain benzyl alcohol, and this may cause a potentially fatal [...] "gasping syndrome" [...] if given to premature infants.|$|E
2500|$|Sinus {{infection}} {{can spread}} through anastomosing veins or by direct extension to close structures. Orbital complications were categorized by Chandler et al. into five stages {{according to their}} severity (see table). Contiguous spread to the orbit may result in periorbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital cellulitis, and abscess. Orbital cellulitis can complicate acute ethmoiditis if anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins <b>thrombophlebitis</b> enables {{the spread of the}} infection to the lateral or orbital side of the ethmoid labyrinth. Sinusitis may extend to the central nervous system, where it may cause cavernous sinus thrombosis, retrograde meningitis, and epidural, subdural, and brain abscesses. Orbital symptoms frequently precede intracranial spread of the infection [...] Other complications include sinobronchitis, maxillary osteomyelitis, and frontal bone osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone often originates from a spreading thrombo-phlebitis. A periostitis of the frontal sinus causes an osteitis and a periostitis of the outer membrane, which produces a tender, puffy swelling of the forehead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombophlebitis</b> causes include {{disorders}} {{related to}} increased tendency for blood clotting and reduced speed {{of blood in}} the veins such as prolonged immobility; prolonged traveling (sitting) may promote a blood clot leading to <b>thrombophlebitis</b> but this occurs relatively less. High estrogen states such as pregnancy, estrogen replacement therapy, or oral contraceptives are associated with an increased risk of <b>thrombophlebitis.</b> Specific disorders associated with <b>thrombophlebitis</b> include superficial <b>thrombophlebitis</b> which affects veins near the skin surface, deep venous thrombosis which affects deeper veins, and pulmonary embolism. Those with familial clotting disorders such as protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, or factor V Leiden are also at increased risk of <b>thrombophlebitis.</b> <b>Thrombophlebitis</b> can be found in people with vasculitis including Behçet's disease. <b>Thrombophlebitis</b> migrans can be a sign of malignancies such as pancreatic carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombo{{phlebitis}}</b> is phlebitis or vein inflammation {{related to}} a thrombus, which is a blood clot. When it occurs repeatedly in different locations, it is known as <b>thrombophlebitis</b> migrans, (migrating <b>thrombophlebitis)</b> indicated by the Trousseau sign of malignancy.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{symptoms or}} signs are {{often associated with}} <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> although <b>thrombophlebitis</b> is not restricted to the veins of the legs.|$|E
50|$|Phlebitis or venitis is the {{inflammation}} of a vein, {{usually in the}} legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. Phlebitis often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called <b>thrombophlebitis</b> or superficial <b>thrombophlebitis.</b> Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial <b>thrombophlebitis</b> will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombophlebitis</b> occurs almost equally {{between women}} and men, though males do have a {{slightly}} higher possibility. The average age of developing <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> based on analyzed incidents, is 54 for men and 58 for women.|$|E
50|$|Superficial <b>thrombophlebitis</b> is a {{thrombosis}} and {{inflammation of}} superficial veins which presents as a painful induration with erythema, {{often in a}} linear or branching configuration forming cords. Superficial <b>thrombophlebitis</b> is due to inflammation and/or thrombosis, and less commonly infection of the vein. It is generally a benign, self-limited disorder, however, it can be complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and even pulmonary embolism (PE). Migratory superficial <b>thrombophlebitis</b> is known as Trousseau's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|When {{the initial}} {{presentation}} is swelling and increased temperature in a leg, {{the differential diagnosis}} includes <b>thrombophlebitis.</b> It {{may be necessary to}} do both a bone scan and a venogram to differentiate between heterotopic ossification and <b>thrombophlebitis,</b> and it is even possible that both could be present simultaneously. In heterotopic ossification, the swelling tends to be more proximal and localized, with little or no foot/ankle edema, whereas in <b>thrombophlebitis</b> the swelling is usually more uniform throughout the leg.|$|E
