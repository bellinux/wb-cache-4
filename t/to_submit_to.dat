5|$|In {{the next}} match, Chris Benoit faced A-Train. Both men {{wrestled}} inconclusively {{in the early}} stages of the match, until Benoit performed a dragon screw legwhip on A-Train and forced A-Train <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> the Sharpshooter to win.|$|E
5|$|Although Alcuin had scorn for Æthelhard for fleeing Canterbury, {{the papacy}} saw it differently. Pope Leo III praised Æthelhard for fleeing and refusing <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> Eadberht, whom Leo {{compared}} to the later Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. There are indications, though, that the Kentish community considered electing another archbishop while Æthelhard was in exile.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, a Victims' Rights Amendment {{was added}} to the Virginia Bill of Rights as §8-A. In Nobrega v. Commonwealth, the only case so far to {{interpret}} this amendment, the Virginia Supreme Court used the Victims’s Rights Amendment to support its ruling that an alleged rape victim could not be compelled <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> a psychiatric evaluation.|$|E
5|$|In January 1858, Powell {{was elected}} to the United States Senate. In April of that year, President James Buchanan {{appointed}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch commissioners to negotiate settlements with the Mormons in Utah. On arriving in Utah, Powell and McCulloch issued a proclamation by President Buchanan offering clemency to Mormons who agreed <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> Federal authority. The offer was accepted, and violence was averted.|$|E

5|$|In {{late spring}} 1345 however, Kantakouzenos, {{reinforced}} with allegedly 20,000 troops from Aydin under their ruler Umur Bey, marched against Momchil. Momchil tried {{to prevent this}} by asking again for pardon and offering <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> Kantakouzenos, but the emperor refused to heed him.|$|E

Cena {{attempted}} an FU on Jericho but Jericho countered the {{move into a}} Codebreaker for a near-fall. Cena executed an FU on Jericho for a near-fall.

25|$|In Alleyne v. United States, Case #: 11-935 (2013), the Court {{ruled that}} all facts that {{increase}} a mandatory minimum must be <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> and proven by a jury. In this ruling, the court explicitly overruled Harris v. United States (2002), which had held that such facts {{did not need}} <b>to</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> a jury.|$|R
5|$|To {{solve these}} {{problems}} Michael Palaeologus began consolidating his rule; he had the younger co-emperor John IV blinded, which resulted in much resentment. To counter this, the Byzantine Emperor installed a new Patriarch of Constantinople, Germanus III, ordering him to lift an excommunication that had been placed against him by the former Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos and <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> the authority of Rome in order to alleviate the Latin threat.|$|E
5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, {{even the first}} four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|After Henry of Anjou's {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of England as Henry II in 1154, Foliot persuaded the Earl of Hereford <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> the new king's demand that he return the custody of certain royal castles to the king. In the summer of 1160, Foliot wrote to Pope Alexander III, whom the king had just recognised as pope instead of Alexander's rival, Victor IV, intimating that the canonisation of King Edward the Confessor, which had been delayed by Alexander's predecessor Innocent II, might be warranted {{as a reward for}} Henry's recognition of Alexander.|$|E

5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} in the United States, McCarthyism was at its height, {{generating}} fear and suspicion of entertainment industry figures, academics, military figures, and government officials by accusing them of real or suggested links to communist activities. The TSO was required <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> United States immigration authorities all the names of its musicians and other staff who would be accompanying the tour. The immigration department approved visas for all but seven musicians, suspecting them of communist activities. One of the musicians was later cleared, leaving six musicians who were denied entry.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{with this}} state of affairs {{continued}} to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but abdicated.|$|E

5|$|Fuad Pasha advised Karam {{to pursue}} and capture Shahin, while the British consul communicated {{his desire to}} see Karam restore the Khazens to their former {{position}} in Keserwan. Shahin ultimately reconciled with Karam on 12 April under the mediation of the French general Charles de Beaufort. Shahin agreed <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> the Qaimaqamate's authority without conditions. Later in 1861, Shahin relinquished the republic that he established in Keserwan. Subsequent to his retirement from politics, Shahin served as a judicial official in Rayfoun. There, in 1895, he died in relative obscurity. He left no memoirs {{about his role in}} the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{was sent}} to the Lovelace Clinic and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to undergo {{extensive}} physical examinations and <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> a battery of psychological tests. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue when it was determined that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space. On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
