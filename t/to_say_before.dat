500|$|The jury retired at 6:15pm on {{the fifth}} day and {{returned}} at 7:30pm to give its verdict of guilty for each of the five defendants. When asked if they had anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentence was passed, several of the convicted men made a closing speech. Allen stated his innocence, and that he regretted the death of Sergeant Brett, but that he was prepared to [...] "die proudly and triumphantly in defence of republican principles and the liberty of an oppressed and enslaved people".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{a violent}} {{criminal}} named John Mosley (Michael Kelly) is also {{searching for the}} Beacon. After killing one of Olivia's mentors, Mosley kidnaps and tortures Peter {{to find out the}} location. After he recovers the beacon from the grave of Robert Bishop, John Mosley is taken down by Olivia. The beacon escapes into the earth, and The Observer reports that its departure was [...] "on schedule." [...] Peter confronts The Observer about the beacon, only to have a gibberish conversation that implies that the Observer knows what Peter is going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> he says it, or, as Peter puts it, [...] "he knew me [...] he was inside my head." [...] The Observer then knocks Peter out with an advanced sort of stun gun.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have done}} you many injuries, but I never {{intended}} this. I am sorry for it. Have you anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me <b>before</b> I go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must take}} care of yourself," [...] she said briefly. [...] "Come, {{there are some things}} which I wish <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you <b>before</b> Antoinette is ready." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked by}} the judge whether he had {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentence was imposed, Cherry motioned to the prosecutors and stated: [...] "This whole bunch lied {{all the way through}} this thing [...] I told the truth. I don't know why I'm going to jail for nothing. I haven't done anything!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The jury deliberated {{for just}} {{two and a}} half hours before {{returning}} with a verdict finding Thomas Edwin Blanton guilty of four counts of first-degree murder. When asked by the judge whether he had anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentence was imposed, Blanton simply said: [...] "I guess the Lord will settle it on Judgment Day." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{trial in}} the Victorian Supreme Court lasting twelve sitting days Ryan was convicted {{of the murder of}} Hodson and sentenced to death by Justice John Starke, the {{mandatory}} sentence at that time. Asked if he had anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> sentencing Ryan stated [...] "I still maintain my innocence. I will consult with my counsel with a view to appeal. That is all I have to say!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blanche {{is getting}} ready to go out with me. We mean to have a walk together. I have many things <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her. <b>Before</b> we go, I have {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|GEORGE. For God's sake be just! I've {{come here}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> certain things. If you force me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> them <b>before</b> him--on your head be it! Will you appoint somewhere else? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Goot. There is times, my lofe, to be funny. There is also {{times to}} be grave. It is grave-times now. I have my last word <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you <b>before</b> I go." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although (as {{noted in}} the {{following}} sub-section) {{the greater part of}} the print-run of the first edition was said to have been lost in a shipwreck, the Monarquía indiana was known in Mexico as early as 1624 when it was first cited in a book published there in that year. [...] Between then and 1714 (that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>before</b> the second edition) it was cited, even copiously on occasion, by at least eleven authors in works published for the most part in Mexico, but also in Madrid and Guatemala.|$|E
2500|$|The reunion {{between the}} Doctor and Rose in the 2008 episode [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] is stated by {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Confidential to be {{a parody of}} romantic film conventions, because the heightened emotional content is abruptly interrupted by the Doctor being shot by a Dalek. In the next episode, [...] "Journey's End", Rose challenges the Doctor {{to say what he}} didn't get <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before,</b> to which he replies, [...] "Does it need saying?" [...] His half-human duplicate, however, does whisper it into Rose's ear, {{and the two of them}} kiss; Rose gets an emphatically romantic resolution to her romance storyline, as the duplicate-Doctor and Rose continue to live together on a parallel Earth. Gardner commented in Confidential that although the audience cannot hear, it is obvious that he is saying [...] "I love you". David Tennant stated that Rose was the Doctor's girlfriend, though it was never explicitly stated on screen.|$|E
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> the 2017 UK general election {{that she would be}} willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a {{few words}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you <b>before</b> you go," [...] said Mr. Acton, pausing {{with his hand on}} the bell, Monday afternoon, when the hour came for dismissing school.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} a {{difficult}} matter, and I'm not prepared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> myself. <b>Before</b> I {{make up my}} mind I should like it to happen again." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{would have}} ended it. As {{a matter of fact}} that did end it five minutes past eleven. It hadn't {{occurred}} <b>to</b> her <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>before.</b>|$|R
60|$|I say {{all this}} {{previous}} to the history, having yet, for the present, much more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> I quit my own part.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll give it honestly," [...] was all Rose {{had time}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> Charlie swept her {{away into the}} particolored cloud before them.|$|E
60|$|VOICE. What shall I say? Oh, {{tell me what}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> it's too late! They are {{all going}} away and I can't say anything.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! but, Walter,' said Florence, 'there is {{something}} that I wish <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you <b>before</b> you go away, and you must call me Florence, if you please, and not speak like a stranger.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! I have no {{objection}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it <b>before</b> Mr. de Vaux. I simply {{want to ask you}} whether you consider him a proper visitor in this house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{pressed her}} hands more tightly. [...] "I may be wronging you," [...] she answered; [...] "I should love to think so; but--you have {{something}} you want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Corp <b>before</b> I see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "you {{will make}} {{yourself}} sick eating them, I'll venture <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>before</b> {{you have been}} in Paris twenty-four hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] he cried; [...] "I have {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> {{you speak to}} me. Don't deceive yourself with vain hopes. Promise me that, before I begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> I turn you {{out on the}} prairie?" [...] asked Coombs pompously; and remembering many an old grievance I answered with cheerful readiness: ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{knows what}} I am going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> even <b>before</b> I <b>say</b> it—maybe even <b>before</b> I have thought it—and {{that is very}} rare. You are lucky if you meet someone like that once in your life. Pressburger on Powell ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been doing? I thought {{you told me that}} you had quite {{finished}} the two pictures, the day you came <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>before</b> you started for Brussels." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gather round me, boys, will yez [...] Gather round me? [...] And {{hear what}} I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] <b>Before</b> ould Salley brings me [...] My bread and jug of tay; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can {{say what}} you have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> Mr. Ennison, if at all," [...] Anna {{declared}} calmly. [...] "In any case, I decline to see you alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you please," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{wanted to}} speak to you, Capitaine Rotherby. There was {{something}} I forgot <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> I went out this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a pity that I {{should have}} been obliged to speak at all," [...] Pen answered. [...] "And I have more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>before</b> I have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huffle Scuffle! Ha, ha, ha! He {{always was}} Huffle Scuffle; a noisy, pretentious, empty-headed fellow. But I oughtn't <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so <b>before</b> you, young man. Come, we'll {{go into the}} drawing-room." ...|$|R
5000|$|I wouldn't {{have been}} able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> three words <b>before</b> making a mistake; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Mulford, do me the favour {{to step up}} here," [...] said Spike, {{leading the}} way on to the rock himself. [...] "I have a word <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you <b>before</b> we get on board the old Molly once more." ...|$|R
