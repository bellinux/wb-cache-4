50|$|Ybt {{synthesis}} occurs by a mixed nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) mechanism. Several enzymes, {{most notably}} the HMWP2-HMWP1complex, assemble salicylate, three cysteines, a malonyl linker group and three methyl groups into a four-ring structure made of salicylate, one thiazolidine, and two <b>thiazoline</b> rings with a malonyl linker between the <b>thiazoline</b> and the thiazolidine. YbtD, a phosphopantetheinyl transferase, adds phosphopantetheine tethers to the cysteine, salicylate and malonyl groups to HMWP1 and HMWP2. YbtS synthesizes salicylate from chorismate, which is then adenylated by YbtE and transferred to the HMWP2-HMWP1 assembly complex. HMWP2, which consists of two multidomain NRPS modules, accepts the activated salicylate unit through a carrier protein, then cyclizes and condenses two cysteines to form two <b>thiazoline</b> rings. A malonyl linker is added by the PKS portion of HMWP1, and YbtU reduces the second <b>thiazoline</b> ring to thiazolidine before cyclization and condensation of the final <b>thiazoline</b> ring on HMWP1’s NRPs domain. YbtT thioesterase may serve some editing function to remove abnormal molecules from the enzyme complex, and a thioesterase domain of HMWP1 releases the completed siderophore from the enzyme complex.|$|E

50|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} (SAR) of a molecule is {{the connection between}} the structural moieties within the compound, and how those specific structures directly contribute to the extent and character of the molecule’s biological activity. Kalkitoxin exhibits potent cytotoxicity which relies on the complete <b>thiazoline</b> ring for its action. Kalkitoxin analogs lacking the complete <b>thiazoline</b> ring exhibit on the order of 1000-fold decreased toxicity to solid tumor cell lines. This indicates the <b>thiazoline</b> ring structure is a crucial component of kalkitoxin's mechanism of cytotoxicity. The necessity of the stereochemistry exhibited in natural (+)-kalkitoxin decreases moving towards the chiral centers in the core of the molecule, while the more terminal chiral centers and amide methyl group are increasingly crucial for toxicity. In a study which assayed for the toxicity of kalkitoxin and various analogs against brine shrimp, the analogs which experienced the least significant loss of potency were epimers at either C8 or C10. This indicates that C8 and C10 chiralities in natural (+)-kalkitoxin are the least critical for toxic biological activity. It is apparent that C10 chirality is less critical than C8, because the epimer of (+)-kalkitoxin at C10 is more potent than the epimer at C8. Furthermore, the removal of the C10 methyl group has a smaller impact on potency than does epimerization of C7, supporting the trend of decreased SAR correlation at core chiral centers on the aliphatic chain. Epimerization at C3, the attachment point of the terminal alkene to the <b>thiazoline</b> ring, further decreases potency of kalkitoxin, in agreement with the <b>thiazoline</b> ring and overall conformation of the leftmost segment of the molecule being critical for bioactivity. Finally, replacement of the tertiary amide with a secondary amide eliminates any observable toxicity, so this structure is crucial in the mechanism of kalkitoxin toxicity.|$|E

5000|$|Kalkitoxin is a lipopeptide toxin [...] with a {{molecular}} weight of 366.604Da. Its chemical formula is C21H38N2OS.

The four methyl groups (each at a methine chiral center), the structure’s overall stereochemistry, and the N-methyl group all contribute to the toxicity of kalkitoxin.|$|E

50|$|Patellamide A {{originates}} from a ribosomal peptide, {{making it}} {{a member of the}} RiPP superfamily of natural products. This was determined after genome sequencing of P. didemi showed a lack of non ribosomal peptide synthetases. The biosynthetic gene cluster for patellamide A contains the genes patA, patB, patC, patD, patE, patF and patG. These genes, when introduced into E. coli, cause the production of patellamide A, definitively confirming their responsibility for patellamide A biosynthesis. The gene patE encodes the precursor peptide that contains the primary sequences of patellamides A and C. It has been proposed by Schmidt et al. that this prepatellamide is heterocyclized to form the oxazoline and <b>thiazoline</b> rings by PatD2. It is proposed that PatG1 is subsequently involved in oxidizing the <b>thiazoline</b> rings to the thiazole rings found in patellamide A. The peptide is then cleaved, possibly by PatA or PatG2, and cyclized, the cyclization is likely aided by adenylation by PatD1, forming the two cyclic peptides, patellamides A and C. Although all the amino acids used in the production of patellamide A are L-amino acids, some of the amino acids found in natural patellamide A are the D-epimers. It is proposed that epimerization of these amino acids occurs spontaneously. This was determined by comparison to a similar system, lissoclinamide 7.|$|E

50|$|OGA catalyzes O-GlcNAc {{hydrolysis}} via an oxazoline reaction intermediate.

The GlcNAcstatin family of inhibitors exploit this mechanism in order to inhibit OGA activity. For both types of inhibitors, OGA can be selected apart from the generic lysosomal hexosaminidases by elongating the C2 substituent in their chemical structure. This takes advantage of a deep pocket in OGA's active site that allow it to bind analogs of GlcNAc.|$|E

50|$|Another {{point of}} {{diversion}} {{between these two}} syntheses {{is the number of}} carbons separating the keto-auxiliary group from the chiral center at C7. This group was separated by one carbon from C7 in the first total synthesis, so the keto-auxiliary moiety could be converted to a carboxylic acid, in anticipation of addition of the amino alcohol immediately thereafter. In this synthesis, this keto-auxiliary group is directly adjacent to C7, necessitating a one carbon homologation, before construction of the <b>thiazoline</b> ring. This was achieved through reductive bond cleavage of the auxiliary group to a primary alcohol and oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde, Wittig reaction using an ylide carrying a methoxy group to produce an enol ether, hydrolysis to the aldehyde and finally oxidation to produce the carboxylic acid.|$|E
50|$|Epothilone B {{starts with}} a 2-methyl-4-carboxythiazole starter unit, which was formed through the {{translational}} coupling between PKS, EPOS A (epoA) module, and NRPS, EPOS P(epoP) module. The EPOS A contains a modified β-ketoacyl-synthase (malonyl-ACP decarboxylase, KSQ), an acyltransferase (AT), an enoyl reductase (ER), and an acyl carrier protein domain (ACP). The EPOS P however, contains a heterocylization, an adenylation, an oxidase, and a thiolation domain. These domains are important because {{they are involved in}} the formation of the five-membered heterocyclic ring of the thiazole. As seen in Figure 4, the EPOS P activates the cysteine and binds the activated cysteine as an aminoacyl-S-PCP. Once the cysteine has been bound, EPOS A loads an acetate unit onto the EPOS P complex, thus initiating the formation of the <b>thiazoline</b> ring by intramolecular cyclodehydration.|$|E
50|$|This {{effort was}} the first total {{synthesis}} of (+)-kalkitoxin, and served the purpose of deducing the specific stereochemistry of natural kalkitoxin. This synthesis began from an alcohol bearing the proper chirality at C8 and C10 found in (+)-kalkitoxin, and carried a dimethylphenylsiloxy (DPSO) group positioned beta to C8, and a terminal alkene positioned alpha to C10. Hydroboration of this alkene gives the resulting alcohol, which is converted to an azide, which is the position at which (R)-2-methylbutyric acid is coupled to produce the sec-butyl group and amide group. The amide is subsequently methylated, finalizing the tertiary amide which {{has been shown to}} be so crucial for kalkitoxin toxicity. O-Desilylation and oxidation of the resulting alcohol produce an acceptor for a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, wherein a carbonyl and an alpha-methylated phosphonate react to produce an alkene. In this case, a beta-keto phosphonate bearing an (R)-phenylglycine-derived auxiliary group was ligated to the molecule. This group is lost in asymmetric conjugate addition of an (R)-amino alcohol, which, through two cyclodehydration steps using Wipf’s oxazoline-thiazoline interconversion protocol, produces the <b>thiazoline</b> ring.|$|E

The cltN gene is believed to encode an enzyme that is involved in the formation of the tertiary thioether, however this has not been proven and cltN is not regulated by ctmH.CtmA,ctmD ,ctmF, and ctmG deletion leads to the disappearance of cyclothiazomycin A.|$|R
