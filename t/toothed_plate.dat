Lifting {{a section of the}} cockpit flooring, French Pete brought out two triangular frames of steel. At the apex of one of these triangles; in a ring for the purpose, he made fast a piece of stout rope. From this the sides (inch rods) diverged at almost right angles, and extended down for a distance of four feet or more, where they were connected by the third side of the triangle, which was the bottom of the dredge. This was a flat plate of steel over a yard in length, to which was bolted a row of long, sharp teeth, likewise of steel. Attached to the <b>toothed</b> <b>plate,</b> and to the sides of the frame was a net of very coarse fishing-twine, which Joe correctly surmised was there to catch the oysters raked loose by the teeth {{from the bottom of the}} bay.|$|E

40|$|The fire {{performance}} of heavy timber frame structures is often {{limited by the}} poor {{fire performance}} of its connections. Conventional timber connections, dowelled or <b>toothed</b> <b>plate</b> connections typically use steel as a connector material. In a fire, the steel parts rapidly conduct heat into the timber, leading to reduced fire performance. Replacing metallic connectors with alternative non-metallic, low thermal conductivity connector materials can, therefore, lead to improved connection performance in fire. This paper presents an experimental study into the fire performance of metal-free timber connections comprising a hot-pressed plywood flitch plate and glassfibre- reinforced polymer dowels. The thermal behaviour of the connections at elevated temperatures is studied using a standard cone calorimeter apparatus and a novel heat transfer rate inducing system. The latter is a fire testing system developed at the University of Edinburgh. The mechanical behaviour of the connection during severe heating was also studied using an environmental chamber at temperatures up to 610 °C. The results demonstrate that heat transfer in the non-metallic connections is governed by the thermal properties of the timber, resulting in significant enhancements in connection fire performance...|$|E
40|$|The genus Martinichthys {{belongs to}} the order Tselfatiiformes and {{contains}} two valid species, M. brevis with a short rostrum and M. ziphioides with a long rostrum. The species M. acutus, M. alternatus, M. gracilis, M. intermedius and M. latus are junior synonyms of M. ziphioides. The genus is characterized by five autapomorphies: a snout lengthened in a rostrum, a narrow cranial roof, the premaxillae forming a secondary palate and hiding the vomer, {{the lack of an}} anterior process on the maxilla, and the supraoccipital without a median crest. Despite its specialized characters, Martinichthys also keeps some primitive features for the order, such as the presence of an autogenous basisphenoid and of three lingual <b>toothed</b> <b>plates.</b> Within the Tselfatiiformes, Martinichthys appears especially close to the genera Plethodus and Thryptodus.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} results of symmetrical push-out tests performed on notched and <b>toothed</b> metal <b>plate</b> connectors for {{laminated veneer lumber}} �LVL�-concrete composite floor systems. The characteristic shear strength and slip moduli were evaluated for three types of connectors: � 1 � a 300 -mm-long rectangular notch cut in the LVL joist and reinforced with a 16 -mm-diameter lag screw; � 2 � a triangular notch reinforced with the same lag screw; and � 3 � two 333 -mm-long <b>toothed</b> metal <b>plates</b> pressed in the lateral surface of two adjacent LVL joists. The shear force versus relative slip relationships are presented together with analytical prepeak and postpeak approximations {{which can be used}} to carry out nonlinear finite-element analyses of LVL-concrete composite beams. The failure mechanisms of the notched connections are also discussed. Analytical design formulas for shear-strength evaluation of notched connections derived in accordance with New Zealand Standards and Eurocodes are proposed based on four possible failure mechanisms.

40|$|The {{current market}} for rope capture devices shows a trend of using toothed devices as {{the method of}} {{creating}} a rope capture system. These systems are effective {{for a variety of}} applications but in any scenario in which a high load is encountered there is a large amount of damage done by the teeth to the rope. The objective of this project was to create a rope capture device that did not utilize teeth {{in order to create a}} safer loading condition on the rope. The method used for this project was application of equiangular spirals, this is the same method used for climbing cams. A profile was built using a section of a mathematical curve and was imported into a CAD/CAM program in order to be manufactured. Initial calculations showed that a small cam could replace the <b>toothed</b> <b>plates</b> used in commercial devices in order to remove the elements which could damage the sheath of the rope. The results of the project showed a successful application of the mathematical principles in creating a device that would slide up the rope cleanly in one direction but immediately catch in the opposite direction.

40|$|Significant {{evidence}} {{based on}} experimental research exists to give designers {{confidence in the}} use of theoretical equations to evaluate the pull-out strength of threaded steel rods glued into timber. However the mechanism of load transfer through a timber frame moment joint utilizing glued-in steel rods requires more than understanding simply the tension performance of a glued-in rod. This paper presents a method of evaluating joint strength for moment and axial forces based on traditional mechanics theory adapted for use with timber. It takes into consideration the effects of time dependant deformation in timber at bearing interfaces and considers also the effects of stress concentrations imposed by the steel rods on the timber. The approach provides a methodology for joint design that has been successfully used in many projects. Structural joint design in its simplest form involves unidirectional force transfers. A variety of traditional fastening methods employing dowel type, <b>toothed</b> <b>plate</b> or glued connections are appropriate.

40|$|At joining of {{clothing}} details different defects may be observed. One {{of the most}} obvious defects is stitch length unevenness along the seam. The maximum stitch length unevenness along the seam {{is known to be}} obtained by sewing at different speed. This paper concerns with the theoretical research of fabric load and external friction forces that have influence on change in stitch length along the seam. It was demonstrated that the inertial motion path, after its detachment from the <b>toothed</b> <b>plate,</b> of the fabric is determined by sewing speed, mass of the fabric and load, and friction conditions. The carried out calculations illustrate that at a low ratio between the fabric mass and load mass, influence of the ratio between the friction coefficients of the sewing garment and load on change in length is different: when the ratio between friction coefficients is below 1, increase of the mass ratio leads to higher change in stitch length; when the ratio of friction coefficients is above 1, increase of the mass ratio leads to lower change in stitch length; when the mass ratio fluctuates within greater limits, a tendency of stitch length change variation is not subject to the friction ratio, and change increases in all cases. It was established that greater influence on stitch length change in made by friction conditions. With the increasing ratio of the aforementioned friction coefficients, the stitch length may decrease down b...|$|E

50|$|The {{first true}} {{circular}} dividing engine was probably constructed by Henry Hindley, a clockmaker, around 1739. This {{was reported to}} the Royal Society by John Smeaton in 1785. It was based directly on a gear cutting machine for clockworks. It used a <b>toothed</b> index <b>plate</b> and a worm gear to advance the mechanism. Duc de Chaulnes created two dividing engines between 1765 and 1768 for dividing circular arcs and linear scales. He desired to improve on the graduation of instruments by removing the skill of the maker from the technique where possible. While beam compass use was critically dependent on the skill of the user, his machine produced more regular divisions {{by virtue of its}} design. His machines were also inspired by the prior work of the clockmakers.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} {{the need for}} timber {{connections}} with high fire performance. Connections of members in timber structures commonly comprise steel connectors, such as dowels, screws, nails and <b>toothed</b> <b>plates.</b> However, multiple {{studies have shown that}} the presence of exposed metal in timber connections leads to a poor performance under fire conditions. Replacing metallic fasteners with non-metallic fasteners potentially enhances the fire performance of timber connections. Previous studies showed that Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) dowels can be a viable replacement for steel dowels and that Densified Veneer Wood functions well as a flitch plate material. However, as the resin matrix of GFRP dowels is viscoelastic, connection creep, which is not studied before, can be of concern. Also no research has been carried out on the fire performance of these connections. Therefore, a study of the creep behaviour and the fire performance of non-metallic timber connections comprising GFRP dowels and a Densified Veneer Wood flitch plate was performed, as is discussed in this thesis. Predictive models were proposed to determine the connection slip and load bearing capacity at ambient and elevated temperatures and in a fire. The material properties and heat transfer properties required for these models were determined experimentally and predictions of these models were experimentally validated. Furthermore, an adjustment of the predictive model of connection slip at ambient temperature allowed approximating the creep of the connection. The material properties, required for the creep model, were determined experimentally and predictions of the model were compared to results of longterm connection tests. The study confirmed that timber members jointed with non-metallic connectors have a significantly improved fire performance to timber joints using metallic connections. Models developed and proposed to predict fire performance gave accurate predictions of time to failure. It was concluded that non-metallic connections showed more creep per load per connector, than metallic connections. However, the ratio between initial deflection and creep (relative creep) and the ratio between load level and creep were shown to be similar for metallic and non-metallic connections...|$|R

40|$|Timber-concrete {{composite}} {{floors are}} {{a combination of}} timber joists and concrete topping, creating a flooring system to best utilise the advantages each material has to offer. Timber is used as the main tensile load bearing material due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, while concrete is used in floor slabs for its advantages in stiffness and acoustic separation. The strength {{of the system is}} dependent on the connection between timber and concrete, thus the connection must be strong, stiff, and economical to manufacture, to ensure that the flooring system is economically viable. This research investigated the fire performance and failure behaviour of timber-concrete composite floor systems currently under development in New Zealand, resulting in a calculation method for evaluating the fire resistance of these floors. Furnace tests were performed on two full-size floor specimens at the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ). Both floor specimens were 4 m long and 3 m wide, consisting of 65 mm concrete topping on plywood formwork, connected to double LVL floor joists. They were tested over a 4 m span, subjected to a nominal design live load of 2. 5 kPa. Both floors were subjected to the ISO 834 test fire for over 60 minutes. Two separate connection types were tested; concrete notches cut into the timber beams with an incorporated shear key, and metal <b>toothed</b> <b>plates</b> pressed between the double beams. It was found that the reduction in section size of the timber beams due to the fire governed the failure mode of the floors. Due to the composite action achieved by the connections, the floor units were able to withstand prolonged exposure to the test fire, well exceeding one hour. The test data and visual observations aided {{in the development of a}} numerical model for evaluating the fire resistance of the floors. This was developed in a spreadsheet that is able to predict the expected fire resistance of these floors, taking into account some major time dependent variable properties that can have an effect on the overall performance. Load-span tables have been produced to give the estimated fire resistance of floors with differing floor dimensions, span lengths and applied loads...|$|R
40|$|Timber-concrete {{composite}} (TCC) floor systems utilize {{composite action}} between a timber joist and a concrete topping {{to increase their}} span. Their overall structural performance is significantly influenced by the load-slip relationship, strength, stiffness and positions of the connectors providing the composite action. The relatively low elastic modulus of timber, however, may affect the dynamic (vibration) performance of medium to long-span TCC floors. Three broad areas are currently under investigation at the University of Canterbury: (1) {{the choice of the}} best type of connection: (2) the collapse behaviour under static (gravity) loads; and (3) the vibration susceptibility. This paper presents preliminary results of experimental tests used to characterise the connection systems as they are tested to failure under monotonic loads. Based on those outcomes, a semi-prefabricated composite floor system is proposed. The system is constructed from prefabricated panels made from timber joists and plywood sheets, and by a concrete slab cast-in-situ on top of the panels.

All well-designed beams provided more than 95 % composite action even though there were relatively few connectors (e. g. six 300 mm long notches on the 8 m span beam). The ULS and SLS live load capacity of the beams was found to be approximately 90 % of that of a fully composite beam. Correction factors providing a 15 % increase for deflection and a 13 % reduction of the effective bending stiffness are proposed for calculations using the transformed section method for all well-designed beams, i. e. beams designed using the gamma -method according to Annex B of Eurocode 5. Although the gamma -method was found to be significantly underestimate the ULS strength, it provided an accurate prediction of the short-term deflection. In terms of the connection type, the 300 mm rectangular notches provided the best performance, with high stiffness and strength beyond the ULS load level, and requiring fewer connectors along the beam. The triangular notch was found to be a viable alternative, with more connectors but was easier and faster to cut than a rectangular notch.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the best floor {{solution}} {{has always been a}} key issue in the design and construction of multi-storey timber buildings. Strict performance requirements such as effective acoustic separation of inter-tenancy floors, thermal mass, fire resistance, limitation of deflection, resistance to vibrations and effective diaphragm action are very hard to comply with if only timber is used. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the preliminary and some ongoing research in the short- and long-term carried out mainly at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, for the realisation of a semi-prefabricated laminated veneer lumber (LVL) -concrete composite floor system in both the local and Australasian market. The paper discusses a novel semi-prefabricated LVLconcrete composite system where panels made from LVL joists and plywood flooring are prefabricated off-site. Once the panels are lifted onto the supports and connected side-by-side, a concrete topping is cast-in-situ so as to form a continuous slab connecting all the panels. Composite action between the concrete topping and the panels is achieved using different types of connectors, such as various forms of notches cut from the LVL joists and reinforced with coach screws or <b>toothed</b> metal <b>plates</b> pressed in the LVL joists. After pointing out the advantages of the proposed system over traditional only-timber and only-concrete floor solutions, the paper describes push-out tests in the short-term on connections used in the LVL-concrete composite. Tests to failure of small LVL-concrete composite blocks (push-out tests) with different types and shapes of connection systems were performed at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. The results are parametrically evaluated and discussed in detail. The failure mechanism of the notched connection is highlighted together with the strength and stiffness values for each tested connection system. Subsequently, the four best connection systems were identified and used in beam specimens of 8 - 10 m in span.

40|$|In recent years, timber–concrete {{composite}} {{systems have}} become more widely used as a new construction technique for buildings and bridges. The main advantage is that the compressive strength of concrete is exploited {{through the use of}} composite action while timber beams are able to resist the tensile stresses. The level of composite action, which can be achieved by the system, is dependent on the type of shear connector used. There is a lack of knowledge, however, on the performance of these types of connections when subjected to cyclic loading, which is typical for bridges. Testing was performed in the Structures Laboratory of the University of Canterbury to analyse the fatigue behaviour of two types of timber–concrete connections via push-out specimens, and two beam specimens representing strips of composite floor with the same connection types. The two types of connection investigated were: (i) a rectangular notch connection reinforced with a coach screw (also known as lag screw); and (ii) a connection with <b>toothed</b> metal <b>plates</b> punched into laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The stiffness of the connection was monitored throughout the cyclic loading along with the total amount of slip occurring between the concrete and timber. After the application of 2 million cycles, the push-out and beam specimens were loaded to failure in order to quantify their maximum strength. The strength of the rectangular notched connection after cyclic loading was 0. 95 times of the one without cyclic loading, while for the metal plate connection was 0. 60 times. For the metal plate connection, a continuous increase in slip was observed with increased cycles possibly due to accumulated damage from repeated loading. The rectangular notch connection displayed more resistance to changes in slip, strength and stiffness than the metal plate connection. No obvious loss of stiffness was observed in the rectangular notch connected floor beams after 2 million cycles, and when tested to failure the stiffness was very similar to the same floor beam that had not been cyclically loaded. The floor beam with metal plate connections did not perform well and failed after 350, 000 cycles. The loss of strength, stiffness and composite action in this floor beam compared to the one without cyclic loading was significant. In this respect, the rectangular notch connection system is recommended for use in bridge design as opposed to metal plate connections...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} develop and assess biomechanical methods {{to assist in the}} {{evaluation}} of medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). Five studies using diverse methods were performed, including three-dimensional (3 D) gait analysis, materials testing of HTO fixation plates, and dynamic radiography in patients after surgery. Study 1 compared external knee joint moments during walking before and after varus or valgus producing osteotomy in patients with lateral or medial compartment osteoarthritis, and in healthy participants. The results highlighted the importance of alignment on gait biomechanics with changes in frontal plane angular impulse highly correlated to changes in mechanical axis. Study 2 compared the 3 D external knee moments before and after medial opening wedge HTO during level walking and during stair ascent. Long-term changes in knee moments after HTO were observed during both activities, with decreases in the peak knee adduction and internal rotation moments. Study 3 developed and tested a multi-axis fixation jig placed within a materials testing machine for assessing HTO fixation plates in a manner more representative of walking. The need to incorporate gait data into materials testing studies was highlighted, showing the importance of including a frontal plane moment during testing. Study 4 used this multi-axis fixation jig to compare flat to <b>toothed</b> HTO fixation <b>plates</b> under cyclic loading conditions. Preliminary results suggested little difference in the load at failure between the plates; however, the potential for the tooth to increase micro-motion across the osteotomy site and strain on the lateral cortical hinge should be a focus of future testing. Study 5 was a proof-of-concept study to test dynamic single-plane flat-panel (FP) radiography for use in detecting in-vivo micro-motion after medial opening wedge HTO. Preliminary results suggested dynamic FP radiography has the potential to assess fixation stability; however, results also suggested modifications in the registration algorithms may be required to increase confidence in distinguishing true motion from registration error. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that a mix of biomechanical methods can be used to advance medial opening wedge HTO, with particular focus on informing future methods of investigation to improve HTO fixation designs...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) {{deemed to}} satisfy {{solution}} for houses and small multi-unit dwellings requires external walls within 1 m of and at angles less than 90 ° to a property boundary to be fire-rated {{to a minimum}} 30 -min fire resistance rating (FRR). The NZBC also requires structural building systems to remain stable during and after fire when subjected to a uniformly distributed horizontal face load of 0. 5 kPa ‘in any direction’. This research investigated the fire performance of laterally loaded light timber-framed compartments, to assess their suitability under the NZBC requirements for residential buildings. The research involved a full-scale standard furnace experiment and a full-scale compartment fire experiment. The building design was based on common New Zealand residential building construction for a light timber-frame building with compartment dimensions of 4. 33 m × 3. 35 m and stud height of 2. 4 m. One of the 4. 33 m walls was 30 -min fire-rated and the other building elements were of typical non-fire-rated construction. Internal wall and ceiling linings were 10 mm thick standard grade plasterboard, except for the fire-rated wall which had 10 mm fibre-reinforced plasterboard {{on both sides of}} the timber framing. The external cladding and roof consisted of light-weight sheet materials except for the fire-rated wall which had no additional covering. The fire-rated wall was subjected to a lateral load applied at the top plate equivalent to a 0. 5 kPa face load. The roof truss system was an integral component in providing lateral support to the fire-rated wall and each roof truss spanned between the fire-rated wall and the parallel 4. 33 m wall. Each roof truss was designed with a splice in the centre of the bottom chord, connected by <b>toothed</b> metal connector <b>plates.</b> In the furnace experiment the compartment was heated to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve, failure of the roof truss system at the truss connector plate was observed after 30. 5 min, causing failure of the roof resulting in lateral deflection of the loaded fire-rated wall. It was found there was non-uniform temperature distribution in the compartment. An analysis of the failure taking into consideration temperature distribution in the compartment suggests that the roof truss system with splice supporting the fire-rated wall would fail in lateral stability after 26 min if the furnace had been driven to achieve the ISO 834 time-temperature relationship at ceiling level. An analysis of expected performance of an unlined compartment predicts a lateral stability failure time of 19. 5 min if exposed to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve. The compartment experiment was a natural fire with a fixed initial ventilation and fuel load consisting of wood cribs. The roof truss design incorporated specific protection of the splice using blocks of timber. The wall system failed in lateral stability after 28 min and before all the fuel in the compartment was consumed. Applying a time equivalence method suggests that the fire-rated wall restraint system performance would be the equivalent of 33. 5 min in a standard fire resistance test for the compartment. Comparing the results for Experiments # 1 and # 2, the protection added to the splice improved the performance of the lateral load restraint system from 26 min to 33. 5 min. An analysis of expected performance of an unlined compartment predicts a lateral stability failure time of 26 min if exposed to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve...|$|R
