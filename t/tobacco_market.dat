25|$|Although tea {{had been}} {{exported}} since 1904, the real {{growth of the}} tea industry in Cholo and Mlanje districts occurred after 1922 and was promoted by the collapse the Flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> <b>market.</b> The estate companies including Blantyre and East Africa Ltd owned land {{that they needed to}} put into productive use, and chose tea planting. Even by the very poor standards of southern Africa, Nyasaland's tea wages in the 1920s and 1930s were low. The tea growers argued that the quality of the tea produced and the productivity of the workers were both also low. On the three Blantyre and East Africa estates in Mlanje (Lauderdale, Glenorchy and Limbuli), workers were paid a basic wage of 6 shillings, or 30 pence in 1941 and a bonus for large amounts picked. These very low wages caused incidents on the Limbuli Estate in 1942, where the manager was censured for his behaviour towards tenants. Very few women worked at picking tea until the early 1970s but in 1973 at Glenorchy women picked approximately 2/5 of the crop. There were major slumps the world tea industry in 1919-20 and 1928-32 as more efficient planting and expansion in the areas planted created a “tea mountain”. In 1933 an International Tea Agreement scheme introduced export quotas and virtually prohibited new areas of tea planting and the selling or leasing of further land for tea growing. The Blantyre and East Africa estates were allowed to grow 2,964 acres of tea in 1939 and 3,810 acres in 1945, about 17% of total area if tea planted in Cholo and Mlanje districts in 1935, reducing to 13% in 1945.

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control requires Parties to implement a “comprehensive ban” on <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing.</b> This paper examines <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> in 16 high, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low income countries (HIC, UMIC, LMIC, LIC). Methods: The Environmental Profile of a Community’s Health study provided cross-sectional data on <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> collected between 2009 - 2012. This included direct observations during a 1 km walk in 462 communities across 16 countries, and self-reported exposure to 11 forms of marketing among almost 12, 000 individuals. Multilevel regression models were used to examine differences in marketing between urban/rural communities and country income groups, controlling for potential confounders. Findings: 10 % of individuals reported seeing five or more types of <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> in the last six months. Multilevel regression analysis showed that compared with HICs the observed number of advertisements per community was 81 times higher in LICs (p= 0. 004), the number of tobacco outlets 2. 5 times higher in both LICs (p= 0. 019) and LMICs (p= 0. 012), while the odds of self-reported exposure to at least one form of traditional marketing (television, radio, posters, signage, print, cinema) were almost 10 times higher in LICs (p= 0. 030). For 13 of 15 measures, marketing exposure was significantly lower in rural than urban communities.

Exposure to POS <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> was measured by asking respondents three questions about noticing pack displays, advertisements, and promotions in their respective neighborhoods stores. These three variables were combined into a scale of exposure to POS <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing.</b> About 68 % of the respondents participated in a six-month follow-up phone interview and provided data on quit attempts and smoking cessation. At the six-month follow-up, 39. 9 % of respondents reported to have made a quit attempt, and 21. 8 % of those who made a quit attempt succeeded in quitting. Exposure to POS marketing at baseline was not associated with the probability of having made a quit attempt as reported at the six-month follow-up (p = 0. 129). However, higher exposure to POS marketing was associated with a lower probability of quit success among smokers who reported to have attempted to quit smoking at six-month follow-up (p = 0. 006).

40|$|Tobacco {{and alcohol}} are {{responsible}} for an estimated 12. 5 % of global deaths, a percentage which is set to rise. Evidence shows that tobacco and alcohol industry marketing influences smoking and drinking initiation and prevalence, and although <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> is increasingly regulated (including through the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a legally binding global treaty) controls on alcohol marketing remain more limited. There are three novel strands to this thesis. First, systematic reviews examining how the tobacco and alcohol industries have attempted to influence marketing regulations, {{and the development of}} two new taxonomies for tactic and argument categorisation. Second, a statistical analysis of the <b>tobacco</b> and alcohol <b>marketing</b> environments across a diverse range of countries, including the extent of any geographic or urban/rural differences. And third, an assessment of tobacco and alcohol industry compliance with national marketing regulations. Substantial commonalities between tobacco and alcohol industry activity were identified, suggesting that alcohol policy may benefit from reproducing efforts in tobacco control aimed at excluding industry from policy discussions. Additionally, data analysis showed that there were high levels of <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> despite FCTC ratification, and that exposure to alcohol marketing was even higher. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> was greatest whereas alcohol marketing was lowest in lower income countries, and both were significantly more common in urban communities. All FCTC-ratified countries had some <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> bans in place, whereas few countries had any comprehensive bans on alcohol marketing.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} effect of the <b>tobacco</b> industry's <b>marketing</b> {{practices}} on adolescents by examining the relationship between their receptivity to these practices and their susceptibility to start smoking.  DESIGN—Paper-and-pencil surveys measuring association with other smokers, exposure to <b>tobacco</b> industry <b>marketing</b> strategies, experience with smoking, and resolve not to smoke in the future.  SETTING— 25 randomly selected classrooms in five middle schools in San Jose, California.  SUBJECTS— 571 seventh graders with an average age of 13  years and 8  months; 57 % were female. Forty-five per cent of the students were Asian, 38 % were Hispanic, 12 % were white, and 5 % were black.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Exposure to social influences, receptivity to marketing strategies, susceptibility to start smoking.  RESULTS—About 70 % of the participants indicated at least moderate receptivity to <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> materials. Children who are more receptive are also more susceptible to start smoking. In addition to demographics and social influences, receptivity to <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> materials was found to be strongly associated with susceptibility.  CONCLUSIONS—Tobacco companies conduct marketing campaigns that effectively capture teenage attention and stimulate desire for their promotional items.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{recent trends}} in smoking {{initiation}} by adolescents with trends in inflation-adjusted cigarette pricing and <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> expenditures. DESIGN: We examined smoking initiation trends in demographic subgroups of adolescents aged 14 - 17 years {{during the decade}} 1979 - 1989. Data on cigarette pricing and <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> expenditures were adjusted for inflation and plotted over this same period. SETTING: Large population surveys, United States. SUBJECTS: 140, 975 ever-smokers aged 17 - 38 when surveyed in 1992 or 1993, who reported on age of smoking initiation during the decade 1979 - 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Initiation rate was calculated as the number in an age group who reported starting to smoke regularly in a year, divided {{by the number of}} never-smokers {{at the start of the}} year. Trends were evaluated by linear and quadratic models. RESULTS: From 1979 to 1984, adolescent initiation rates decreased, but increased thereafter, particularly among males, whites, and those who, as adults, reported never having graduated from high school. Cigarette price increased throughout the decade as did <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> expenditures, especially for coupons, value-added items, and promotional allowances. CONCLUSION: Availability of cheaper cigarettes is not likely to be a cause of increased smoking initiation by adolescents. Although other influences cannot be ruled out, we suspect that the expanded <b>tobacco</b> <b>marketing</b> budget, with its increased emphasis on tactics that may be particularly pertinent to young people, affected adolescent initiation rates. ...|$|R
