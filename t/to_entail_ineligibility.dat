50|$|La Ecoaldea (the Ecovillage) is {{a housing}} project born in 1996 {{as a result of}} the {{concerns}} of a group of people to minimize the negative impact that human constructions have on the environment.

40|$|A {{different}} perspective on the long-standing problem of amorphous solidification is offered, based on an alternative definition of a solid as a porous medium.

Nonlinear screening, {{in addition to}} generating effective many-body interactions, is shown <b>to</b> <b>entail</b> essential corrections <b>to</b> the pair potential and one-body volume energy.
