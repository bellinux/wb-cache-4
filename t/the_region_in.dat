40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the energy efficiency of China's 30 administrative <b>regions</b> during <b>the</b> period from 1997 to 2010. Most existing studies ignored the variation of production technologies among <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> China. Taking this factor into account, we introduce a parametric metafrontier approach {{based on the}} Shephard energy distance function. For further analysis, <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> China are divided into three groups using cluster analysis. We find that <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> group 1 (mainly <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east area of China) not only have the highest energy efficiency score, but also {{take the lead in}} terms of technology gap ratio. Meanwhile, due to their backward technology levels, the average energy efficiency score of <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> group 3 (mainly <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west area of China) is particularly low. Moreover, the pooled estimation, which ignores the technology gap among the groups, tends to underestimate the energy efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Nigerian English, or pidgin (a mix of English and indigenous words) is often used because of ethnic diversity and sometimes because of the diversity of dialects in the Igbo language.
