5|$|Peterborough {{sent two}} members to {{parliament}} {{for the first}} time in 1547. Before the civil war, many were relatives of the clergy; then for two hundred years after the restoration <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> Fitzwilliam, or a Fitzwilliam nominee, sitting as member for Peterborough, making it a Whig stronghold. Representation was reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> piano in the house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought him a new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

The duchess of Orléans died, and he apparently had to give up his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sablière, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have had no trouble whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to that of theatrical composition.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{continued}} as a centre of clergy training until 1978, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> proportion {{of students who}} did not intend to be ordained. The 1896 charter specifically stated that the college could accept anyone, regardless of whether they intended to take Holy Orders and, since 1925, it had been possible to study for a BA at the college without studying any theology at all. Throughout the college's history, non-ordinands had been in a minority. In the 1950s however, the number of ordinands declined sharply and the College faced possible closure unless it could secure government funding. Principal J.R. Lloyd Thomas did not spare himself in the fight for survival and, in 1960, after much negotiation, University College, Cardiff, agreed to sponsor Saint David's. Thus the government finally began to assist SDC financially.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1966 Syrian coup d'état, which overthrew the Aflaqite faction led by Michel Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, Munif al-Razzaz and others, the {{original}} Ba'ath Party split into Iraqi-dominated and a Syrian-dominated ba'ath movements. The two movements established separate National Commands; the National Command was in theory the highest party body in both movements, and controlled their respective ba'athist movements. However, {{in both countries}} the National Command was {{under the control of}} its respective Regional Command. In the Iraqi-dominated Ba'ath movement, all National Command members came from their regional branch; for instance, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> member representing the Ba'ath Party branch in Jordan. In theory the National Command was the highest party organ between national congresses, with the power to control the affairs of Regional Commands in other regions (countries).|$|E

Butterfield produced 12 major theater productions over the years including the full-length shows of Peter Pan, Oliver!, The Wizard of Oz and Annie, Jr., as well as Willy Wonka, Jr. which was produced in the spring 2009. Honk, Jr. was Butterfield's final performance in June, 2010. Butterfield's theatre productions were produced by Barbara Egbert and/or Kim Rosales and have been directed by Ilene Moore. Students from across the district's boundaries, as well as those from neighboring school districts, attended Butterfield to participate in the magnet program.

500|$|Gates {{was born}} in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He {{is the son of}} William H. Gates Sr. (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry {{includes}} English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served {{on the board of directors}} for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates's maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or [...] "Trey" [...] because his father had the [...] "II" [...] suffix. [...] Early on in his life, Gates's parents had a law career in mind for him. [...] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that [...] "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> reward for winning and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> penalty for losing".|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} {{of so many}} businesses led to the flight of residents towards the suburbs and the economic decline of the neighborhood through the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. As the area became known for its drug addicts, Ben's Chili Bowl reduced its staff to one employee. Ben and Virginia's son Kamal recalled, [...] "We stayed and had a following, because the Chili Bowl was like the neighborhood barbershop. People would sit here and chat. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> family presence and the locals protected us." [...] The restaurant stopped serving pies and cakes, which attracted addicts, while police conducted surveillance on drug dealers from an upstairs window of the building.|$|E

Childs joined the recalled Gatting and DeFreitas, and newcomer David Capel. Small and Paul Jarvis were both left out due to injury, and Derek Pringle was dropped, but the most media attention focused on Chris Broad, who was also dropped, [...] "ostensibly for his consistent failure to make runs in home Tests, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> suspicion {{that he was being}} disciplined for the incident at Lord's when he was spotted by a television camera mouthing his disappointment at an lbw decision".|$|E

The album is Paul's attempt to teach children about some of America's most famous heroes. [...] "I was {{a big fan of}} Schoolhouse Rock in the 70s.

[...] Oasis's official photographer Jill Furmanovsky felt the media's focus, and was preyed upon by tabloid journalists living in the flat upstairs from her: [...] "They thought I had the band hiding in my flat." [...] In paranoia, Oasis cut themselves off from their wider circle. According to Johnny Hopkins, the publicist of Oasis's label Creation Records, [...] "People were being edged out of the circle around Oasis. People who knew them before they were famous rather than because they were famous." [...] Hopkins likened the situation to a medieval court, complete with kings, courtiers and jesters.

500|$|Although the {{importance}} of regionalism declined, it still arose from time to time. For example, in appointing Benjamin Cardozo in 1929, President Hoover was as concerned about the controversy over having three New York justices on the Court {{as he was about}} having two Jewish justices. David M. O'Brien notes that [...] "rom the appointment of John Rutledge from South Carolina in 1789 until the retirement of Hugo Black [...] in 1971, {{with the exception of the}} Reconstruction decade of 1866–1876, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> southerner on the bench. Until 1867, the sixth seat was reserved as the 'southern seat'. Until Cardozo's appointment in 1932, the third seat was reserved for New Englanders." [...] The westward expansion of the U.S. led to concerns that the western states should be represented on the Court as well, which purportedly prompted William Howard Taft to make his 1910 appointment of Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming.|$|E
500|$|The first {{building}} constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the guardhouse (Bldg 9) at {{the southwest}} corner of the fort. [...] In 1891, visitors traveled the lower Mammoth road through what is now the main residential area for park personnel. The guardhouse was the first building they encountered in the Mammoth area and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> sentry on duty to check visitors entering the park. [...] The building is now a private residence. The original fort administration building (Bldg 8) was located immediately next to the guardhouse and is now also a private residence. Of the twelve buildings constructed in 1891, the most prominent are two of the four double officers' quarters (Bldgs 6 and 7) which front the old parade ground. [...] Other buildings constructed in 1891 included a 60-man barracks, a commissary storehouse (Bldg 10), a quartermaster storehouse (Bldg 11), a granary (Bldg 12), a bakery (Bldg 24), a stable (Bldg 25) and the first two of four non-commissioned officers' (NCO) quarters (Bldgs 30 and 33).
