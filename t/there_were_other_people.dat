25|$|The {{bystander}} {{effect was}} first {{demonstrated in the}} laboratory by John M. Darley and Bibb Latané in 1968 after they {{became interested in the}} topic following the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most replicable effects in social psychology. In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is staged and researchers measure how long it takes the participants to intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin. For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress. 70 percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the room only 40 percent offered help.|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs on}} Diorama were {{inspired}} by Johns' then-girlfriend Natalie Imbruglia, but he cautioned against possible misinterpretations of the songs, stating [...] "Everyone will think that any lyric that's about someone {{in a positive light}} will be about her" [...] and noting that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> he cared for about whom he wrote the songs. Johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending Imbruglia to sing them.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1979 The Go-Betweens {{relocated}} to London, they re-released their early material and followed with another single, [...] "I Need Two Heads", also written by Forster. It peaked at No.6 on the United Kingdom Independent Charts. The group remained in UK {{for almost a}} year but ran out of money and needed a drummer, so they returned to Brisbane. By November 1980 Lindy Morrison (ex-Xero) had joined the group on drums and backing vocals. By 1981 Forster and Morrison were also lovers, she later remembered [...] "Robert never took part in any group discussions ... He would not stay in the house if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> present ... he and I would have cups of tea on the verandah and debate the place of politics in art".|$|E

2500|$|Gerbic's {{interest}} in paranormal and fringe topics began during childhood, {{when she was}} most frightened by spontaneous human combustion, [...] "the idea {{that you could be}} walking down the street and suddenly, BOOM!" [...] She grew up in Salinas as a Southern Baptist who became interested in skepticism in the 1990s. [...] "I had never heard the word atheist until I was in my late teens," [...] Gerbic told Skeptical Inquirer editor Benjamin Radford. [...] "Once I found out <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who felt the way I did, I read everything I could on the subject". In 2000, Gerbic discovered that there was a community of skeptics and went to her first conference, Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon a month later. [...] "I felt like I had found my people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing why he {{continued}} using the Guns N' Roses name, instead of labeling the upcoming album an 'Axl Rose solo album', Rose stated [...] "It is something I lived by before {{these guys were}} in it. And <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in Guns n' Roses before them, you know. I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesn't feel right in any way. I am not the person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. It's not an Axl Rose album, even if it's what I wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything they've got into singing and building. Maybe I'm helping steer it to {{what it should be}} built like." [...] Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to drug addictions and 'an effort from inside the band to destroy him', stating [...] "There was an effort to bring me down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," [...] and that he [...] "needed to take control to survive". Rose also described the dissolution as [...] "a divorce".|$|E
60|$|But <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> too, just as {{important}} as the Whimsies, whom the clever old Nome had determined to win to his side.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny laughed. [...] "I suppose <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> too, {{that had}} romantic {{attachments}} for Miss Costigan," [...] she said: [...] "I don't {{want to hear}} about 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not remarkably {{handsome}} and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the café," [...] Kit replied. [...] "Anyhow, I don't {{want to get}} a jealous señorita's knife in my back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! not so loud. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> lodging in the house. Never {{mind about}} {{telling me what}} you heard; it only irritates you to no purpose. I can guess that they had discovered--" ...|$|R
60|$|But the miscreant {{was evidently}} on the watch, Briot still lingered {{on the top}} of the stairs, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{sleeping}} in the house, and St. Genis suddenly realised that his purpose would not be quite so easy of execution as he had hot-headedly supposed.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in {{and around}} Thorbury, who very much wanted to know {{something}} about the young man at Cobhurst, but this desire was interfered with {{by the fact that the}} young man was not yet at Cobhurst, and did not seem to be in a hurry to get there.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} {{a quarter of an hour}} after this when Kitty {{proposed}} that we should go out to the front of the house; it would look queer if any of the servants should come by and see us sitting together like that. I had forgotten that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the world, but I went with her.|$|E
50|$|Besides the {{aforementioned}} ethnic groups, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> from <b>other</b> parts of Kenya who <b>are</b> <b>there</b> working mostly {{for the government}} and business. Muslims, Christians and adherents of traditional religions all inhabit the town.|$|R
60|$|And <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{who will}} tell you that Greek art is fine, because it is not true; and carves a lion's skin so as to look not at all like a lion's skin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{never mind}} her; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> very talkative {{in this town}} besides your wife. Deacon Abraham's house is half a mile {{out of your way}} home from Mr. Jordan's. How did you get there?" ...|$|R
60|$|His voice ceased. He did not cry, {{only went}} on {{speaking}} monotonously. Clara wanted to run. She looked round. There was the black, re-echoing shore, {{the dark sky}} down on her. She got up terrified. She wanted to be where there was light, where <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> She wanted {{to be away from}} him. He sat with his head dropped, not moving a muscle.|$|E
6000|$|After she {{had left}} Florence Gilbert Osmond met Madame Merle at the Countess Gemini's. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> present; the Countess's drawing-room was usually well filled, and the talk had been general, {{but after a while}} Osmond left his place and came and sat on an ottoman half-behind, half-beside Madame Merle's chair. [...] "She wants me to go to Rome with her," [...] he remarked in a low voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{went down}} to the town with Jarge, who was going to fetch some things I wanted. He left her looking in at a shop window while he went inside. They were some time serving him as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the shop. Jenny got tired, as she says, of waiting, and seeing some {{pictures}} in a window {{on the other side of}} the street started to run across, and her foot slipped, and--and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Age, my dear Mrs. Macallan, is {{a purely}} {{relative}} expression," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are some people}} who are never young, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who <b>are</b> never old. I am one of the <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> Au revoir!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must understand, Mr. Low, that Mr. Finn {{is a man}} horribly hated {{by certain}} enemies. That wretched Mr. Bonteen hated his very name. But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who think very {{differently}} of him. He must be saved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, mynheer," [...] I interrupted; [...] "but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in {{the world}} besides yourself--Hernan Pereira, for example, if he lives. Still, I am {{not the only one}} {{concerned}} in this matter. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> Marie yonder. Shall I call her?" ...|$|R
60|$|She gave {{a dinner}} {{to which she}} invited her most select friends. Mr. and Mrs. Perley were there, and the Misses Thorpedyke, two maiden ladies who {{constituted}} {{the family of the}} highest social pretension of Plainton. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who were richer, but Miss Eleanor Thorpedyke, now a lady of nearly seventy, and her sister Barbara, some ten years younger, belonged to the very best family {{in that part of the}} country, and were truly the aristocrats of the place.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the place, ten altogether, so Birkin {{had found}} out: two artists, three students, {{a man and}} wife, and a Professor and two daughters--all Germans. The four English people, being newcomers, sat in their coign of vantage to watch. The Germans peeped in at the door, called a word to the waiter, and went away again. It was not meal-time, so they did not come into this dining-room, but betook themselves, when their boots were changed, to the Reunionsaal.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened his}} mouth {{slightly}} and lifted his head up and down. She saw in the movement how affectionate he was, and in his own way, how emotional. He loved them all. She put her hand to his. He gave her hand one sudden squeeze, of physical understanding, then left it {{as if nothing had}} happened. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the carriage with them. She could not help feeling how sudden and lovely that moment's grasp of his hand was: so warm, so whole.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he {{answered}} smiling, [...] "that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{who would have}} something to say about that. Your stepmother is already anxious. I have promised that you shall be back at the Hall by ten o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is a shame," [...] said Miriam, [...] "that you should be driving to town alone, when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who wish so much to go, and you have no use at all for that empty seat." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Gauls, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> living in Gaul, such as the Greeks and Phoenicians who had established outposts such as Massilia (present-day Marseille) along the Mediterranean coast. Also, along the southeastern Mediterranean coast, the Ligures had merged with the Celts to form a Celto-Ligurian culture.|$|R
60|$|As {{they sat}} in the tramcar, she leaned her heavy {{shoulder}} against him, and he took her hand. He felt himself coming round from the anaesthetic, beginning to breathe. Her ear, half-hidden among her blonde hair, was near to him. The temptation to kiss it was almost too great. But <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> on top of the car. It still remained to him to kiss it. After all, he was not himself, he was some attribute of hers, like the sunshine that fell on her.|$|E
6000|$|Adam was not {{the only}} guest invited to come upstairs on other grounds than the amount he contributed to the rent-roll. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the two parishes who derived dignity from their {{functions}} rather than from their pocket, and of these Bartle Massey was one. His lame walk was rather slower than usual on this warm day, so Adam lingered behind when the bell rang for dinner, that he might walk up with his old friend; for he was a little too shy to join the Poyser party on this public occasion. Opportunities of getting to Hetty's side would be sure to turn up {{in the course of the}} day, and Adam contented himself with that for he disliked any risk of being [...] "joked" [...] about Hetty--the big, outspoken, fearless man was very shy and diffident as to his love-making.|$|E
6000|$|The {{third day}} after Lyon's return to London was a Sunday, {{so that he}} could go and ask Mrs. Capadose for luncheon. She had given him in the spring a general {{invitation}} to do so and he had availed himself of it several times. These had been the occasions (before he sat to him) when he saw the Colonel most familiarly. Directly after the meal his host disappeared (he went out, as he said, to call on his women) and the second half-hour was the best, even when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> Now, in the first days of December, Lyon had the luck to find the pair alone, without even Amy, who appeared but little in public. They were in the drawing-room, waiting for the repast to be announced, {{and as soon as he}} came in the Colonel broke out, 'My dear fellow, I'm delighted to see you! I'm so keen to begin again.' ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{character}} Adam Reichl possibly dies {{in a car}} accident and wakes up on unknown island in the middle of nowhere. He starts to explore and tries to find out where he is only to find that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the island seemingly from different time periods.|$|R
50|$|While Maximinian {{and his men}} {{prepare to}} leave, Crispus and Beroe arrive. The former captive princess {{explains}} that Licinia has confessed to Fausta’s machinations. Maximian suspects <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the grove and, when he bumps into Crispus, both become very suspicious {{of each other and}} brandish their swords.|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you," [...] he said, helping {{himself to a}} crumpet, [...] "there are some people with small incomes {{who seem to be}} always in funds, just as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> with large incomes who are always hard-up. The former are really rich, the latter really poor." ...|$|R
