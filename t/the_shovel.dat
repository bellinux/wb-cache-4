I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift <b>the</b> <b>shovel.</b> Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E

25|$|When {{the funeral}} service has ended, the mourners {{come forward to}} fill the grave. Symbolically, this gives the mourners closure as they observe, or {{participate}} in, the filling of the grave site. One custom is for all people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the antithesis of death to life and that this use of <b>the</b> <b>shovel</b> is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 2004 an inbound train derailed at Makrellbekken {{after it}} struck a tractor with a snowplow. The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was a wind gust blowing snow against the tractor, disorienting the driver and causing him to drive {{too close to the}} platform edge with <b>the</b> <b>shovel</b> sticking out just as the train arrived. The only injury, to the train driver, was minor. The report was critical of the metro's safety routines, pointing out that the company had failed to sufficiently caution the subcontractor of the hazards with the snow clearing task.|$|E
25|$|The MacAdam shield-shovel {{resembled the}} {{standard}} portable infantry spade of its day in both size and shape. In {{order to stop}} or deflect enemy fire, thicker steel {{was used in the}} construction of the blade; it measured at three-sixteenths of an inch thick. Heavy steel was also used to make the shovel's detachable handle which measured four feet in length. Unique to the shield-shovel was the inclusion of a 3.5 by 2 inch sight-hole in the blade. <b>The</b> <b>shovel</b> was intended to be used as a shield by folding the handle to ~90° toward the concave side of the blade, exposing the spike that ran along the handle opposite the blade. The spike would then be driven into the ground, resulting in the blade standing vertically and the handle resting on the ground behind it as a brace.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, 25,000 shield-shovels {{were ordered}} {{and shipped to}} Europe {{for use by the}} 1st Canadian Division. Preliminary tests, however, {{revealed}} that the shovel’s blade was incapable of stopping even small caliber bullets. Its value as a digging tool was also questioned as soldiers commented against the shovel’s weight, its inability to be easily carried, {{and the fact that the}} blade was poor for shoveling loose soil as it contained a large sight-hole. With such a reputation, several high-ranking Canadian and British military officials refused to press the instrument into service. With these developments, an executive order was eventually issued for the shovels to be reduced to scrap. A total sum of $1,400 was recovered in the salvage; a figure far less than the original contract price, which tagged each MacAdam shield-shovel at $1.35. Despite being condemned by the military, a small following of Canadian snipers continued to use <b>the</b> <b>shovel.</b> Aware of the tool’s limitations, they preferred to use them in a collective series for added protection.|$|E
25|$|Ubisoft {{executive}} Tony Key {{said that}} although the game was designed for the Wii U, the company might bring it to other platforms. Following several leaks, Ubisoft confirmed Zombi for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developed by Straight Right (who had developed Mass Effect 3 Wii U version), it was released on August 18, 2015. The game {{is similar to the}} original, with minor updates and enhancements. Second-screen gameplay was moved to the main screen, only appearing when required. Although the cricket bat was the only melee weapon in ZombiU, Zombi added two weapons. <b>The</b> <b>shovel</b> has a longer range and the ability to hit more than one zombie at a time. The second (a nailed bat) inflicts more damage, has a higher critical-hit chance and can also hit more than one enemy at a time. ZombiU flashlight can switch to a wider, further-reaching beam which uses more battery life and increases the risk of attracting zombies. The flashlight must be kept off for 30 seconds to recharge, requiring that its use be planned. Zombi has only the solo campaign, without local multiplayer or online single-player features. The boxed game was released on January 21, 2016.|$|E
