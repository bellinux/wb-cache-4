5|$|While a {{graduate}} student and member of TMRC, Dennis introduced his students to the TX-0 on loan to MIT indefinitely from Lincoln Laboratory. In the spring of 1959, McCarthy taught <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>course</b> in programming that MIT offered to freshmen. Outside classes, Kotok, David Gross, Peter Samson, Robert A. Saunders and Robert A. Wagner, all friends from TMRC, reserved time on the TX-0. They {{were able to use}} the TX-0 as a personal, single-user tool rather than a batch processing system, thanks to Dennis, faculty advisors and John McKenzie, the operations manager.|$|E
5|$|Wood Badge in the United States of America is {{the highest}} level of adult Scout leader {{training}} available. It was first presented in England by the founder of Scouting, Baden Powell, and he introduced the program into the United States during a visit in 1936. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>course</b> was held at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation, but Americans did not fully adopt Wood Badge until 1948. The National BSA Council staff provided direct leadership to the program through 1958, when the increased demand encouraged them to permit local councils to deliver the training.|$|E

5|$|Wood Badge was {{introduced}} to America by Baden-Powell and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>course</b> was held in 1936 at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation, the Boy Scouts of America national training center until 1979. Despite this early first course, Wood Badge was not formally adopted in the United States until 1948 {{under the guidance of}} Bill Hillcourt who became national Deputy Camp Chief of the United States. Today the national training center of the Boy Scouts of America is the Philmont Training Center, which hosts a few camps each year. Nearly all Wood Badge courses are held throughout the country at local council camps under the auspices of each BSA region.|$|E
5|$|They added American touches to the course. They {{used the}} names of American birds for patrol names; {{challenged}} patrols {{to make their own}} flags instead of using store-bought flags; introduced patrol totems and signatures; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol's name was mentioned. Each member took turns as the patrol leader, and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections. The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and how to handle the U.S. flag. The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp. Other American features included a program and a service patrol, a cracker barrel after each evening's event, a feast, and other ceremonies. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>course,</b> begun on July 31, 1948, was attended by 29 men from 12 states. Although it rained on four of the nine days, the Scouters were excited by the experience and enthusiastic about sharing it with others.|$|E
5|$|When No.1 BFTS {{formed at}} Uranquinty on 1December 1951, it had 377 staff, 37 Tiger Moths and 37 Wirraways, and {{came under the}} control of Headquarters Southern Area (Training Command from 1October 1953). The first pilots' course {{commenced}} on 1April 1952, and graduated on 1August. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>course</b> of graduates from No.1 IFTS transferred in the same month. As well as RAAF pilots, No.1 BFTS trained students from the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm. In February 1953, a prototype CAC Winjeel, designed and manufactured in Australia, arrived at the school to undergo trials. From January 1956 to February 1957, the Winjeel gradually replaced both the Tiger Moth and the Wirraway as No.1 BFTS's training aircraft. As well as these aircraft, Link Trainer instrument flying simulators were employed at the school. By November 1954, following the end of the Korean War, the RAAF's need for further aircrew to fulfill its international obligations had eased and {{the decision was made to}} combine the syllabus of No.1 IFTS with No.1 BFTS starting in January 1955, after which No.1 IFTS was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>course</b> of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
5|$|No.1 ITS's inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Wing Commander Wilfred Lampe. Tiger Moths began arriving at Archerfield on 4January 1952, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>course</b> commenced two days later. It graduated on 27March, having flown {{a total of}} some 1,000 hours. The unit was renamed No.1 Initial Flying Training School on 28May. As well as RAAF pilots, the school trained students from the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm, and gave Air Training Corps cadets flying experience. Six of its Tiger Moths went on a recruiting drive around Kingaroy and Bundaberg in August 1952, the same month that its first graduates commenced {{the next phase of}} their training at No.1 BFTS. Those students selected to be navigators rather than pilots went on to the School of Air Navigation at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. No.1 IFTS was responsible for staging aerial pageants as part of Air Force Week in September 1952, and again in September 1953. Ground staff from the school won the Hewitt Trophy for small arms proficiency held at Liverpool, New South Wales, in December 1953. In April 1954, the Tiger Moths practised bombing and strafing troops in an exercise with the Australian Army's 9th Battalion.|$|E
