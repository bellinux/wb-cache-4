5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Saw III, Twisted Pictures and Brash Entertainment {{announced}} they were planning to create a game based on the Saw property. Although no release was confirmed, they stated that the game would most likely release alongside Saw IV. Originally, Brash Entertainment was going to develop the game and co-publish it with Twisted Pictures, the producers of all of the Saw films. The game's plot was originally <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> of the first Saw film, with the player assuming control of various characters in Jigsaw's traps, but this was later changed as development progressed.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{continued}} to grow in military sophistication and comfort during the 12th century, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the complexity and length of sieges in England. While in Ireland and Wales castle architecture continued <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> of England, after the death of Alexander III the trend in Scotland moved away from the construction of larger castles towards the use of smaller tower houses. The tower house style would also be adopted in the north of England and Ireland in later years. In North Wales Edward I built a sequence of militarily powerful castles after the destruction of the last Welsh polities in the 1270s. By the 14th century castles were combining defences with luxurious, sophisticated living arrangements and heavily landscaped gardens and parks.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{outside of}} Portugal and Spain, breeding, showing and {{registration}} of both Lusitanos and Andalusians are often closely linked. One {{example is the}} Australasian Lusitano Horse Association of Australasia (LHAA), which shares responsibility for the Purebred Iberian Horse (an Andalusian/Lusitano cross) with the Australasia Andalusian Association, as well as hosting a combined National Show for the two breeds in Australia. The LHAA was formed in 2003 to register and promote the Lusitano breed in Australia and New Zealand, and in June 2005 {{signed an agreement with}} their parent organization, the Portuguese Associação Portuguesa de Criadores do Cavalo Puro Sangue Lusitano, <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> association's rules and regulations. The LHAA maintains two studbooks (for the purebred Lusitano and the purebred Iberian) and a crossbred registry for horses with one Lusitano parent. An example of a combined registry is the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA).|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|PA 997 intersects PA 433, where PA 997 Truck {{returns to}} the route, and turns north-northwest to run between the Letterkenny Army Depot {{to the west and}} {{agricultural}} areas to the east. The road crosses into Letterkenny Township and continues north and then northwest through a mix of fields and woods with some development along the eastern border of the military installation. The route curves northeast and heads into the community of Pleasant Hall, where it passes homes and crosses PA 533. From here, PA 997 runs through a mix of farmland and woodland, crossing the Conodoguinet Creek into Lurgan Township. The road continues north and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 433 near the community of Lurgan. The route runs through more rural land and curves northwest, passing over the Conodoguinet Creek again and heading back into Letterkenny Township. PA 997 curves north and passes some residential development before heading into wooded areas and crossing the creek a third time and reentering Lurgan Township. At this point, the route heads into the community of Roxbury and comes to a junction with PA 641, where it turns east <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> route, passing homes. PA 997 splits from PA 641 by turning northeast onto Cumberland Highway, heading through a mix of farmland and woods with some homes a short distance to the southeast of Blue Mountain. Farther northeast, the route passes businesses and comes to a ramp providing access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) at the Blue Mountain interchange. After this, the road curves east and runs through the community of McKinney.|$|E

5|$|Six {{hours after}} being {{declared}} a tropical disturbance, MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status, {{and the agency}} predicted the system would eventually reach peak winds of 130km/h (80mph) before moving ashore. Its track was expected <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> of another tropical cyclone east of Madagascar, which would become Tropical Storm Eric. Late on January18, the system briefly became disorganized, only to re-organize and attain tropical storm status on January19; upon doing so, the Malagasy Weather Service named it Fanele. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm. The agency noted uncertainty in the future track of the storm, due to interaction with Tropical Storm Eric east of Madagascar, and Fanele was located within an area of weak steering currents. Tropical Storm Fanele quickly strengthened, developing an eye feature, and late on January19 the JTWC estimated sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph); the agency predicted further strengthening to peak winds of 140km/h (85mph). Around that time, Fanele began rapid deepening under very favorable environmental conditions, and the MFR upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status with winds of 150km/h (95mph). Upon attaining tropical cyclone status, the MFR forecast Fanele would intensify further to peak winds of 185km/h (115mph).|$|E

25|$|Sir John Johnstone became Smith’s patron and {{employed}} {{him as his}} Land Steward at Hackness. Johnstone was President of the Scarborough Philosophical Society which raised the money to build the Rotunda and consulted Smith as to the Museum’s design. Still in his twenties, Sir John was an intellectual leader in Scarborough in the 1820s and a staunch supporter of Smith and his ideas. He donated the Hackness stone of which the Rotunda Museum is built. Smith had seen a rotunda in London and instructed the architect, Richard Sharp of York, <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> design. The Rotunda Museum was built to Smith’s design suggestion and the original display of fossils illustrated his ideas.
