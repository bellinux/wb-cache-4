25|$|Before the {{formation}} of Malayan Union in 1946, the territories were not placed under a single unified administration, with the exception during the immediate post-war period when a British military became the <b>temporary</b> <b>administrator</b> of Malaya. Instead, British Malaya comprised the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States, and the Unfederated Malay States. Under British rule, Malaya {{was one of the}} most profitable territories of the Empire, being the world's largest producer of tin and later rubber. Japan ruled a part of Malaya as a single unit from Singapore during the Second World War.|$|E

2500|$|The occupiers, {{especially}} Germans, regarded Carp as a friend, or, {{according to}} researcher Lisa Meyerhofer, [...] "a natural ally." [...] Through negotiator Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, the invading force initially called on Carp and Maiorescu {{to join their}} effort of pacifying Romania; both Junimists promptly rejected this offer. Carp himself referred to the project as [...] "nonsense", and bluntly refused to be contacted by Maiorescu for further deliberation on the subject. Soon however, {{a core group of}} [...] "Carpist" [...] supporters, headed by the bureaucrat Lupu Kostaki, became the nominal civil administration of occupied Romania. The exercise of powers by the new apparatus varied greatly: Kostaki, appointed Verweser (<b>temporary</b> <b>administrator)</b> at the Interior Ministry, could only advise on some policy matters, while Al.

5000|$|Almost immediately, the Reich's {{ambassador}} to the Holy See, Diego von Bergen, {{made it clear that}} Nazi Germany would like to see German prelates made <b>temporary</b> <b>administrators</b> of the sees whose bishops had been deposed. Prelate Franz Hartz, German Territorial Prelature of Schneidemühl, was suggested by the ambassador as administrator for Gniezno-Poznań, Danzig's Bishop Carl Maria Splett for Chełmno-Pelplin, and Breslau's Archbishop Adolf Bertram for Katowice, which had been disentangled from his see in 1922. According to Monsignore Domenico Tardini, Pius XII [...] "acknowledging the soundness of this proposal, has decided to postpone it". Except for Splett, the Holy See did not take up any of the proposals.|$|R

Ireland's population decreased rapidly, from 8.2 million in 1841 {{to less than}} 4.5 million in 1901, mostly due to the Great Famine. At the same time, around 15 million emigrants left the United Kingdom in the Victorian era and settled mostly in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Not only did the rapidly expanding British Empire attract immigrants, it also attracted <b>temporary</b> <b>administrators,</b> soldiers, missionaries and businessmen who on their return talked up the Empire {{as a part of}} greater Britain.|$|R
60|$|Italy, {{in those}} days, {{was divided into}} the parties of Guelphs and Ghibellines; the former, the advocates of general church-ascendancy and local government; the latter, of the pretensions of the Emperor of Germany, {{who claimed to be}} the Roman Cæsar, and {{paramount}} over the Pope. In Florence, the Guelphs had for a long time been so triumphant as to keep the Ghibellines in a state of banishment. Dante was born and bred a Guelph: he had twice borne arms for his country against Ghibelline neighbours; and now, at the age of thirty-five, in the ninth of his marriage, and last of his residence with his wife, he was appointed chief of the <b>temporary</b> <b>administrators</b> of affairs, called Priors;--functionaries who held office only for two months.|$|R

50|$|Although Young was {{appointed}} to the dual roles as colonial secretary of British Columbia (B.C.) and acting Colonial Secretary of Vancouver Island, his colonial administrative career was not particularly successful; the position of permanent Secretary of Vancouver Island was never confirmed. Vancouver Is. and B.C. were separated as colonies in 1863 and then re-united in 1866;his father-in-law James Douglas had retired as Governor in 1864 and returned to Scotland; they kept close ties. Young seems to have been unjustly elbowed out of his <b>temporary</b> <b>Administrator's</b> appointment by 1869, for which loss which he was never compensated. He {{was appointed}} financial secretary of Jamaica and returned to England after an attack of Yellow fever in 1872. Five years later in 1884 he was named a CMG and appointed governor of the Gold Coast in Africa. He died there on 25 April 1885.|$|R
5000|$|The California pioneer died intestate, with no living {{relatives}} in California or the United States. In 1848 his estate was assumed devalued and in debt. The public discovery {{of gold in}} the American River valley and upon his extensive land holdings increased the actual value of his estate dramatically. His waterfront property in today's financial district of San Francisco would be valuable today. A complete inventory of his estate {{has yet to be}} quantified. [...] The court appointed <b>temporary</b> <b>administrators</b> of his estate because there were no probate laws in California at that time. By 1854, when the California State Legislature considered escheat {{to take control of the}} property, Leidesdorff's estate was worth well over one million dollars and multiple of millions of dollars in gold was mined off his land. When the Leidesdorff-Folsom partitioned estate was auctioned off in 1856, the property brought more than $1,445,000.|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{insolvency}} {{regulation is}} of decisive relevance for banks {{in terms of}} their secure operation and ability to recover outstanding claims from corporate clients. This topic {{has been the subject of}} many debates lately, as Hungarian corporate insolvency regulation has been undergoing reforms since 2003. One of the main objectives in this regard was to adopt new measures to improve the mediation of funds in the economy. This study introduces reviews leading to the reform, demonstrates the measures already adopted and those in the pipeline, and finally offers an assessment of the measures in general and from the perspective of financial stability. Reform measures adopted so far are favourable from the perspective of financial stability, since the international standards which have been introduced improve the secure operation of commercial banks when mediating funds.

50|$|On August 15, 1945, {{one week}} after the Potsdam Conference he created facts by {{establishing}} Polish administrators in these areas. The new government, almost as expected, began its campaign against the Church by withdrawing from the concordat and expelling the Papal Nuncio and refusing to accept the appointments by Cardinal Hlond.
