5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the current}} Laws, a captain may forfeit either of his side's innings. A {{forfeited}} innings shall {{be considered as}} a completed innings. Usually this happens in shorter competitive two-innings matches, where captains need to agree with each other how to set up the match so that there is a reasonable chance of a result. Winning a game gains a team considerably more points than drawing it, so captains are often willing to risk giving the opposition an opportunity to win that they otherwise would not have had as long as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> a similar opportunity in return.|$|E

25|$|Continuing {{weight loss}} may {{deteriorate}} into wasting, a vaguely defined condition called cachexia. Cachexia differs from starvation {{in part because}} it involves a systemic inflammatory response. It is associated with poorer outcomes. In the advanced stages of progressive disease, metabolism can change so that they lose weight even when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> what is normally regarded as adequate nutrition and the body cannot compensate. This leads to a condition called anorexia cachexia syndrome (ACS) and additional nutrition or supplementation is unlikely to help. Symptoms of weight loss from ACS include severe weight loss from muscle rather than body fat, loss of appetite and feeling full after eating small amounts, nausea, anemia, weakness and fatigue.|$|E

The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney. Peter tells Zooey that he lent Sydney money and asks her if she knows why <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> married, since he had no answer to Sydney's question. Hurt and angry, Zooey leaves.|$|E
25|$|Higher male {{secondary}} school enrollment, {{per capita income}} and economic growth rate all had significant effects on reducing the chance of civil war. Specifically, a male {{secondary school}} enrollment 10% above the average reduced {{the chance of a}} conflict by about 3%, while a growth rate 1% higher than the study average resulted in a decline in the chance of a civil war of about 1%. The study interpreted these three factors as proxies for earnings forgone by rebellion, and therefore that lower forgone earnings encourage rebellion. Phrased another way: young males (who make up the vast majority of combatants in civil wars) are less likely to join a rebellion if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> an education or have a comfortable salary, and can reasonably assume that they will prosper in the future.|$|E

25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says there was {{something}} in the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that anything found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go and look for the device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E
