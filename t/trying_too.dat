5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was often given an eye for <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Crawford scored 232 against Somerset, his highest first-class score, as well as centuries against Derbyshire and Hampshire. The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to spin the ball. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.|$|E

It also <b>tries</b> <b>too</b> hard to be something more than it actually is".|$|R
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to be funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E

He wrote to Haig (20 April) cautioning against “determination to push on regardless of loss” and repeating Nivelle’s error of <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> much to “break the enemy’s front” and urged him instead to concentrate on “inflicting heavier losses on (the enemy) than one suffers oneself”. It is unclear that the letter had much effect as Haig appointed Gough, an aggressive cavalryman, to command the Ypres Offensive shortly after receiving it.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} Born This Way {{stems from the}} synthpop and dance-pop styles of her {{previous}} material while incorporating different forms of instrumentation from that on her previous releases, such as electronic rock and techno. It features {{a broader range of}} genres such as opera, heavy metal, disco, house and rock and roll while its lyrical topics include sexuality, religion, freedom, feminism, and individualism. Despite divided opinions among religious and conservative commentators, the album was well received by music critics, who praised the varying musical styles and Gaga's vocals; others felt Gaga was <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to please everyone through the album's self-empowerment message. Several publications included the album in their year-end best-of lists. Born This Way received three Grammy Award nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for Album of the Year.|$|E

Electro pop band Purple Crush also claimed that Carey used the hook from their 2013 song of the same name. Following the release of the album, [...] "Thirsty" [...] debuted on the South Korean International Gaon Single Chart at number 78 due to strong digital download sales. The song was included on Carey's 2014 tour, The Elusive Chanteuse Show.|$|E

500|$|Mike LeChevallier [...] of Slant {{magazine}} award {{the third}} season {{three and a}} half stars out of four. In his review, LeChevallier wrote that the series [...] "scores relatively high marks for storytelling, artwork, music, voice acting, and realization with its neatly wrapped, 11-minute packages of multicolored awesomeness." [...] He further complimented the show because he felt that [...] "it scarcely appears to be <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to attract attention, yet it does just that". He did note that [...] "the short-form format leaves some emotional substance to be desired", although he noted this was inevitable for a series with such short episodes.|$|E
500|$|While complimenting its {{performance}} and other unique features, The Verge believed that LG was <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard {{to compete with}} the Samsung Galaxy S4 by closely imitating its design, specifications, and emphasis on features instead of differentiating itself through further innovations.

Despite his overall praise of Yu Yu Hakusho, Divers noted in a review about one DVD release that the show [...] " [...] that fine line of a solid long running series or being a broken record".

500|$|... "Dancing {{with the}} Moonlit Knight" [...] {{evolved from a}} number of short piano pieces {{composed}} by Gabriel, which was combined with some of Hackett's guitar figures to make up the track. Gabriel added English-themed lyrics to counter the impression from the music press that Genesis were <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to appeal to the American audience, including references to Green Shield Stamps. Banks had upgraded to a new model of Mellotron and used the choir sound on the track. The track ends with a series of 12 string guitar figures that were originally supposed to segue into [...] "The Cinema Show" [...] to make a piece around 20 minutes in length, but this idea was dropped as the result was too comparable to [...] "Supper's Ready".|$|E
500|$|Radioland Murders {{received}} negative reviews with Rotten Tomatoes calculated a 24% {{approval rating}} based on 17 reviews collected. Roger Ebert criticized the film for containing too much slapstick comedy instead of subtle humor. Although he praised the art direction and visual effects, Ebert believed [...] "the movie just doesn't work. It's all action and no character, all situation and no comedy. The slapstick starts so soon and lasts {{so long that}} we don't {{have an opportunity to}} meet or care about the characters {{in a way that would}} make their actions funny." [...] Richard Schickel, writing in Time magazine gave a mixed review, mainly criticizing the film for its fast pacing. Caryn James of The New York Times dismissed the film for <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to pay homage to screwball comedy films of the 1930s.|$|E

[...] Writing for the same publication, Mike Wass wrote that he thought the solo version was better than the alternate version featuring Rich Homie Quan's rap verse, writing [...] "It's an improvement on the original.

Ty Burr of The Boston Globe found the characters sympathetic and realistic, and enjoyed the humor. The New York Times chief critic A. O. Scott praised the film for striking a balance between humor and sentimentality, writing, [...] "It's both funny and serious without <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard to be either, and by trying above all to be honest." [...] Peter Debruge described Jenny Slate as [...] "wildly funny" [...] in Variety, while Marc Mohan called her performance [...] "endearing and real" [...] in The Oregonian.

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic commented: [...] "'Umbrella' is [...] to date, {{delivering}} mammoth if spacious drums, {{a towering}} backdrop during the chorus, and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned – an ideal spot between <b>trying</b> <b>too</b> hard and boredom, like she might've been on her 20th take." [...] Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian, [...] "Umbrella" [...] is [...] "evidence" [...] that Rihanna's [...] "strict work ethic is paying off", {{adding that she}} [...] "delivers [...] an impassioned declaration of us-against-the-world devotion". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork, though he complimented the production, dismissed Rihanna's voice which [...] "takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill {{the space between the}} slow-tempo beats", adding that the song is [...] "uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics".|$|E
500|$|Nardine Saad from Los Angeles Times {{asserted}} that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was less shock-provoking than her previous releases.

Similar sentiments were expressed by fellow NME writer Dan Martin, who found the track to be gleaming, calling it the [...] "most ecstatic pop serenade" [...] Gaga has ever come up with. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy commented that the song is a [...] "straight-up fists-in-the-air feel-good anthem that is less cheesy than 'Born This Way' but equally (if not more) euphoric."
