5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, <b>tunas,</b> bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, <b>tunas,</b> and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including ponyfishes, grunters, <b>tunas,</b> and herring. Cephalopods are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the lagoon of Mischief Reef, South China Sea to test the feasibility of feeding and rearing wild caught yellowfin <b>tuna</b> Thunnus albacares and skipjack <b>tuna</b> Katsuwonus pelamis juveniles in small, deep sea-water, cages. Fish started active feeding four days after transfer to the rearing cage. Initial feeding depth between yellowfin <b>tuna</b> and skipjack <b>tuna</b> was not significantly different (P > 0. 05). The initial feeding depth for yellowfin <b>tuna</b> juveniles was 2. 97 ± 1. 09 m, and skipjack <b>tuna</b> fed at 2. 95 ± 0. 77 m. After the 30 day rearing experiment specific growth rates of yellowfin <b>tuna</b> and skipjack <b>tuna</b> were: 0. 25 ± 0. 02 %/day and 0. 32 ± 0. 03 %/day, respectively; survival rate of yellowfin <b>tuna</b> was 100 %, and the survival rate of skipjack <b>tuna</b> was 82. 6 %. The estimated feed conversion ratio was 9. 73 in this study. The results of this study provide practical data for culturing wild caught yellowfin <b>tuna</b> and skipjack <b>tuna</b> juveniles in sea cages...|$|R
5|$|The {{hurricane}} warning for Antigua, Barbuda, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis was discontinued at 1200UTC on August22, {{as was the}} tropical storm warning for Dominica. Three hours later, a {{hurricane warning}} was issued for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and another hurricane watch was posted for the central Bahamas. Additionally, the hurricane warning for Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, was discontinued. At 2100UTC on August22, a hurricane watch was issued in Cuba for the provinces of Holguín and Las <b>Tunas,</b> while a tropical storm warning was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince. The hurricane warning for the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was lowered to a tropical storm warning, before being canceled early on August23. Additionally, all watches and warning east of the United States Virgin Islands were discontinued. On August23, a hurricane warning was issued for the central Bahamas and Cuba in the provinces of Guantanamo, Holguín, and Las <b>Tunas.</b> A hurricane watch was put into effect for the northwestern Bahamas and Cuba in Camagüey and Ciego de Ávila on the north coast and Santiago de Cuba and Granma on the south coast. By 1500UTC on August25, all of the remaining tropical cyclone watches and warnings were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to the disturbance brought locally heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula, with a maximum of 7.09inches (18cm) in Lázaro Cárdenas, Quintana Roo. The depression produced intense precipitation across central and eastern Cuba, peaking at 12.4inches (31.5cm) in Topes de Collantes. In Victoria de Las <b>Tunas,</b> a rainfall total of 8.6inches (21.8cm) set the new record most rainfall in 24hours. The rainfall caused flooding of rivers and lakes behind dams, and in some places, residents required rescue from the roofs of their houses. Officials forced the evacuation of 40,000people in several provinces, and across the country, the storm destroyed 1,860homes and damaged 16,500more. The flooding blocked mountainous highways in Santiago de Cuba Province, and in Las <b>Tunas</b> Province railway lines were damaged. Widespread crop damage occurred just {{two months after the}} Storm of the Century left similar heavy damage. The flooding damaged 87sugar production centers. The depression killed seven people in the country with another five missing, as reported by a newspaper on the day after the depression left the island. After the storm passed, the Cuban government activated the Civil Defense, while National Relief Services worked to rescue all people affected by the flooding.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the major}} groups of teleosts, the Elopomorpha, Clupeomorpha and Percomorpha (perches, <b>tunas</b> and many others) {{all have a}} {{worldwide}} distribution and are mainly marine; the Ostariophysi and Osteoglossomorpha are worldwide but mainly freshwater, the latter mainly in the tropics; the Atherinomorpha (guppies, etc.) have a worldwide distribution, both fresh and salt, but are surface-dwellers. In contrast, the Esociformes (pikes) are limited to freshwater in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Salmoniformes (salmon, trout) are found in both Northern and Southern temperate zones in freshwater, some species migrating {{to and from the}} sea. The Paracanthopterygii (cods, etc.) are Northern Hemisphere fish, with both salt and freshwater species.|$|E

5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white sharks, megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater stingrays, pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including billfishes, <b>tunas,</b> dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E
5|$|While {{large enough}} to perhaps be dangerous, the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its {{preference}} for deep water. This species is a bycatch of gillnet, bottom trawl, and deep-set pelagic longline fisheries (particularly those targeting tuna) {{in many parts of}} its range. It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil, shagreen, and fishmeal. Elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia, the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup. The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States, where it is listed as Prohibited Species under the 2007 Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic <b>tunas,</b> swordfish and sharks, or in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, <b>tunas,</b> eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E

40|$|In Spain, certain {{population-based}} {{studies have}} shown high blood mercury (Hg) levels due to the high consumption of fish. Some studies have stated {{that one of the}} most consumed fish in Spain is canned <b>tuna.</b> Different Spanish organisms consider that it is safe to consume canned <b>tuna</b> as it supposedly has a low mercury content, particularly in so-called light <b>tuna.</b> However, in Spain light <b>tuna</b> is mainly yellowfin and bigeye <b>tuna,</b> while in other countries it is mainly skipjack <b>tuna.</b> This study analyzed 36 cans of the most popular brands in Spain and examined the influence of the type of <b>tuna,</b> packaging medium (olive oil, sunflower seed oil, water or marinade), different brands, prices and expiration dates. Mercury concentrations (mg/kg) were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and thermal decomposition amalgamation. The medians observed were (mg/kg) : light tuna: 0. 314; IQR: 0. 205 - 0. 594, white tuna: 0. 338; IQR: 0. 276 - 0. 558, skipjack: 0. 311; IQR: 0. 299 - 0. 322, frigate tuna: 0. 219; IQR 0. 182 - 0. 257 and mackerel: 0. 042; IQR 0. 029 -  0. 074. We found statistically significant differences between white <b>tuna,</b> light <b>tuna</b> and mackerel (p = 0. 004); light <b>tuna</b> and mackerel (p = 0. 002) and white <b>tuna</b> and mackerel (p = 0. 006). However, we found no differences between white <b>tuna</b> and light <b>tuna,</b> or among packaging medium, brands, prices or expiration dates. The limit of 0. 500 mg/kg of mercury in canned <b>tuna</b> was exceeded by the following percentages of the cans: 33. 3 % of light <b>tuna,</b> 16. 7 % of white <b>tuna,</b> and 0 % of Skipjack, frigate <b>tuna</b> and mackerel. The mercury content of the cans of Spanish light <b>tuna</b> that were analyzed was variable and high. The results of this study indicate that stricter regulation of Hg in canned <b>tuna</b> is necessary.
