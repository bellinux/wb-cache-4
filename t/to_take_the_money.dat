In 1691, attempting to compromise Halifax, he discredited himself by the patronage of an informer named Fuller, soon proved an impostor. He was absent in 1692 when the Place Bill was thrown out. In 1693, Carmarthen presided in great state as Lord High Steward {{at the trial}} of Lord Mohun; and on 4 May 1694 he was created Duke of Leeds. The same year he supported the Triennial Bill, but opposed the new treason bill as weakening {{the hands of the}} executive. Meanwhile, fresh attacks were made upon him. He was accused unjustly of Jacobitism. In April 1695, he was impeached once more by the Commons on suspicion of having received a bribe of 5000 guineas to procure a new charter for the East India Company. Although he had not actually accepted the gold, he had allowed it to remain in his house for over a year, only returning it when the inquiry began. In his defense, while denying that he had intended <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> ("it had been left with him only to be counted by his secretary") and appealing to his past services, Leeds did not attempt to conceal the fact that according to his experience bribery was an acknowledged and universal custom in public business, and that he himself had been instrumental in obtaining money for others. Meanwhile, his servant, who was said to have been the intermediary between the Duke and the Company, fled the country; and with no evidence to convict, the proceedings fell apart.|$|E

500|$|The College of Arms {{produced}} two colours for the RLI, with Queen Elizabeth II giving final approval to a Queen's colour and a regimental colour on 15 July 1963. The {{first of these}} was a standard Union Flag design; the unit's name was marked on a circle, which was placed centrally and surmounted by a crown. The second {{was based on a}} dark green background and featured the regimental badge in its centre, surrounded by a wreath of flame lilies, Rhodesia's national flower, and topped, as with the Queen's colour, with the royal crown. The Battalion took part in Operation Zephyr {{during the second half of}} 1963, a counter-intimidation action against political agitators from the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). As with the previous posting to Kariba, little to no action was necessary; it was enough of a deterrent that troops were present. When the Federation broke up on the last day of 1963, members of the Federal Army could transfer to the Southern Rhodesian Army, request a posting to Northern Rhodesia, or leave the military altogether, receiving a monetary [...] "golden handshake" [...] if they chose the last option.

The family is visited by a representative of a game reserve, who says their acres of open land similar to African Savannah would be a good habitat for the elephant to live in. However, as the family is pondering what to do about Stampy, a wildlife poacher named Mr. Blackheart offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> but Lisa is against the idea — particularly since Mr. Blackheart openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks.

The family begins searching and finds them at the Springfield Tar Pits, where Homer gets stuck in one of the tar pits. Homer is freed by Stampy, and gratefully agrees to donate the elephant to a wildlife reserve.|$|E

[...] In 1925, {{he set out to}} do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million.

He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation. By March, he was traveling to Hollywood. The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays, was delighted by the new face on the scene—in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street's faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as [...] "exceedingly American" [...] (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: [...] "not Jewish," [...] in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's [...] "background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood." ...|$|E
