In December 2006, NBC expanded this selection to include every episode of the season. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> offer every episode was made {{for only a few}} select shows and represents a marketing push on NBC's part.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Adidas as the NHL's uniform {{provider}} necessitated some slight {{changes in}} the Senators uniforms.

50|$|Bandai Visual's {{headquarters}} are in Ebisu, Shibuya, Tokyo. When Bandai Visual {{was established}} in August 1983, its headquarters was in Kōjimachi, Chiyoda, Tokyo.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> {{functional}} classification {{coincided with the}} rise of sports science. The first detailed international swimming sport science project was conducted at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming. Henceforth sports science became the driver of both performance and classification.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{congregation}} are disputed; its establishment in 1885 {{may have been a}} re-organization of a congregation founded in 1860. Located initially close to the Romanian quarter at 70 Hester Street, and later situated at the heart of it with <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Rivington Street, the synagogue was the preferred house of worship for the quarter's inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|When Ernestine {{was three}} years old, <b>the</b> family <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Verona. In 1866, at the {{outbreak}} of the Austro-Prussian War, <b>the</b> family <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Prague, where she was schooled at the Ursuline Convent.

5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Exeter, Leofric {{worked to}} {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was {{a supporter of the}} cult of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E

5|$|Before {{joining the}} Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, {{then at the}} Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club {{returned}} to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for {{the next twenty years}} (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> north London in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Llandudno to Fred and Rose Southall, he was the middle child of three boys. Southall played youth {{football}} for his school team and the Llandudno Swifts, where he played alongside Joey Jones. He was educated at Ysgol John Bright, though left without any qualifications at age 16. At age 14 he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered {{a chance to play}} for the youth team of Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Düsseldorf, but decided against <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Germany. The Swifts were a poor side that were regularly beaten heavily, though the near constant barrage of shots he faced enabled Southall to improve on his shot-stopping skills.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E
