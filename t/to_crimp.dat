5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way <b>to</b> <b>crimp</b> the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How <b>to</b> <b>crimp</b> the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

50|$|French wire, {{also known}} as bullion or gimp, is a fine coil of silver or gold-filled wire used by {{jewellers}} to conceal beading wire next <b>to</b> <b>crimps</b> and clasps.

50|$|One of {{the earlier}} efforts to obtain better {{high-velocity}} performance involves placing a very shallow cup of copper alloy over {{the base of the}} bullet.

30|$|Identifying {{and keeping}} yarn tension {{variation}} {{as low as}} possible is important in textile processes. In weaving process, it is desired to obtain constant uniform warp tension across the width of the warp. Since during fabric formation, low warp tension creates clinging that causes unclear passage for the filling. While high tension increases yarn breaks. Detecting and controlling the optimum warp tension will maximize the weaving efficiency, improves fabric quality, fabric dimensional stability due to better ratio of warp <b>crimp</b> <b>to</b> weft <b>crimp</b> and enhances the uniformity of color shade (Gahide 2001). The running tension should be at a value neither to over-elongate nor to entangle the yarn (Eskew 2006).|$|R
50|$|The primary hazard of {{pyrotechnic}} {{blasting caps}} {{is that for}} proper usage, the fuse must be inserted and then crimped into place by crushing {{the base of the}} cap around the fuse. If the tool used <b>to</b> <b>crimp</b> the cap is used too close to the explosives, the primary explosive compound can detonate during crimping. A common hazardous practice is crimping caps with one's teeth; an accidental detonation can cause serious injury to the mouth.|$|E

50|$|Most {{frangible}} bullets {{are subject}} to brittle failure upon striking a hard target.

Brittle failure may occur at subsonic velocity. Attempting <b>to</b> <b>crimp</b> a brittle frangible bullet into the cartridge case may break the bullet. Brittle frangible bullets may break during the self-loading cycle of semi-automatic firearms; and those fired from revolvers often break as the bullet encounters the barrel forcing cone after leaving the cylinder.|$|E

2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps. [...] The purpose of all such primer <b>crimps</b> is <b>to</b> make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition <b>to</b> <b>crimps,</b> <b>to</b> provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|R
