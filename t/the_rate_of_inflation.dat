40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} deriving <b>the</b> real interest <b>rate</b> and <b>the</b> expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> from <b>the</b> market information contained in indexed government bonds. It also discusses the implications and potential use for monetary policy of the information derived about <b>the</b> real interest <b>rate</b> and <b>the</b> expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> In theory, <b>the</b> real interest <b>rate</b> represents <b>the</b> marginal product of capital or <b>the</b> discount <b>rate</b> used in intertemporal market exchanges. Therefore, it acts to signal conditions in the real economy. <b>The</b> expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> represents <b>the</b> average expectation of market participants about future inflation. Therefore, it affects the economic decisions of market participants. It contains information about the judgment of market players, which is useful as a leading indicator of the future price level. This paper uses data on U. K. government-indexed bonds. It shows that the derived real interest <b>rate</b> and <b>the</b> expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> provide very useful information for monetary policy. This paper also shows that the Fisher equation and the rational expectations hypothesis are incompatible, and that <b>the</b> expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> obtained from <b>the</b> Fisher equation is far more stable than <b>the</b> realized <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> and <b>the</b> expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> obtained from <b>the</b> rational expectations hypothesis. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, {{and he had to}} take responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This had an impact on him: thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He had to take care of his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E

40|$|New Keynesian models {{rely heavily}} on two {{workhorse}} models of nominal inertia - price contracts of random duration (Calvo, 1983) and price adjustment costs (Rotemberg, 1982) - to generate a meaningful role for monetary policy. These alternative descriptions of price stickiness are often used interchangeably since, to a first order of approximation they imply an isomorphic Phillips curve and, if the steady-state is efficient, identical objectives for the policy maker {{and as a result}} in an LQ framework, the same policy conclusions. In this paper we compute time-consistent optimal monetary policy in bench-mark New Keynesian models containing each form of price stickiness.

40|$|Prominent {{among the}} many {{competing}} explana-tions that have been advanced to account for foreign exchange <b>rate</b> movements in <b>the</b> post-Bretton Woods era <b>of</b> floating exchange <b>rates</b> is <b>the</b> so-called pur-chasing power parity (PPP) theory. One of the most popular, simple, and durable explanations <b>of</b> exchange <b>rate</b> behavior, <b>the</b> purchasing power parity doctrine holds that currencies are valued for what they will buy. Therefore the relative external value of two currencies, i. e., <b>the</b> exchange <b>rate</b> between them, is determined by their relative internal purchas-ing powers {{as measured by the}} ratio of the general price levels in the two countries concerned. From this it follows that changes in relative national price levels determine changes in <b>the</b> exchange <b>rate.</b> In particular, <b>the</b> theory predicts that <b>the</b> percentage <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exchange <b>rate</b> will tend to equal the differential between <b>the</b> relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> price <b>inflation</b> at home and abroad. Thus if <b>the</b> domestic <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> in <b>the</b> U. S. is, say, five percentage points higher than <b>the</b> comparable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> in Switzerland, <b>the</b> theory maintains that the dollar will tend to depreciate on the foreign exchanges at a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> five percent relative to the Swiss franc. It follows from the theory that the way to strengthen a cur-rency’s external value is to strengthen its internal value by reducing <b>the</b> domestic <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation.</b> In terms <b>of</b> the preceding example, the way to arrest the fall of the dollar relative to the Swiss franc is to bring <b>the</b> U. S. <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> down into equality with <b>the</b> lower Swiss <b>rate.</b> With both currencies experiencing <b>the</b> same <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> (or fall in internal purchasing power), their relative purchasing power will remain unchanged and <b>the</b> exchange <b>rate</b> will stabilize. <b>The</b> foregoing view is scarcely new. Rather it is the product of at least 175 years of past theorizing about the connection between money, prices, and exchange rates. It is no exaggeration to say that the PPP doctrine has attracted the attention of some of the leading monetary theorists of all time, includ...|$|R
