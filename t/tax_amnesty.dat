50|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> is a limited-time {{opportunity}} for a specified group of taxpayers to pay a defined amount, in exchange for forgiveness of a tax liability (including interest and penalties) relating to a previous tax period or periods and without fear of criminal prosecution. It typically expires when some authority begins a tax investigation of the past-due tax. In some cases, legislation extending amnesty also imposes harsher penalties on those who are eligible for amnesty but do not take it. <b>Tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> is one of voluntary compliance strategies to increase tax base and tax revenue. <b>Tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> is different from other voluntary compliance strategies in part where <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> usually waives the taxpayers' tax liability.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical model and empirical evidence {{to explain the}} occurrence of <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties.</b> We treat amnesties as endogenous, resulting from a strategic game between many tax payers discounting future payments from punishment and a government that trades off {{costs and benefits of}} amnesty programmes. From the model we derive hypotheses about the factors that should influence the occurrence of <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties.</b> For our empirical test we rely on amnesty information from US states between 1981 and 2011. In line with the theoretical model, our empirical findings suggest that the likelihood of amnesties is mainly driven by a government's fiscal requirements and the taxpayers' expectations on future amnesties...|$|R

At the same time, time-limited amnesties are often repeated or in some countries even permanent amnesty laws exist. When <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties</b> are, however, anticipated, they can serve as an insurance against a rise in the detection probability, potentially leading to less and not more tax compliance. We test the relevance of this insurance effect in an experimental tax game and find that the overall tax compliance actually decreases by about 9 percent because of this effect...|$|R

40|$|Tax {{compliance}} {{has been}} studied in traditional public economics by heavily relying on deterrence {{as the most important}} compliance-increasing factor. This model of tax evasion is however challenged by inconclusive empirical evidence also pointing to the importance of tax morale as the individual’s intrinsic motivation to honestly pay taxes. Tax morale is, however, also endogenous and depends on an interaction of individual taxpayers and the state that could be perceived as a fiscal exchange in a broader sense. Such a fiscal exchange involves the provision of public services for the tax payments received, but it goes beyond purely monetary rewards as it is also affected by the way political decisions are made (procedural fairness) and by the way tax authorities treat taxpayers in tax audits (interactional fairness). The relationship between the taxpayers and the taxing state can thus be understood as an implicit or “psychological tax contract”, under which the government must balance strategies of deterrence with those of responsive regulation. In this paper, we extend the analytics of a “psychological tax contract” by considering the impact of <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties</b> on the contract. <b>Tax</b> Evasion, <b>Tax</b> <b>Amnesties,</b> Psychological <b>Tax</b> Contract...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of a policy of {{inducing}} in combating collusion within organizations, or in regulatory setups. In a mechanism-design problem involving a principal-supervisor-agent we show {{the role of}} endogenous selection of supervisory activity by the principal. One simple example is a mechanism in which the agent bypasses the supervisor and contracts directly with the principal in some states of the world. If collusion between supervisor and agent can occur only after they have decided to participate in the mechanism, this can costlessly eliminate collusion. This result is robust to alternative information structures, collusive behaviors and specification of agent's types. Applications include self-reporting of crimes, <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties,</b> immigration amnesties, work contracts specifying di¤erent degrees of discretion, mechanisms based on recommendation letters, embassies issuing immigration permits, and hiring committees.

The announcements of <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties</b> and incentives, aimed at feeding a virtuous circle which would amplify the effects of economic policy, proved ineffective. Their lack of credibility and their inability to dissipate uncertainty favoured saving rather than investment and consumption. No progress in structural reforms was made.

Growing conflict with labour unions hindered labour market and pension reform. ...|$|R
