It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people.

She had been {{enrolled}} at Columbia University during this period, and considered majoring in history as she became a sophomore, but left after about a year of total studies once sales of The Score went into the millions. In 1996, Hill responded to a false rumor on The Howard Stern Show that she had made a racist comment on MTV, saying [...] "How can I possibly be a racist? My music is universal music.

500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E

In 2004, Jesse Lacey told Chart magazine that he had written a [...] "few songs" [...] for the next album, commenting that [...] "the other guys love it already". He made mention of the pressure he felt with the [...] "loads of anticipation building up on my shoulders," [...] saying that he suffered from depression because of this; [...] "I'm getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and they say I write my best stuff when I'm in that state. Great, I'll spend the next six months all depressed and the rest of band will be excited, so that some good (material) might come out.

500|$|After the Liberal {{losses in}} the 1910 elections, ILP member and {{journalist}} Henry Brailsford helped organise a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage, which gathered 54 MPs from various parties. The group's Conciliation Bill {{looked to be a}} narrowly defined but still significant possibility to achieve the vote for women. Thus the WSPU agreed to suspend its support for window-breaking and hunger strikes while it was being negotiated. When {{it became clear that the}} bill would not pass, Pankhurst declared: [...] "If the Bill, in spite of our efforts, is killed by the Government, <b>then...</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say there is an end to the truce." [...] When it was defeated, Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 women to Parliament Square on 18 November. They were met with aggressive police response, directed by Home Secretary Winston Churchill: officers punched the marchers, twisted arms, and pulled on women's breasts. Although Pankhurst was allowed to enter Parliament, Prime Minister Asquith refused to meet her. The incident became known as Black Friday.|$|E

In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't think most people do [...] The fact is, is, like, we did do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun.

500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an A– grade. In a season review, Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly called the episode [...] "worthy", but {{noted that it}} was overshadowed by the show's [...] "ludicrous {{conspiracy}} plots". Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Release" [...] was a [...] "good episode" [...] because it [...] "presented conclusions to [...] long running stories in the series [...] featured the conclusion to John Doggett's personal trial, his quest for closure with his son's murder." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two argued that, because of the [...] "minimal emphasis" [...] Doggett's son's murder was given in the show, the episode [...] "packs [...] punch". Shearman and Pearson saw similarities between Doggett's trials and those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). They noted that while [...] "Mulder was always identified by his quest for his sister [...] ", Doggett [...] "carried {{the loss of his}} son as a private grief." [...] They concluded that this structuring made the entry [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] and [...] "moving". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, complimented the [...] "lyrical style" [...] of the episode, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot" [...] and [...] "well acted". Other reviews were not as glowing. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode made about as much sense as 'Underneath' or 'Jump the Shark'. It was entirely inappropriate for John Doggett’s struggle to end with someone else’s actions. If this is the way the series is going to end, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say, my hopes for a rousing finale are dwindling." ...|$|E
