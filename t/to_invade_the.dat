5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom of Jerusalem {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a center of her supporters.

Saladin decided <b>to</b> <b>invade</b> <b>the</b> crusader states in Syria. He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town.

The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E

Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne.

5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William <b>to</b> <b>invade.</b> <b>The</b> bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.|$|E
