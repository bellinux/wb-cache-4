The major products and services offered through the retail banking segment included individual and small business deposit accounts, mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business equipment financing, financial planning and investment services, online bill payment and Visa check and credit cards. [...] NetBank, through its Internet banking operations, operated as an FDIC-insured, federally chartered <b>thrift</b> <b>institution</b> serving approximately 286 thousand customers throughout the United States and in more than 90 foreign countries.

It did not maintain a branch network to support its banking business. The branchless model provided an opportunity to operate with less overhead expense than traditional branch banks. Customers initially relied on direct deposit and first class mail to make deposits into their accounts, supplemented later by QuickPost (free deposit drop-off at UPS Stores for overnight delivery to NetBank) and ATM deposits.|$|R
5000|$|A {{savings and}} loan {{association}} (S&L), or <b>thrift</b> <b>institution,</b> is a financial institution that specializes in accepting savings, deposits, and making mortgage and other loans. The terms [...] "S&L" [...] or [...] "thrift" [...] are mainly used in the United States; similar institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries include building societies and trustee savings banks. They are often mutually held (often called mutual savings banks), meaning that the depositors and borrowers are members with voting rights, and have the ability to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organization like the members of a credit union or the policyholders of a mutual insurance company. While it is possible for an S&L to be a joint-stock company, and even publicly traded; in such instances it is no longer truly a mutual association, and depositors and borrowers no longer have membership rights and managerial control. By law, thrifts can have no more than 20 percent of their lending in commercial loans — their focus on mortgage and consumer loans makes them particularly vulnerable to housing downturns such as the deep one the U.S. has experienced since 2007.|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis facing the United States {{savings and loan}} industry has been steadily escalating over the last decade. During this time, accounting treatments concerning various <b>thrift</b> <b>institution</b> transactions have also attracted a great deal of attention. The specialized accounting treatments used in the thrift industry, known as regulatory accounting practices (RAP) have been blamed as one of the culprits hindering the regulators' ability to detect serious financial problems within many institutions. Accordingly, RAP was phased out, and all federally insured savings and loan associations began preparing their financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as of January 1, 1989. The purpose of this dissertation is to compare the relative predictive values of the two historical cost based accounting conventions (RAP and GAAP) available to the savings and loar? industry during the 1980 's. For purposes of this dissertation, predictive value is defined as the usefulness in assessing future financial health and viability. The sample consisted of all the institutions reporting to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas between 1984 and 1989. Year-end thrift financial report data, obtained from Sheshunoff Information Services, Inc. (Austin, Texas) was used to calculate several financial ratios. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas provided a comprehensive listing of all institutions that failed between January 1, 1985 and March 31, 1989. The null hypothesis tested in this study was: no significant differences existed between the predictive values of RAP and GAAP financial statements. Using a dichotomous dependent variable (failed/not failed) and independent variables from prior research, several multinomial logistic models were developed to test the null hypothesis. All models developed failed to reject the null hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficiency}} and solvency of savings and loans <b>institutions</b> (<b>thrifts).</b> Thrifts that were inefficient (according to a nonparametric measure) were 4 1 / 2 {{times more likely than}} efficient thrifts to fail in the future. We also find that absent controls for lines of business pursued, stock institutions were both less efficient and more likely to fail than mutuals. With controls, these results are reversed. A consistent explanation is that stock institutions are better at resolving the standard agency conflict between owners and managers, but worse at resolving the "asset-substitution" conflict between shareholders and debtholders (depositors). Last, we find that some lines of business deregulated by the Garn-St. Germain Act adversely affected efficiency and solvency. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} and compare the impact of the flow of deposits on the balance sheets of the mutual savings banks (MSBs) and the savings and loan associations (SLAs) of New York State (NYSTATE). They were compared to each other for the years 1966 to 1980 with a 1981 update. The State was divided into two sections, NYCITY, basically the New York City SMSA plus Nassau and Suffolk counties and NYOTHER, the balance of the State. These were also compared to each other. ^ A substantial review of the literature investigated 5 major commissions and studies. Major industry problems were also examined. Finally the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 was examined and summarized. ^ It was hypothesized that the two subareas of each institution would have different reactions to the same influences, and also that the two thrifts would have different reactions. The statistical tool was a correlation coefficient analysis with 60 data points. ^ Chapter 3 analyzed the liability accounts. Chapter 4 analyzed asset account management, including a discussion of liquidity. Chapter 5 analyzed net worth as a proxy for profit. The balance sheet accounts were compared for relationships to the flow of deposits, the market place yields, and to each other. ^ The major findings for these chapters can be summarized as follows: (1) the MSBs and SLAs are not different in their reactions except in their asset management; (2) that the inflows have not 2 ̆ 2 suffered 2 ̆ 2 from high interest rates; (3) that mortgage loans were not terribly affected until 1980, only the rate of increase was affected; (4) there has been an increasing sensitivity of deposit flows to interest rates; (5) the liquidity ratios have improved, but the improvement is deceptive; (6) that regular passbook savings held up in NYOTHER until 1979. ^ The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that NYCITY will have different reactions than will NYOTHER to the same type of influences with each type of <b>thrift</b> <b>institution.</b> ^ The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that the two types of institution of NYSTATE will have different reactions to the same type of influences. ^ There is a major public policy issue pinpointed by this study. The thrifts have been historically viewed as separate and distinct institutions which react differently and which are viewed as different by the public. The evidence does not confirm this. The liability accounts did not support the hypotheses. Should the regulators, the legislatures, and the various banking authorities continue to view them as separate. This study suggests that they do not do so and regulate for them as if they are identical and equal. ...|$|R

40|$|Little {{empirical}} work {{exists on}} the substitutability of depository institutions. In particular, the willingness of consumers to substitute banks for thrifts and to switch between multimarket and single-market institutions (i. e., institutions with large vs. small branch networks) has been of strong interest to policymakers. We estimate a structural model of consumer choice of depository institutions using a panel data set that includes most depository institutions and market areas in the United States over the period 1990 - 2001. Using a flexible framework, we uncover utility parameters that affect a consumer's choice of institution and measure the degree of market segmentation for two institution subgroups. We use our estimates to calculate elasticities and perform policy experiments that measure the substitutability of firms within and across groupings. We find both dimensions [...] thrifts and banks, and single- and multimarket institutions [...] to be important market segments to consumer choice and, ultimately, to competition in both urban and rural markets.
