5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a {{decision}} was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{use for the}} Di 3 was {{to operate}} the three non-electrified long-distance lines of NSB: the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line. Following the {{delivery}} of the first batch in 1957, they were from 2 June used on the Dovre Line, north of Otta to Trondheim, and further north along the Nordland Line to Mo i Rana. <b>The</b> <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on the Nordland Line, and reduced travel time by one hour. From Hamar to Otta, the track did not have sufficient permitted axle load. From the second batch of eight units, five were put into service on the Bergen Line, the rest on the Dovre and Nordland Lines. Necessary upgrades of the permitted axle load {{had been made to}} the Dovre Line and Nordland Line, and the locomotives were in use from Hamar to Saltdal. On 30 November, the Nordland Line was completed to Fauske, and the full length operated with Di 3.|$|E

50|$|What {{makes this}} {{different}} from Calculation {{is how the}} cards in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>are</b> dealt.

Cards from <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>are</b> laid {{one at a time}} to the wastepile and can be placed on the foundations if possible and/or necessary. Only the top card of the wastepile is available for play and once <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> has run out, the cards on the wastepile are turned over and become <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b> This conversion from leftover cards on <b>the</b> wastepile to <b>stock</b> can <b>be</b> done twice in the game.|$|R

40|$|When {{weak and}} strong fish <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> caught in <b>the</b> same fishery, {{managing}} {{for the protection}} of <b>the</b> weak <b>stock</b> may result in foregone economic benefits from harvest of <b>the</b> strong <b>stock,</b> while managing for <b>the</b> strong <b>stock</b> may result in overfishing of <b>the</b> weak <b>stock.</b> A particular complication arises when <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> not easily distinguished in the catch, for example when <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>are</b> of <b>the</b> same or a similar species.

50|$|After use, if <b>the</b> master <b>stock</b> {{will not}} <b>be</b> {{immediately}} reused {{it is usually}} boiled, skimmed, strained and cooled quickly to kill any microorganisms in <b>the</b> <b>stock.</b> <b>The</b> growth of microbes in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> can potentially spoil the flavour of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> or pose a health risk. <b>The</b> <b>stock</b> <b>is</b> then refrigerated or frozen until required.

25|$|Director of {{photography}} was Ulf Brantås, who {{started his career}} as a cinematographer for Roy Andersson and had filmed both of Moodysson's previous feature films. Lilya 4-ever was shot with an Aaton XTR Prod on 16mm film which was later transferred to 35mm. Minimum lighting was used, mainly from practicals and whenever possible only sunlight. Locations were only sparsely rigged by the crew. A custom built rickshaw, made from the wheels of a mountain bike, was used for the long rearward-facing tracking shots.

25|$|On March 22, 1853, the Pouighkeepsie and Salt Point Plank Road Company {{was formed}} to {{construct}} a plank road {{from the town of}} Poughkeepsie to the hamlet of Salt Point. The new plank road company gave out it shares to their holders on March 8 of that year. However, nothing was constructed, and the company was in the New York State Supreme Court in 1861 suing over the ownership of stock in construction of the new roadway. When <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> sold, the agreement stated that the plank road would have the room to extend itself to Clinton Corners. One stockholder, known only as Griffin, wanted the route done on a certain alignment when constructed, but protested that it was contrived differently. The company asked for the shares back from Griffin, who would not give them back.|$|E

25|$|Each branch had {{an initial}} {{investment}} of $160,000, at first {{there were only}} ten branches and the total bank's value was $1.6 million. The start up money was all hard money in Spanish and Mexican silver dollars. The money was raised by issuing stock sold at $50 per share. Half of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> to be purchased {{by the state and}} the other half was sold to the public. By May 20, 1834, all the public stock for the new bank had been issued. The state allowed the public stock to be sold at $18.75 per share, with the other $31.25 being financed on the state's credit, until the purchaser could pay the full amount back to the state with 6% interest. On August 6, the state completed its purchase of 50% of the bank's stock. The money to purchase the stock came through the sale and mortgage of thousands of acres of public land. On November 19 Governor Noah Noble declared the bank open for business.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Patent {{made its}} {{move into the}} gaming {{industry}} in 1979, acquiring United Coin Machine Company, {{one of the largest}} slot route operators in Nevada, and announcing plans for the Colorado Belle hotel and casino in Laughlin, {{the first of a series}} of hotels to be built in the Las Vegas area. An obstacle arose in July 1980 in the form of an SEC investigation, alleging inadequate financial disclosure and sale of unregistered stock. Under scrutiny from the Nevada Gaming Commission, Solomon was forced to step down as chairman, as a condition of licensing for the casino. Three new directors were added in November to the company's board as part of a settlement under discussion with the SEC, but by March 1981, regulators still had questions about the company's public disclosure, and trading in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> suspended for 10 days. The SEC investigation ended in 1983 with no further action against the company, while Solomon personally agreed to an injunction against any further securities violations, rather than fighting charges that he illegally sold stock in the company between 1975 and 1980 to raise money for its gaming ventures.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the pier}} had a baggage line from 1863, {{though this was}} {{replaced}} in 1864 when the pier was widened to provide a steam-driven tramway capable of transporting passengers and their luggage. The line was re-laid in 1893, with electrification coming in April 1905. The rolling stock was rebuilt in 1936 when the line {{was taken over by}} Southport Corporation. The pier was closed during the Second World War and when it reopened the tram did not reopen with it, as the town had lost its supply of DC electricity. The tram line reopened in 1950, with the track gauge changed and moved {{to the side of the}} pier (previously central) and from 1954 operated with new diesel trains, known as the Silver Belle and built by local engineer Harry Barlow who owned the Lakeside Miniature Railway. <b>The</b> <b>stock</b> <b>was</b> replaced in 1973 with English Rose which operated until the mid-1990s, at which time there were doubts over the pier's future.
