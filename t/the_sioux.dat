5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the police were}} {{managing}} the Sitting Bull incident. In 1876 the United States military led a campaign against <b>the</b> <b>Sioux</b> in Dakota; the Sioux's leader, Sitting Bull, concluded that the conflict was unwinnable, and chose to seek sanctuary in Canada. Sitting Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Sioux,</b> in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part. <b>The</b> <b>Sioux</b> declined to return south, however, and the police had to deploy around 200 men to Fort Walsh to oversee the immigrant community. The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared {{some of their own}} supplies with <b>the</b> <b>Sioux,</b> who were not covered by Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of the newcomers to the United States, and Sitting Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low population, South Dakota {{does not}} host any major league {{professional}} sports franchises. The state has minor league and independent league teams, {{all of which}} play in Sioux Falls or Rapid City. Sioux Falls is home to four teams: <b>the</b> <b>Sioux</b> Falls Canaries (baseball), <b>the</b> <b>Sioux</b> Falls Skyforce (basketball), <b>the</b> <b>Sioux</b> Falls Stampede (hockey), and <b>the</b> <b>Sioux</b> Falls Storm (indoor American football). The Canaries play in the American Association, and their home field is Sioux Falls Stadium. The Skyforce play in the NBA G League, and are owned by the NBA's Miami Heat. They play at the Sanford Pentagon. The Stampede and Storm share the Denny Sanford Premier Center. The Stampede play in the USHL, and the Storm play in the CIF. Rapid City has a hockey team named the Rapid City Rush that plays in the ECHL. The Rush began their inaugural season in 2008 at the Rushmore Plaza Civic Center.|$|E
