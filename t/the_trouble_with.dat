In 2003, Cryer was cast as Alan Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009 and 2012.

The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E

These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.|$|E

25|$|Eventually <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> England {{escalated}} {{into the}} War of 1812.

Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with “old” one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of string theory from early on {{is that it is}} not manifestly {{background}} independent. In string theory, one must typically specify a fixed reference geometry for spacetime, and all other possible geometries are described as perturbations of this fixed one. In his book <b>The</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>With</b> Physics, physicist Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics claims that this is the principal weakness of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, saying that string theory has failed to incorporate this important insight from general relativity.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> our genial humorist {{is that he}} {{is beyond}} his depth. He would not make a success if he turned statesman.

25|$|Third {{generation}} sequencing {{technologies have}} demonstrated promising prospects {{in solving the}} problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation {{at the level of}} transcripts.

It is anticipated that Oxford Nanopore will put forth similar technologies. <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads.
