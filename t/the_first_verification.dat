50|$|Three {{successful}} telemetry {{sessions were}} conducted, gathering solar-wind and cosmic-ray data near Earth, at the Earth's magnetopause, and on February 19 {{at a distance}} of 1,900,000 km. After discovering the solar wind with Luna 2, Venera 1 provided <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>verification</b> that this plasma was uniformly present in deep space. Seven days later, the next scheduled telemetry session failed to occur. On May 19, 1961, Venera 1 passed within 100,000 km of Venus. With the help of the British radio telescope at Jodrell Bank, some weak signals from Venera 1 may have been detected in June. Soviet engineers believed that Venera-1 failed due to the overheating of a solar-direction sensor.|$|E

50|$|In March 2001, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>verification</b> of Bhutanese {{refugees}} {{eligible for}} repatriation commenced in Nepalese refugee camps. Actual repatriation was then estimated to occur within one year. However, progress stalled {{for over a}} decade. In 2003, a Bhutanese verification team was attacked and injured in Jhapa, resulting in further delay. As of 2011, over 200 refugees in the Khudunabari refugee camp alone had been certified. However, no Bhutanese refugees had been repatriated. In April 2011, Bhutan and Nepal again opened talks on repatriation, however the UNHCR remains committed to third country resettlement in light of Bhutan's refusal to guarantee full citizenship and other human rights for returnees. As of July 2011, the governments of Bhutan and Nepal had held at least 15 rounds of bilateral talks with no practical solution reached; although Bhutanese state media echoed Bhutan's insistence on continued talks with Nepal, it has signaled its preference for third country resettlement. Nepal, for its part, has not accepted the refugees into its own population.|$|E
5000|$|Much {{research}} in several science disciplines, including economics, political science, geology, paleontology, ecology, meteorology, and astronomy, relies on quasi-experiments. For example, in astronomy {{it is clearly}} impossible, when testing the hypothesis [...] "Stars are collapsed clouds of hydrogen", to {{start out with a}} giant cloud of hydrogen, and then perform the experiment of waiting a few billion years for it to form a star. However, by observing various clouds of hydrogen in various states of collapse, and other implications of the hypothesis (for example, the presence of various spectral emissions from the light of stars), we can collect data we require to support the hypothesis. An early example of this type of experiment was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>verification</b> in the 17th century that light does not travel from place to place instantaneously, but instead has a measurable speed. Observation of the appearance of the moons of Jupiter were slightly delayed when Jupiter was farther from Earth, as opposed to when Jupiter was closer to Earth; and this phenomenon was used to demonstrate that the difference in the time of appearance of the moons was consistent with a measurable speed.|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and magnitude of}} localization errors detected by verification films, during mantle-field irradiation for Hodgkin's disease, were assessed. A total of 216 treatment set-ups was studied. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>verification</b> film, {{at the start of}} treatment, showed a localization error of over 1 cm in 13 % of cases, leading to a critical margin between the shielding block and the tumor bearing area in 9 % of the treatment set-ups. After the first correction, an adequate treatment set-up was obtained in 60 % of cases, whereas after two corrections the adequacy rate was 84 %. Verification films are therefore very useful in detecting clinically important localization errors and in monitoring and checking subsequent corrections.
