50|$|In patent, {{industrial}} design rights and trademark laws, a priority right or {{right of priority}} is a time-limited right, triggered by <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>filing</b> of an application for a patent, an {{industrial design}} or a trademark respectively. The priority right allows the claimant to file a subsequent application in another country for the same invention, design, or trademark effective as of the date of filing the first application. When filing the subsequent application, the applicant must claim the priority of the first application {{in order to make}} use of the right of priority. The right of priority belongs to the applicant or his successor in title.|$|E

50|$|Due to delays to the {{tribunal}} hearings the claims were not resolved for 30 months after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>filing</b> in 1995. During this time Blencoe {{was subjected to}} vast media coverage {{that led to the}} end of his political career, and contributed to his and his family's social and psychological hardship. The Supreme Court of Canada rejected Blencoe's argument that the delay warranted a stay of the human rights complaint. Following this decision, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal issued its decision on the original sexual harassment complaint. The Tribunal found that Mr. Blencoe had engaged in conduct towards an employee which was sexual in nature and unwelcome, and that this conduct had a negative work-related impact on the employee. The Tribunal issued a declaration that Mr. Blencoe not engage in similar activity in the future an ordered that he pay $5000 to the former employee.|$|E
5000|$|Mahlon Gore (February 4, 1837 - June 27, 1916) was an American politician, who was {{the thirteenth}} Mayor of Orlando from 1893 to 1896. Gore was born in Michigan and left home {{at the age of}} 15 to start work as a printer. He enlisted in the Second Michigan {{infantry}} in 1861, and after completing his three months of service decided not to re-enlist and moved to Iowa with his first wife, Josephine. They later homesteaded in the Dakota Territory, where Gore is believed to have made <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>filing</b> in Dakota Territory under the new Homestead Act on January 1, 1863. By 1880, his health was failing and so he moved to Orlando, Florida. After Gore moved to Orlando he purchased the Orange County Reporter and entered the newspaper business. He was later elected to the Orlando City Council, and served as Mayor of Orlando from 1894 to 1896. In 1912, he helped to found the First Unitarian Church of Orlando along with his second wife, Caroline. Gore died on June 27, 1916, aged 79. [...] He was interred at Greenwood Cemetery.|$|E

50|$|The UPOV Convention also {{establishes}} a multilateral system of national treatment, under which citizens of any member state {{are treated as}} citizens of all member states {{for the purpose of}} obtaining plant breeders rights. It also sets up a multilateral priority filing system, under which an application for protection filed in one member state {{establishes a}} filing date for applications filed in all other member states within one year of that original filing date. This allows a breeder to file in any one member country within the one-year period required to preserve the novelty of their variety, and the novelty of the variety will still be recognized when the filing is done in other member countries within one year of the original filing date. However, if the applicant does not wish to make use of priority filing, he or she has four years in which to apply in all other member states, excepting the USA, for all species except tree and vine species in which case he or she has six years to make application. More information can be obtained in Article 10 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2100/94 of 27 July 2004. The trigger to start the four- or six-year period is not actually the date on which <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>filing</b> is made but the date on which the variety was first commercialised.|$|E
5000|$|Louisa {{loved to}} sew and often sewed her husband's and children's clothes; {{this was a}} result of her {{training}} in a convent as a young girl. Noted as always being practical, Louisa is noted by Lottie Kocken (a girl who was part of the Buffalo Bill Excursion in 1878) as being upset when Cody would send her a large bouquet of flowers because [...] "she needed the money more than flowers." [...] Jessie Blackenburg Renyolds also remembered Louisa, commenting that [...] "Willie just couldn't hold onto money, for he was a grand spender, and she has to fix it so he couldn't mortgage everything." [...] When Kit Carson died in 1868, that was believed to have been the final straw for Cody, who was wanting to spend his money and gain the affections of any woman but his wife. Cody filed two divorce petitions, with one newspaper claiming that the cause behind them was Louisa's [...] "nagging." [...] <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>filing</b> of divorce was withdrawn due to the death of Orra Cody in 1883. The second went to trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1905, flooding headlines and tearing communities into the crossfire and demanding they pick sides.While the divorce scandal raged on between the two in the courtroom and in the papers, Louisa continued to maintain the house and her living children. When asked to put the suit on hold temporarily in order to attend the funeral of Arta, Louisa refused, demanding that she remain married and the suit be dropped. On March 23, 1905, the district court of Sheridan did not grant Cody his divorce. Louisa then paid her real estate taxes in Lincoln County, Missouri on 1,200 acres of land and numerous houses assessed under her name and on 700 acres that had been in Cody's name; the result was more than $600, making her one of the largest tax payers in the county. Louisa and Cody reconciled in 1910 and she often attended his Wild West Shows until his death in 1917. Louisa died in 1921.|$|E
40|$|As {{global trade}} and {{business}} activities intensified, cross-national patenting activities {{have been playing}} an increasingly {{important role in the}} process of innovation accumulation and growth. However, few studies (to my knowledge) have examined the characteristics of cross-national patents and their relationship to the accumulation and growth of innovation, especially {{in the context of a}} developing versus a developed country.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes to}} broaden {{by more than}} 10 %-compared with the current practice-the set of {{applications}} for priority patents, {{which is used to}} compute worldwide patent indicators. This extension is made possible thanks to the inclusion in the corpus of documents used for the calculation of indicators of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>filing</b> patent applications that are designated as " artificial priority patents " in the PATSTAT database and currently discarded for the production of indicators. This research aims to show how adding these " artificial " patent applications can modify the value of the worldwide patent indicators. Artificial patent applications have never been used before because they contain very scarce information in their original state. We present a methodology we have developed to, first, replenish the artificial patents with information retrieved from close patents belonging to the same INPADOC family. Then, we study in details a range of indicators characterising the trends in the internationalisation of corporate R&D inventive activities. We provide evidence that the internationalisation pattern can be modified when including replenished artificial corporate patents in the indicator calculation. At the world level, incorporating artificial priority patents does not affect the trends over time, nor introduce any significant changes in the values of the indicators. However, analyses performed at a smaller scale, such as the firms' continent level or the firms' sector, show significant changes of the level of the intercontinental internationalisation in particular for the US firms...|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} {{arrangements}} of n non-attacking rooks symmetric {{to one of}} the diagonals (for determinacy, the diagonal corresponding to a1–h8 on the chessboard) on a n'n board is given by the telephone numbers defined by the recurrence Qn = Q'n−1 + (n−1)Qn−2. This recurrence is derived in the following way. Note that the rook on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>file</b> either stands on the bottom corner square or it stands on another square. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> case, removal of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>file</b> and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> rank leads to the symmetric arrangement n−1 rooks on a (n−1)(n−1) board. The number of such arrangements is Qn−1. In the second case, for the original rook there is another rook, symmetric to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> one about <b>the</b> chosen diagonal. Removing the files and ranks of those rooks leads to a symmetric arrangement n−2 rooks on a (n−2)(n−2) board. Since the number of such arrangements is Qn−2 and the rook can be put on the n−1 square of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>file,</b> there are (n−1)Qn−2 ways for doing this, which immediately gives the above recurrence.
