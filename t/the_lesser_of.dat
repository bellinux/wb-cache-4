5|$|The British did {{not want}} their colony to become an American possession, and the Canadian government, despite being {{convinced}} that absorbing Newfoundland would not benefit Canada economically, thought that the annexation would be <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two evils {{when compared to the}} prospect of the country being almost completely surrounded by American territory.|$|E
5|$|On November24, 2004, the {{day before}} Thanksgiving, 2,000 Teamsters Union {{employees}} went on strike, after contract negotiations failed. This was the first strike {{in the history of}} the roadway. As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the United States, to avoid traffic jams, tolls were waived for the rest of the day. Starting on November25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November30. Normal toll collection resumed December1.|$|E
5|$|Smith invented Sartorias-deles as {{a fantasy}} world that {{gradually}} became populated by humans {{over a number}} of centuries; these new arrivals were influenced by the world's indigenous beings enough to better themselves, largely eradicating societal problems like disease and overpopulation. She originally wrote Crown Duel as a twenty-year-old, and when she returned to rewrite the story later in life, she sought to maintain the story from Mel's young perspective. As a result, the novel's intended audience are young adults. As Smith's most popular YA novel, both parts of Crown Duel received generally positive reviews. Reviews of the 1997 publication of Crown Duel highlight the character of Mel and Smith's worldbuilding as positive elements. Critics assessed Court Duel as generally <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the two.|$|E
50|$|The {{book was}} written before <b>The</b> <b>Lesser</b> Key <b>of</b> Solomon, and has some differences. There are sixty-nine demons listed (instead of seventy-two), {{and the order}} of the spirits varies, {{as well as some of}} their characteristics. The demons Vassago, Seere, Dantalion and Andromalius are not listed in this book, while Pruflas is not listed in <b>The</b> <b>Lesser</b> Key <b>of</b> Solomon. Pseudomonarchia Daemonum does not {{attribute}} seals to the demons, as <b>The</b> <b>Lesser</b> Key <b>of</b> Solomon does.|$|R

25|$|When Livni {{was tapped}} {{to form the}} next {{governing}} coalition, Palestinian political analyst Mahdi Abdel Hadi said that Livni had been received warmly in the Gulf, {{and that she was}} the leader most Arabs want to see as Israel's next prime minister.

25|$|For a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite {{supported}} the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, {{the massacre of}} Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two or more evils. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, Rómulo Betancourt, a fierce critic of Trujillo.|$|E
25|$|Also {{transferring}} to the VFA for the 1940 season was Collingwood full-forward Ron Todd, {{who moved to}} Williamstown. With former South Melbourne teammate Laurie Nash at VFA club Camberwell (and still considered amongst the best footballers in the country), and the interest generated by the VFA having legalized throwing the ball in 1938, there was talk that the VFA, traditionally <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the two leagues, would now match the VFL for crowds.|$|E
25|$|The {{constituency}} {{is named}} after the River Itchen, which flows through it and is <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the two major rivers that reach the tidal estuary of Southampton Water at the city. Although until the 1970s it was a safe Labour seat, it elected a Conservative MP, Christopher Chope in 1983 and 1987 after the sitting MP Bob Mitchell left Labour in 1981 for the SDP. The combination of Mitchell as a strong SDP-Liberal Alliance candidate in both 1983 and 1987, together with Conservative landslides, made Southampton Itchen highly competitive.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Pramoedya (like many Indonesian Nationalists, Sukarno and Suharto among them) {{at first}} {{supported}} the occupying forces of Imperial Japan. He believed the Japanese to be <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two evils, {{compared to the}} Dutch. He worked as a typist for a Japanese newspaper in Jakarta. As the war went on, however, Indonesians were dismayed by the austerity of wartime rationing and by increasingly harsh measures taken by the Japanese military. The Nationalist forces loyal to Sukarno switched their support to the incoming Allies against Japan; all indications are that Pramoedya did as well.|$|E
25|$|Teams {{above the}} cap (or teams below the cap but {{would end up}} more than $100,000 over the cap {{following}} a trade) cannot acquire more than 125% plus $100,000 of the salary they trade away.

There is no lower limit—teams may divest themselves of as much salary as they wish (or can convince another team to take on) in a trade.|$|E
25|$|Emley added {{floodlights}} {{to their}} facilities in 1981, when these were quite rare for non-league clubs at that level. This paid off when floodlights became compulsory for {{clubs in the}} Northern Counties East League Premier Division. They initially finished around mid-table. Michael Pamment, who scored a record 305 goals for the club, took over as manager in 1978, and served until 1985. Under his reign Emley finished in third place and a later a runners up spot in 1985–86. At this time Emley entered the FA Vase rather than the trophy. This is <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the two non-league cup competitions, but gave Emley {{a better chance of}} success.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{understood}} that the region would not be re-attached. Therefore, they favored <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two evils and tacitly supported the interests of Lithuania. The Weimar Republic saw both Poland and France as its major enemies while Lithuania was more neutral. Also, once Germany restored its might, {{it would be much}} easier to recapture the region from weaker Lithuania than from larger Poland. Already on February 22, 1922, the Germans unofficially informed the Lithuanians that they were not opposed to Lithuanian action in Klaipėda and that, understandably, such a stance would never be officially declared. Such attitudes were later confirmed in other unofficial German–Lithuanian communications and even during the revolt, when Berlin urged local Germans not to hinder the Lithuanian plans.|$|E
25|$|After the {{oil shock}} the NUM renewed its claim for a {{substantial}} wage increase, a claim which broke government pay guidelines, and then began industrial action {{in the form of}} an overtime ban in support of the claim. The sudden shortage of coal in the middle of the winter forced the Government to announce a 'three-day week' of restrictions of electricity by industry. Adamson deplored the move but regarded it as <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two evils because industry might not be able to operate at all. Adamson supported the Government's refusal to concede the miners' pay claim because of concerns that other wage claims would follow, although he conceded that it could be supported if there was a watertight guarantee that other unions would settle within the limits.|$|E
25|$|Rank {{and status}} are fixed from birth. There {{is no way}} in Tongan society to climb up in rank. A low ranking chief will always remain <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> a high ranking chief, even though his lands may be bigger and richer and so forth. But he can try to marry a high ranking woman, for {{instance}} if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed too, can have some vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.|$|E

25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two evils when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E
