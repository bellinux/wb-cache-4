25|$|Improvisational Music Therapy (IMT), is {{increasing}} in popularity as a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>technique</b> being applied {{to children with}} ASD. The process of IMT occurs when the client and therapist make up music, {{through the use of}} various instruments, song and movement. The specific needs of each child or client need to be taken into consideration. Some children with ASD find their different environments chaotic and confusing, therefore, IMT sessions require the presence of a certain routine and be predictable in nature, within their interactions and surroundings. Music can provide all of this, it can be very predicable, it is highly repetitious with its melodies and sounds, but easily varied with phrasing, rhythm and dynamics giving it a controlled flexibility. The allowance of parents or caregivers to sessions can put the child at ease and allow for activities to be incorporated into everyday life.|$|E

2500|$|Sapir/Whorf {{contemporary}} Alfred Korzybski was independently developing {{his theory}} of general semantics, which was aimed at using language's influence on thinking to maximize human cognitive abilities. Korzybski's thinking was influenced by logical philosophy such as Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica and Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Although Korzybski {{was not aware of}} Sapir and Whorf's writings, the movement was followed by Whorf-admirer Stuart Chase, who fused Whorf's interest in cultural-linguistic variation with Korzybski's programme in his popular work [...] "The Tyranny of Words". S. I. Hayakawa was a follower and popularizer of Korzybski's work, writing Language in Thought and Action. The general semantics movement influenced the development of neurolinguistic programming, another <b>therapeutic</b> <b>technique</b> that seeks to use awareness of language use to influence cognitive patterns.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This study {{examines}} the relative efficacies {{of the specific}} and non-specific factors in psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is conceptualized as having three common components: the problem component whose essence is low self-esteem; the interactional component which induces change through social influence; and the treatment component which elicits change through <b>therapeutic</b> <b>techniques.</b> The relative efficacy {{of each of these}} two change components - influence (nonspecific factor) and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>techniques</b> (specific factor) - is the central issue of the study. Four groups, each of 20 subjects, were matched according to their low levels of self-esteem. Each group was administered a different treatment in three, one-hour sessions over a period of two weeks, designed to enhance self-esteem. The four treatments involved: 1. An emphasis on techniques - cognitive behavior - with social influence minimized through pre-session inductions; 2. An emphasis on social influence with no "usual" <b>therapeutic</b> <b>techniques</b> other than talk; 3. An emphasis on both <b>therapeutic</b> <b>techniques</b> - cognitive- behavior and social influence maximized through pre-session inductions; and 4. A no-treatment control group. Social influence induction scales indicated that pre-session inductions successfully maximized and minimized conditions of influence. Post-treatment interview measures indicated that the "full-therapy" - with both techniques and influence maximized -was most effective. However, the therapies with maximized social influence obtained significantly h 1 gher degrees of acceptance of their therapy, and elicited significantly greater enhancement of self-esteem, than did either the maximized technique, minimized influence therapy, or the no-treatment, control group. The therapy with minimized social influence showed no significant difference in its levels of acceptance, or in its enhancement of self-esteem, from the control group. These findings are interpreted to support the interactional view of psychotherapy; seeing therapeutic change as an influence process, and the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>techniques</b> as a means of further maximizing that influence. A case is made for a re-emphasis in psychotherapy on the interactional dynamics from a social psychological viewpoint...|$|R
