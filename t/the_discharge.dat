40|$|<b>The</b> <b>discharging</b> {{electrode}} for an {{electrostatic precipitator}} is vibrated by various forces. They are the external {{force and the}} internal forces. The former {{is due to the}} shock with hammer-blowing to remove the adhering dust on <b>the</b> <b>discharging</b> electrode, and <b>the</b> latter the action of gas flow or the electrical forces. The spark over which causes by the large vibration of <b>the</b> <b>discharging</b> electrode decreases <b>the</b> collection efficiency of the electrical precipitator, and so it is desirable to prevent the vibratian of <b>the</b> <b>discharging</b> electrode. <b>The</b> vibration of <b>the</b> <b>discharging</b> electrode for <b>the</b> cylindertype electrostatic precipitator (dia. 10. 5 cm, length 200 cm) was tested in atmospheric air. The vibrational characteristics and the brief analysis of the electrical forces which act on <b>the</b> <b>discharging</b> electrode were considered.

5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> does not always magnetise in the same direction.

The excitability of the fibers of the nerve trunk appears to vary synchronously, so that nerve impulses initiated in fibers from tactile receptors not contributing to <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>discharge</b> can be conducted only during the part of the cycle occupied by <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>discharge...</b>|$|R

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that auxiliaries received the substantial cash bonuses (donativum) handed to legionaries on the accession of a new emperor and other occasions. Although irregular, these payments (each worth 75 denarii to a common legionary) averaged once every 7.5 years in the early 1st century and every three years later. Duncan-Jones has suggested that donativa may have been paid to auxiliaries also from the time of Hadrian onwards, {{on the grounds that the}} total amount of donative to the military increased sharply at that time. A very valuable benefit paid to legionaries was <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> bonus (praemia) paid on completion of the full 25 years' service. At 3,000 denarii, this was equivalent to ten years' gross salary for a common legionary after the pay increase of 84AD. It would enable him to purchase a substantial plot of land. Again, there is no indication that auxiliaries were paid a discharge bonus. For auxiliaries, <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> bonus was the grant of Roman citizenship, which carried important tax exemptions. However, Duncan-Jones argues that the fact that service in the auxilia was competitive with the legions (deduced from the many Roman citizens that joined the auxilia) that a discharge bonus may have been paid.|$|E

5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> terminates.|$|E
5|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal discharge {{generated by}} the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere. The dielectric barrier discharge {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine. The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jets. These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as plasma bullets.|$|E
