It housed the forward system's Mark 8 Rangekeeper, Mark 41 Stable Vertical, Mk13 FC Radar controls and displays, Parallax Correctors, Fire Control Switchboard, battle <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard,</b> battery status indicators, assistant Gunnery Officers, and Fire Control Technicians (FTs).|$|E
5|$|While raiding her {{apartment}} after the bank robbery, police found evidence tying Power to both robberies. This included weapons, ammunition and a <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> from the armory. Power's attorneys would subsequently blame her {{involvement in the}} robberies {{as the result of}} manipulation by her partner Bond.|$|E
5|$|The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the Führerbunker {{was below}} the water table, {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A diesel generator provided electricity, and well water was pumped {{in as the}} water supply. Communications systems included a telex, a <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard,</b> and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated {{at the end of}} the war, Hitler received much of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz bombing {{campaign}} against Britain, {{it was decided}} to increase the protection of the Cabinet War Rooms by the installation of a massive layer of concrete known as 'the Slab'. Up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick, the Slab was progressively extended and by spring 1941 the increased protection had enabled the Cabinet War Rooms to expand to three times their original size. While the usage of many of the War Rooms' individual rooms changed {{over the course of the}} war, the facility included dormitories for staff, private bedrooms for military officers and senior ministers, and rooms for typists or <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> operators.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Yohannes IV School {{was one of}} 9 provincial {{secondary}} schools in Ethiopia (excluding Eritrea). That same year a 100-number <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> was installed at Mek'ele. The next year, Mek'ele was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as a First Class Township.|$|E

25|$|The {{automatic}} <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> {{was introduced}} in 1892 along with dial telephones. By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic. Automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and electro-mechanical switches, which consumed {{a large amount of}} electricity. Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting Bell Labs to begin research on the transistor.|$|E
25|$|Hawking {{attended}} Radlett School, {{an independent}} {{school in the}} village of Radlett in Hertfordshire, for a year, and from September 1952, St Albans School, an independent school in the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire. The family placed a high value on education. Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill {{on the day of the}} scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception. From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> and other recycled components.|$|E
500|$|There {{was little}} {{manufacturing}} in Dallas. The city began to light its streets with gas lamps in 1874 [...] {{and began to}} brick over dirt lanes. In 1880, the first <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> came to Dallas, linking the water company and the fire station. In 1885, the Main Street was lit with electricity. In 1888, the Dallas Zoo opened as the first zoo in the state. In 1890, Dallas annexed the geographically-larger city of East Dallas, making it the most populous city in Texas.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, {{companies}} used manual <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboards,</b> and switchboard operators connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate jacks.|$|R
50|$|Small {{spark gaps}} are {{very common in}} <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboards,</b> as the long phone cables are very {{susceptible}} to induced surges from lightning strikes. Larger spark gaps are used to protect power lines.|$|R

500|$|On January 1, 1935, {{photographer}} Peter Stackpole's {{images of}} Wyntoon {{were published in}} Life magazine, showing Hearst relaxing at Wyntoon with friends. Hearst's communications office at Wyntoon was shown in the photos; it was built next to Bear House to keep him abreast of current events. This office was fitted into a shingle-covered bungalow built to house Joe Willicombe, Hearst's private secretary. The structure served as the [...] "nerve center" [...] of Hearst's publishing empire, with three round-the-clock operators minding the telegraph facilities and the <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hitler's {{accommodations}} {{were in this}} newer, lower section, and by February 1945 it {{had been}} decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings. After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the steel door, {{there was a long}} corridor with a series of rooms on each side. On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard.</b> On the left side was Eva Braun's bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler's private guest room), an ante-chamber (also known as Hitler's sitting room), which led into Hitler's study/office. On the wall hung a large portrait of Frederick the Great, [...] one of Hitler's heroes. A door led into Hitler's modestly furnished bedroom. Next to it was the conference/map room (also known as the briefing/situation room) which had a door that led out into the waiting room/ante-room.|$|E
500|$|In 1930 the Meteorological Office {{no longer}} used the Cooke telescope, {{and agreed to}} donate it to the {{university}} if they would handle its removal. Both the telescope and the observatory dome were moved to the observatory building. The telescope moved once again in 1952 to the David Dunlap Observatory north of the city, and in 1984 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum. The Department of Surveying and Geodesy used the observatory until the 1950s. Since then the office areas {{have been used for}} a variety of purposes, including a police substation and a <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard.</b> Renamed as the Louis Beaufort Stewart Observatory, the building was handed over to the Students' Administrative Council (now University of Toronto Students' Union) in 1953, which has used the building since then. [...] The dome, now unused, receives a yearly multi-colour paint job by engineering students.|$|E

50|$|The {{throughput}} of ports {{increased by}} 138 million tons and 12 new airports were built. 100,000 kilometers of long-distance trunk cable were finished, {{and the number}} of <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboards</b> increased to 58.95 million sets. Total installed generation capacity was increased to 75 million kilowatts, and annual electricity supply grew by 9%.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1870s, the Bell {{interests}} started utilizing their patent with a rental scheme, {{in which they}} would rent their instruments to individual users who would contract with other suppliers to connect them; for example from home to office to factory. [...] Western Union and the Bell company both soon realized that a subscription service would be more profitable, with the invention of the <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> or central office. Such an office was staffed by an operator who connected the calls by personal names. Some have argued that use of the telephone altered the physical layout of American cities.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his tenure}} on the War Labor Board, Feinsinger helped settle {{a number of}} {{important}} strikes. [...] In November 1944, he settled a national strike by <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard</b> operators belonging to the National Federation of Telephone Workers which had shut down telephone service in Washington, D.C., Detroit and other large cities. Feinsinger told the union leaders that they were defying the government of the United States and [...] "no union has done that yet and succeeded." [...] On November 24, telephone workers in Dayton ended their walk-out and the nationwide strike collapsed. President Roosevelt specifically praised Feinsinger for his role in ending the dispute.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1967, {{shortly after}} Epstein's death, Lennon asked Alistair Taylor {{to work as}} General Manager for Apple. It was during this period that Taylor {{appeared}} in the famous advertisement to promote Apple asking for new artists. Designed by McCartney, it showed him disguised as a one-man band, claiming: [...] "This man has talent..." [...] The publication in the New Musical Express and Rolling Stone brought an avalanche of applicants. The mail room, <b>telephone</b> <b>switchboard,</b> and conference rooms became jammed at all hours with [...] "artists" [...] begging the Beatles to give them money. George Harrison would later lament that [...] "We had every freak in the world coming in there". Many of these supplicants received the investments they sought and were never heard from again.|$|E
