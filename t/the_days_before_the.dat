5|$|According to Kotaku, a remastered {{version of}} Day of the Tentacle {{was in the}} works at LucasArts Singapore before the sale of LucasArts to Disney in 2012.

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> storm's {{arrival in}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued 40tropical cyclone-related advisories. Extensive {{preparations}} {{that resulted in}} a low loss of life and property were attributed to the warnings. In southern Florida, residents boarded up homes and businesses, and sought shelter in large structures. Hurricane parties took place in bars and hotel rooms, while some residents sat in hotel lobbies, listening to radio broadcasts. In Miami, stores sold out of various essentials—including bread and butter—as people prepared for the storm.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route {{used a variety of}} road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, a {{grand jury}} was {{assembled}} in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington; the trial was scheduled for May 15. The Times-Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington's fate. Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers. His lawyers prepared no defense, and noted that he appeared placid in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> trial.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ACC championship, Choice was named to the second-team All-ACC team, and was considered to be a threat on offense against Wake Forest.|$|E

5|$|The Netzarim junction, {{where the}} {{shooting}} took place, is {{known locally as}} the al-Shohada (martyrs') junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of Gaza City. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> shooting.|$|E

5|$|As plans {{moved forward}} the {{decision}} was made not just to play the game but make it an event celebrating New York hockey history. For the game the Crunch played their intrastate rivals the Binghamton Senators. <b>The</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> game local youth hockey teams played on the ice, and then the day after there was a pond hockey tournament played on the rink featuring 16 local teams. The fairgrounds also featured VIP tents, fan zones, bands, and ice sculpting for the celebration, as well as appearances by former players for New York's various professional teams.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the special session, {{it became clear that}} a major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.|$|E
5|$|On the day decreed, Le Gris and Carrouges {{travelled}} through Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in the city's Northern suburbs. The abbey's field {{had been}} converted from a jousting ground to a wooden arena especially for the combat, surrounded by banks for the spectators and a royal box. Attending the duel {{was not only the}} King and his uncles John, Duke of Berry, Philip the Bold and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother the Duke of Orléans, but thousands of ordinary Parisians, Normans and visiting French. Thousands of people had flooded into the city in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> combat to see the spectacle but all had been warned not to physically aid the combatants on pain of death, nor call out during the fight on pain of losing a hand.|$|E
5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.|$|E

According to legend, Termina was split into four areas by four magical giants that live in four regions of the land. At the center of Termina lies Clock Town, which features a large clock tower that counts down <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Carnival of Time—a major festival where the people of Termina pray for good luck and harvests.

5|$|Though the {{expedition}} ended in failure {{the members of}} the Uitvoerend Bewind became very nervous in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Bergen. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, Van der Goes who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France Zeeland. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French Directoire. At this time Napoleon Bonaparte performed his coup of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.|$|E
5|$|Wake Forest, {{which had}} begun the season with Benjamin Mauk as its {{starting}} quarterback, ended the season with redshirt freshman Riley Skinner filling the position. Despite having almost no experience starting at quarterback before the season, Skinner was named the ACC's rookie of the year. Skinner led the ACC in completion percentage, passing efficiency, and interception rate. In addition, Skinner set 10 new single-season passing records at Wake Forest during the 2006 season. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ACC Championship Game, Skinner {{was named to the}} second-team All-ACC team, joining eight other teammates selected to one of the two All-ACC teams.|$|E
