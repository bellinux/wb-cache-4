The physical simulator is a modified automobile cab instrumented to provide driver activity information and in-vehicle warnings that accurately reflect the performance of proposed sensors during defined scenarios. The simulation computing architecture uses a distributed multi-CPU environment to support six out-the-window displays, a head-up and a head-down display, six channels of audio output, and software to control the simulation and produce warnings. Planned evaluation with a population of subjects in a variety of scenarios will determine the best <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for use in prototype vehicles.

40|$|The {{collision}} <b>avoidance</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> is {{an emerging}} technology designed to assist drivers in avoiding red-light running (RLR) collisions at intersections. The {{aim of this}} paper is to evaluate the effect of auditory warning information on collision avoidance behaviors in the RLR pre-crash scenarios and further to examine the casual relationships among the relevant factors. A driving-simulator-based experiment was designed and conducted with 50 participants. The data from the experiments were analyzed by approaches of ANOVA and structural equation modeling (SEM). The collisions avoidance related variables were measured in terms of brake reaction time (BRT), maximum deceleration and lane deviation in this study. It was found that the collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> can result in smaller collision rates compared to the without-warning condition and lead to shorter reaction times, larger maximum deceleration and less lane deviation. Furthermore, the SEM analysis illustrate that the audio warning information in fact has both direct and indirect effect on occurrence of collisions, and the indirect effect plays a more important role on collision avoidance than the direct effect. Essentially, the auditory warning information can assist drivers in detecting the RLR vehicles in a timely manner, thus providing drivers more adequate time and space to decelerate to avoid collisions with the conflicting vehicles...|$|R

This information {{is used to}} enable collision <b>avoidance</b> and <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> One of the main challenges of the eventual large scale deployment of such systems is network congestion, which could critically degrade {{the quality of a}} CVS system. In this paper, we present a method for congestion monitoring and control based on limited feedback from the network. We study the relationship between channel occupancy, as a readily available feedback measure, controllable network parameters, and network performance. We describe a performance measure relevant to CVS systems and present a congestion control method, based on channel occupancy measurements, that robustly maintains the system performance near optimal operation points. We examine the convergence properties of the congestion control algorithm and provide guidelines for the design of such systems based on network and traffic density conditions.
