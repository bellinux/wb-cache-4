After the Grace children ignore Thimbletack's warning to destroy the Guide, Simon is abducted {{by a group of}} invisible goblins who live in the woods surrounding the house. Thimbletack leads Jared and Mallory to the old carriage house where they find a [...] "seeing stone" [...] (a stone with a natural hole in it) which gives the wearer, in this case Jared, the ability to see faeries (called the Sight). After Jared and Mallory narrowly avoid being captured by the goblins, they go searching for Simon in the woods. On their way through the forest, they encounter a troll residing in the river by a decrepit stone bridge. Partially protected by the daylight, they are able to avoid it, but lose their fencing weapons. After encountering a wounded griffin, they find the goblin camp and a plethora of prisoners hanging in cages made from refuse from the trees. While trying to rescue Simon, they meet a prisoner named Hogsqueal, a hobgoblin, who convinces them to help him escape in exchange for his help in rescuing Simon. Hogsqueal offers to spit in their eyes, which gives them the Sight without using the stone. Hogsqueal distracts the goblins from the children's escape and in return, Jared, Simon, and Mallory attract the goblins' attention away from Hogsqueal and then flee, leading the goblins back to the troll. [...] Jared convinces the <b>troll</b> <b>to</b> let them escape in return for leading the goblins to him to eat.
