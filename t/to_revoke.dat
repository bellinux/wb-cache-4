5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> television licences, purported <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-213 or Louis Riel Day Act and Bill C-417 Louis Riel Act are {{the more}} notable acts which have gone through parliament. Bill C-297 <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the {{conviction}} of Louis Riel {{was introduced to the}} House of Commons 21 October and 22 November 1996, however the motion lacked unanimous consent from the House and was dropped. Bill C-213 or the Louis Riel Day Act of 1997 attempted <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the conviction of Louis Riel for high treason and establish a National Day in his honour on 16 November. Bill C-417 or the Louis Riel Act which also had a first reading in parliament <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the conviction of Louis Riel, and establish 15 July as Louis Riel Day was tabled.|$|E

In 1957 the United States government threatened to deny visas to athletes from Communist countries.

5|$|As of October2014, Caltrans had {{considered}} relinquishing {{the eastern part}} of SR54 from the SR94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego. Two years later, the CTC approved a Caltrans proposal <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the proposed freeway status of the unconstructed portion of SR54 since the existing roads including Jamacha Boulevard would be able to handle the projected traffic load; this would allow the unused land to be sold.|$|E

30|$|For this purpose, [16] {{discusses}} potential {{use of a}} PKC scheme {{between the}} ADMF and the ICEs (as the points of interception), the SMLC, and the NFV-MANO entities. However, LI and LALS can include broad set of services and might be invoked {{for a longer period}} of time during which the target identity may start using services from NFVs residing out of the authorized jurisdiction. In this case, the LI and LALS certificates need <b>to</b> be <b>revoked</b> (other alternative is to use shorter expiration times for each certificate but that might result in a PKC management burden). This mechanism has a potential impact on real-time investigations in that critical IRI records or CC data might not be collected while the user and signaling traffic transits through the VNFs due <b>to</b> <b>revoked</b> or expired certificates.|$|R
5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to {{establish}} {{peace in the}} Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> all letters of marque and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it probable {{that one of the}} Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement.|$|E
5|$|Other federal {{government}} agencies also worked to undermine organizations, {{such as the}} CPUSA, they considered subversive: The Internal Revenue Service investigated 81organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> their tax exempt status; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining federal housing benefits; and {{attempts were made to}} deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|The Czech {{government}} {{had made a}} decision to introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014, planning to have the system working within two years. As police are obliged <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> a gun license when the licensee has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in a period of three years, the central registry of misdemeanors might have allowed police to effectively revoke the license long before the murders.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the country's most favored nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, arguing that it would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan came to Washington {{during the summer of}} 1962 to lobby against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, {{expansion}} of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, {{and development of}} Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan {{was approved by the}} government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Mugabe {{received}} an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from {{him at the}} advice of the UK government in 2008. Mugabe holds several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded to him in the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984. On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986; {{this is the first time}} one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.|$|E
5|$|In the case, the Court {{examined}} {{whether it}} could review the executive's discretionary power under sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). Section 8 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs {{to make an}} order directing that a person be detained without trial if the President is satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore, while section 10 allows the Minister to suspend detention orders and <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> suspensions {{as he or she}} thinks fit.|$|E

5|$|Nicaragua's president, José Santos Zelaya, wanted <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> {{commercial}} concessions {{granted to}} American companies, and American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under Juan Estrada. Nicaragua was in debt to foreign powers, and the U.S. was unwilling that an alternate canal route {{fall into the}} hands of Europeans. Zelaya's elected successor, José Madriz, could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered, and in August 1910, the Estrada forces took Managua, the capital. The U.S. compelled Nicaragua to accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues. The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops to begin the United States occupation of Nicaragua, which lasted until 1933.|$|E
5|$|Strauss and Senator Brien McMahon, {{author of}} the 1946 McMahon Act, pushed Eisenhower <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> Oppenheimer's {{security}} clearance. On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, pending resolution {{of a series of}} charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, General Manager of the AEC. The hearing that followed in April–May 1954, which was initially confidential and not made public, focused on Oppenheimer's past Communist ties and his association during the Manhattan Project with suspected disloyal or Communist scientists. The US Department of Energy made public the full text of the transcript in October 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
