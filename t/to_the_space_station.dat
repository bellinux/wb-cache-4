5|$|The United States Air Force {{intended}} to use the Gemini spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System and later the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL). These stations would have been launched by Titan IIIM rockets, with a Gemini spacecraft atop, {{eliminating the need for}} rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications were made to the Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the heat shield to allow access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
50|$|Progress M1 {{is another}} variant, capable of {{carrying}} more propellant (but less total cargo) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>stations.</b> There have been 11 of these flights.|$|R
50|$|Wilcutt was {{selected}} as an astronaut candidate in 1990; he piloted missions STS-68 (1994) and STS-79 (1996). Wilcutt commanded mission STS-89 (1998) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mir <b>space</b> <b>station</b> and STS-106 (2000) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> International <b>Space</b> <b>Station.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Rebels {{relocate}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>stations</b> of Nespis VIII, {{where they}} {{discover that the}} Alliance had evacuated Pinnacle Base before it was destroyed.

5|$|The day's {{schedule}} {{also included}} the installation and {{alignment of the}} centerline camera in {{the centre of the}} Orbiter Docking System. The camera later assisted Commander Ken Cameron in final piloting tasks as Atlantis moved towards and docked with Mir. At 5:00am CST (11:00UTC) on day 2, Atlantis was about 4,000statute miles behind Mir, and was closing in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>station</b> {{at a rate of about}} 380statute miles per orbit.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Dr. Schenker {{reveals that}} the {{antidote}} for the chemical reagent is located in H.A.R.M.'s space station. Cate travels to a small island located in the Caribbean, where she infiltrates a secret launch facility. Cate discovers that a rocket will be sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>station</b> that afternoon to collect some antidote. Disguised as a H.A.R.M. space agent, Cate boards the rocket and travels to H.A.R.M.'s space station. While she is searching for the antidote, the space station is struck by a meteor shower, causing it to implode. Cate obtains a large antidote sample and uses an escape pod to return to Earth safely.|$|E
5|$|Khan lures Enterprise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>station</b> Regula I, and he {{launches}} a surprise attack that disables Kirk's ship. Kirk tricks Khan {{by using a}} special code to remotely lower Reliants shields, allowing Enterprise to inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw to make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on Regula I. Spock deceives Khan into thinking that Enterprise is crippled, surprising Khan when Enterprise rescues Kirk and escapes to the nearby Mutara Nebula. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots Reliant into the nebula, where shields and sensors are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, Enterprise defeats Reliant and Khan is severely wounded. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan quotes Ahab's words of vengeance from Moby Dick as he watches Enterprise try to escape.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Thomas {{was chosen}} by ESA for a six-month mission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> International <b>Space</b> <b>Station</b> {{starting}} in November 2016.
