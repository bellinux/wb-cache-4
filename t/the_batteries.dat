40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{the current}} {{maintenance}} of <b>the</b> lead-acid <b>batteries</b> on CDMA bases, this paper analyses {{the main reasons for}} <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> failure and puts forward the system for the remote monitoring and control of <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> It introduces <b>the</b> parameters about <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> current, voltage and temperature as well as the power relay working theory. Furthermore, the remote monitoring platform is developed to monitor <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> working states in real time. With the data analyzed, the automatic control will get started to charge/discharge <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> <b>The</b> system can prolong the working life of <b>the</b> lead-acid <b>battery</b> effectively and improve <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> maintenance efficiency so as to reduce the maintenance cost...|$|R

5|$|From 1714 onwards, about 52 {{batteries}} and redoubts were {{built around the}} coasts of Malta and Gozo. A few of <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> were built around existing coastal watchtowers, such as Qawra and Aħrax Towers. Most of <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> were destroyed over the years or are in ruins, but a few are still more or less intact, including Mistra, Vendôme, Ferretti, St. Anthony's, Qolla l-Bajda and St. Mary's Batteries. Very few redoubts survive, including Briconet, Ximenes and St. George Redoubts. Various entrenchments were also built between the 1720s and 1760s, both around the coastline and along some inland positions. The remains of a few still survive today, including the Naxxar Entrenchment and the Louvier Entrenchment.|$|E
5|$|Adelaide's first {{experiment}} with electric powered trams was a demonstration {{run on the}} Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's line. A battery powered tram fitted with Julien's Patent Electric Traction ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Rosseau gave {{orders for}} the French frigates to sail once more, {{slipping}} away from the British ships which had drifted {{to the north and}} anchoring safely between <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and the island of Tatihou. Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up, Grant sent messages to Malcolm's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements. Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November, maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to drag her anchors. Captain Fraycinet-Saulce was forced to throw much of the ship's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore. The following day, Diana took advantage of the rising tide to attack the anchored Amazone, Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from <b>the</b> <b>batteries.</b> Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate, each time beaten off by heavy fire from <b>the</b> <b>batteries.</b> Joined by Malcolm and the remainder of the British force, four successive attacks were launched against Amazone, each one driven back by cannon fire. At 13:00, with the tide falling, the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water, out of range of the French. All four British ships had suffered under fire, with two killed and five wounded on Revenge, three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana. French losses were a single man killed on Amazone.|$|E

5|$|The {{calculator}} was {{powered by}} a Texas Instruments TMC1802NC, a metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit with 7000 transistors. This CPU normally consumes 350 milliwatts, but by pulsing the power this requirement was reduced to 20 milliwatts.

50|$|This method {{converts}} {{a reading}} of <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> voltage to SoC, using the known discharge curve (voltage vs. SoC) of <b>the</b> <b>battery.</b> However, <b>the</b> voltage is more significantly affected by <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> current (due to <b>the</b> <b>battery's</b> electrochemical kinetics) and temperature.

30|$|A battery has {{a limited}} service life.

5|$|Diplomacy failed despite {{continuing}} pressure {{applied by}} the Allies against Athens.

Du Fournet was instructed not {{to use force to}} take possession of <b>the</b> <b>batteries.</b> The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, as well as the army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.|$|E
5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea.

5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge <b>the</b> <b>batteries,</b> air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E
5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E
5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to {{take three}} ships of the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage <b>the</b> <b>batteries</b> to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} about France {{rose in the}} 1880s and an electrically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. Additional contact mines were added, forcing incoming vessels to sail into a channel alongside St Mawes, illuminated with electric search lights. As part of this transformation, the castle's 64-pounder guns were partially replaced with light, quick-firing guns in the 1890s, able to engage any torpedo boats or mine sweepers attempting {{to break through the}} defences. <b>The</b> <b>batteries</b> for these were found to be poorly sited, and an additional battery was therefore built above the Henrician castle between 1900 and 1901, again for housing quick-firing guns.|$|E
5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions.
