5|$|As {{a result}} of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's {{politicians}} became divided between <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Republicans. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the National Republican Party. Because of Crittenden's support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Texas {{declared}} {{independence from}} the Republic of Mexico on March 2, 1836. At the time {{the vast majority of}} the Texian population favored the annexation of the Republic by the United States. The leadership of both major U.S. political parties, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Whigs, opposed the introduction of Texas, a vast slave-holding region, into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress. Moreover, they wished to avoid a war with Mexico, whose government refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province. With Texas's economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s, the President of the Texas Republic, Sam Houston, arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence, with Great Britain mediating.|$|E
25|$|Instead, Sumner helped {{organize}} the Free Soil Party, which opposed both <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Whigs, who had nominated Zachary Taylor, a slave-owning Southerner, for President. Sumner ran for U.S. Representative as a Free Soil candidate and lost.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} several {{unsuccessful}} proposals at consolidation before 1854. The main opposition of consolidation {{came from the}} Whig Party. The Whigs usually dominated Philadelphia City elections while the outlying districts were dominated by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Whigs feared they would lose power within the city. With support from all the city's major newspapers, the consolidation overcame Whig opposition and the issue {{was brought to the}} Pennsylvania General Assembly.|$|E

25|$|Results of {{previous}} {{elections in the}} Hong Kong Island constituency has fuelled the expectation of 60:40 vote split between <b>the</b> <b>democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> loyalists. As long as the pro-democratic camp coordinated successfully to nominate a single candidate, they have a higher chance of winning. To that end, the pro-democracy camp agreed to unite behind a single candidate; the Liberal Party and the DAB bargained behind closed doors. Each party or group confirmed their candidate on or before 10 September.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{economic}} conditions caused voters to turn against the Republican Party. In the 1874 congressional elections, the Democrats assumed {{control of the}} House. Public opinion {{made it difficult for}} the Grant administration to develop a coherent policy regarding the Southern states. The North began to steer away from Reconstruction. With the depression, ambitious railroad building programs crashed across the South, leaving most states deep in debt and burdened with heavy taxes. Retrenchment was a common response of southern states to state debts during the depression. One by one, each Southern state fell to <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Republicans lost power.|$|E
500|$|The new {{legislature}} {{convened in}} Columbus on Monday, January3, 1898. [...] In the state House of Representatives, nine anti-Hanna Republicans {{aligned with the}} Democrats, electing one of the nine as Speaker. [...] In the state Senate, an anti-Hanna Republican did not initially attend, allowing the Democrats to organize the chamber and elect {{one of their own}} as president of the body. [...] The various legislative offices were divided between <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> insurgent Republicans. [...] Democratic forces in the Ohio Senate were boosted when the absent Republican appeared and voted with them. [...] A margin of three in the House and two in the Senate translated into a likely margin of five against Hanna on the senatorial vote, meaning that three legislators would have to switch sides for him to retain his position.|$|E

500|$|Boortz {{criticizes the}} major parties saying [...] "I believe that the {{principal}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Republicans is that the Democrats just want to grow our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do." [...] He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil liberties. He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility. He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man-made. His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans, who, due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians, make {{up the majority of}} his listeners and callers.|$|E
500|$|During {{his term}} as state senator, Seward {{traveled}} extensively, {{going to visit}} other anti-Jackson leaders, including former president Adams. He also accompanied his father Samuel Seward {{on a trip to}} Europe, where they met the political men of the day. Seward hoped that the Anti-Masons would nominate Supreme Court Justice John McLean for president against Jackson's re-election bid in 1832, but the nomination fell to former Attorney General William Wirt. [...] Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, an opponent of Jackson, was a Mason, and thus unacceptable as party standard-bearer. In the aftermath of Jackson's easy victory, many of those who opposed him believed a united front necessary to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Whig Party gradually came into being. [...] The Whigs believed in legislative action to develop the country, and opposed Jackson's unilateral actions as president, which they deemed imperial. Many Anti-Masons, including Seward and Weed, readily joined the new party.|$|E
500|$|Hanna {{stated that}} he would accept no office in the McKinley administration, as he feared it {{would be seen as}} a reward for his {{political}} efforts. [...] He had long wished to be a senator, speaking of this desire as early as 1892. [...] Senator Sherman, now aged almost 74, faced a difficult re-election battle with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Foraker faction in 1898. [...] On January 4, 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the office of Secretary of State; he immediately accepted. [...] The poor record Sherman posted prior to his departure from office in 1898 led to attacks on Hanna, suggesting that a senile man had been placed in a key Cabinet position to accommodate him. Foraker, in his memoirs, strongly implied that Sherman was moved out of the way to allow Hanna to have his Senate seat. [...] An embittered Sherman stated in a letter after his departure as secretary, [...] "When [...] urged me to accept the position of Secretary of State, I accepted with some reluctance and largely to promote the wishes of Mark Hanna. [...] The result was that I lost the position both of Senator and Secretary... They deprived me of the high office of Senator by the temporary appointment as Secretary of State." ...|$|E

500|$|David Knight {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Adelaide Review, and wrote of its author, [...] "He {{is one of the}} finest exponents of polemic journalism, and regularly punches the reader in the gut with analogies and metaphors that brutally describe the world around him." [...] Knight observed, [...] "Taibbi’s been called the modern Hunter S. Thompson many times, but unlike the overrated gonzo pioneer, Taibbi is able to brutally assess what’s going on as well as cover the mood of the public with humour, heart and venom minus the ego." [...] His review concluded, [...] "Here his venom is not aimed at Middle America but the Republican Party, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> media. Writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, journalist Chris Potter compared the book to Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 by Hunter S. Thompson, commenting, [...] "Nearly a half-century later, another Rolling Stone writer, Matt Taibbi, has assembled a selection of his own 2016 reports. And — spoiler alert! — the outcome is arguably not much different." [...] Potter criticized the work for not devoting more space to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. He lamented, [...] "I wish Mr. Taibbi had delved into the Kremlin's meddling in the 2016 election, which was on display as early as last fall. He's lived in, and written extensively about, contemporary Russia, and might have revealed some interesting correspondences between the political culture there and here." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} mascot {{symbol for the}} party has been the donkey, or jackass. Andrew Jackson's enemies twisted his name to [...] "jackass" [...] as a term of ridicule {{regarding}} a stupid and stubborn animal. However, the Democrats liked the common-man implications {{and picked it up}} too, so the image persisted and evolved. Its most lasting impression came from the cartoons of Thomas Nast from 1870 in Harper's Weekly. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> elephant to represent the Republicans.|$|E
2500|$|Upon Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, who {{had been}} elected with Lincoln in 1864 as vice president, became president. Johnson rejected the Radical program of Reconstruction and instead appointed his own governors and tried to finish reconstruction {{by the end of}} 1865. Thaddeus Stevens vehemently opposed President Johnson's plans for an abrupt end to Reconstruction, insisting that Reconstruction must [...] "revolutionize Southern institutions, habits, and manners... The foundations of their institutions... must be broken up and relaid, or all our blood and treasure have been spent in vain." [...] Johnson broke decisively with the Republicans in Congress when he vetoed the Civil Rights Act in early 1865. While Democrats cheered, the Republicans pulled together, passed the bill again, and overturned Johnson's repeat veto. Full-scale political warfare now existed between Johnson (now allied with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Radical Republicans.|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{it was the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, {{rather than}} the Compromise of 1850, that would serve as the {{catalyst}} to partisan re-alignment. Pierce demanded that all loyal Democrats support the act, hoping that the Kansas-Nebraska Act and debates over {{the development of the}} West would reinvigorate partisan conflict and distract from intra-party battles. But the bill instead polarized legislators sectional lines, with Southern Whigs providing critical votes in the House as a narrow majority of Northern Democrats voted against it. Congressional Democrats suffered huge losses in the mid-term elections of 1854, voting instead for a wide array of new parties opposed to <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kansas-Nebraska Act. In many Midwestern states, a coalition of Free Soilers and Northern Whigs, many of whom were no longer willing to cooperate with Southern Whigs {{in the aftermath of the}} latter's support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, formed a new coalition that became known as the Republican Party. The party lambasted the institution of slavery and opposed the Fugitive Slave Act and the extension of slavery into the territories. In other Midwestern states, opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Democratic Party merely labeled themselves the [...] "Opposition." [...] In other parts of the country, many Whigs refused to abandon their party. But the Know Nothing movement, seizing on growing fears of Catholic immigrants, defeated numerous Northeastern and Southern congressional candidates from both the Whig and Democratic parties. In Pierce's home state of New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. The elections left Democrats in the minority in the House, although they retained control of the Senate. Nathaniel Banks, a member of the Know Nothings and the Free Soil Party, won election as Speaker of the House after a protracted battle.|$|E
