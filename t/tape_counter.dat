50|$|Typical {{features}} include; headphones, foot pedals, {{adjustable speed}} control, <b>tape</b> <b>counter,</b> backspace feature, pause, search.|$|E

50|$|In {{prototyping}} {{of electronic}} circuits, a decade box {{is a type}} of test equipment {{that can be used to}} substitute the interchanging of different values of certain passive components with a single variable output. Decade boxes are made for resistance, capacitance, and inductance, the values of which can be increased incrementally by way of switching the points of contact for the input and output throughout a series of the respective components. The interface for these devices will usually consist of dials or adjustable <b>tape</b> <b>counters,</b> and are operated in-circuit and without any external power source.|$|R
50|$|The {{half-inch}} tape used contained {{two parallel}} quarter-inch tracks, {{one for each}} side. It had a recording time of 4 hours per side, later extended to 8 hours per side on a few models. Machines had a 'real time' <b>tape</b> position <b>counter</b> with the information retained on the tape, so when tapes were loaded the position was known; this feature was only implemented on VHS recorders much later. V2000 became available in early 1979, later than its two rivals. The V2000 system did not sell well, and was discontinued in 1985.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} {{predict the}} behavior of formulas with feedback requires the more sophisticated analysis of sequential circuits. Propositional formulas with feedback lead, in their simplest form, to state machines; they also lead to memories {{in the form of}} Turing <b>tapes</b> and counter-machine <b>counters.</b> From combinations of these elements one can build any sort of bounded computational model (e.g. Turing machines, counter machines, register machines, Macintosh computers, etc.).|$|R

5000|$|As the Datasette lacked any random {{read-write}} access, users had {{to either}} wait while the tape ran its length, while the computer printed messages like [...] "SEARCHING FOR ALIEN BOXING... FOUND AFO... FOUND SPACE INVADERS... FOUND PAC-MAN... FOUND ALIEN BOXING... LOADING..." [...] or else {{rely on a}} <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> number to find the starting location of programs on cassette. <b>Tape</b> <b>counter</b> speeds varied over different datasette units making recorded counter numbers unreliable on different hardware.|$|E
50|$|Initially solid, {{thick-walled}} drip pipes {{were used}} in trials at the CSIRO but subsequent trials between 1995 and 1998 demonstrated that drip tapes (thin-walled, flexible pipe) could be used very effectively. The loss of strength from using thin-walled drip <b>tapes</b> was <b>countered</b> by the additional tensile strength of the entire system (base layer, drip tape and geotextile). While significantly reducing the cost of SSTI, the use of drip tapes also permitted the use of large diameter drip lines (of up to 35mm) allowing for run lengths up to one (1) kilometre. The thin, flexible wall of drip tape also meant that master rolls of manufactured product could be much larger (over 600m in length).|$|R
50|$|Urwick’s {{application}} of the span of control to business was not met without criticism. Herbert A. Simon questioned the theoretical soundness of the concept and suggested that a restricted span of control would produce excessive red <b>tape.</b> Urwick <b>countered</b> this criticism by noting that if span of control is appropriately implemented this will not occur. Burleigh B. Gardner criticised span of control as prohibiting democratic participation within the organisation. Urwick countered this criticism by noting that too wide of a span of control reduces democracy because it prevents subordinates from having meaningful interaction with superiors. Additionally, other scholars criticised the principle as incorrect because of examples of efficient organisations that has an expanded span of control. Urwick addressed this criticism by noting that in these situations subordinates' work did not overlock. Therefore, these organisations were exceptions.|$|R
40|$|Several {{insertion}} {{operations are}} studied applied to languages accepted by one-way and two-way deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines. These operations {{are defined by}} the ideals obtained from relations such as the prefix, infix, sux and outfix relations. The insertion of regular languages and other languages into deterministic reversal-bounded multicounter languages is also studied. The {{question of whether the}} resulting languages can always be ac-cepted by deterministic machines with the same number of turns on the input tape, the same number of counters, and reversals on the counters is investi-gated. In addition, the question of whether they can always be accepted by increasing either the number of input <b>tape</b> turns, <b>counters,</b> or counter reversals is addressed. The results in this paper form a complete characterization based on these parameters. Towards these new results, a new technique is created for simultaneously showing a language cannot be accepted by both one-way deter-ministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines, and by two-way deterministic machines with one reversal-bounded counter...|$|R

50|$|The Steno-Cassette is {{an analog}} {{cassette}} format for dictation, introduced by Grundig in 1971. It gained widespread use in Germany, {{where it was}} established as a DIN standard (DIN 32750) in 1985. It is easily distinguished from other dictation cassette formats (such as the Microcassette) by the integrated <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> index, showing the amount of tape available.|$|E
50|$|The seventies saw the {{introduction}} of the first mini index cassette for dictation devices with integrated <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> - Steno Cassette 30. Grundig also produced the Stenorette 2002, featuring the first desktop dictation system with the K 30 Steno cassette and the Stenorette SL, a portable dictation system for use {{both in and out of}} the office. Both products were manufactured for nearly twenty years.|$|E
40|$|Multitape Turing {{machines}} {{which can}} use their storage <b>tapes</b> only as <b>counters</b> or as pushdown stores are investigated. The memory access restrictions are produced by regarding the machines as small computers (as in the formalism of Wang) and by restricting the instruction repertoires. Relationships are given linking machines which only accept or reject inputs and machines which emit output sequences {{as a function of}} their input. It is shown that without restrictions on computing time or amount of tape used that only six distinct classes of sets of strings (languages) are produced by the above memory access restrictions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} power of reversal-bounded ATMs (alternating Turing machines). The results {{obtained}} are as follows: (1) Every recursively enumerable set can be accepted by a 1 -tape- 1 -counter ATM which runs in constant reversals (which are {{the number of times}} a head changes direction) but not by any 1 -tape- 1 -counter NTM (nondeterministic TM) which runs in constant reversals, where a 1 -tape- 1 -counter ATM (NTM, respectively) is a 1 -tape ATM (NTM, respectively) with one <b>counter</b> <b>tape.</b> (2) For functions B(n) and R(n) satisfying B(n) ≦ 2 O(R(n)) and B(n) R(n) ≧ n, a class of languages accepted by 1 -tape ATMs which run in O(R(n)) reversal and O(B(n)) leaf simultaneously is equivalent to a class of languages accepted by NTMs which run in O(B(n) R(n)) space...|$|R
50|$|Akai {{produced}} consumer {{video cassette}} recorders (VCR) during the 1980s. The Akai VS-2 {{was the first}} VCR with an on-screen display, originally named the Interactive Monitor System. By displaying the information directly on the television screen, this innovation eliminated {{the need for the}} user to be physically near the VCR to program recording, read the <b>tape</b> <b>counter,</b> or perform other common features. Within a few years, all competing manufacturers had adopted on-screen display technology in their own products.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the system}} needed to write data, the user was {{notified}} to press [...] "RECORD" [...] on the cassette recorder, then press [...] "RETURN" [...] {{on the keyboard}} to notify the system that the cassette recorder was recording. The system wrote a sound to provide time synchronization, then modulated sounds that encoded a prefix, the data, a checksum and a suffix. When the system needed to read data, the user was instructed to press [...] "PLAY" [...] on the cassette recorder. The system would listen to the sounds on the tape waiting until a burst of sound could be recognized as the synchronization. The system would then interpret subsequent sounds as data. When the data read was complete, the system would notify the user to press [...] "STOP" [...] on the cassette recorder. It was primitive, but it worked (a lot of the time). Data was stored sequentially, usually in an unnamed format, although some systems (such as the Commodore PET series of computers) did allow the files to be named. Multiple sets of data could be written and located by fast-forwarding the tape and observing at the <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> to find the approximate start of the next data region on the tape. The user might {{have to listen to}} the sounds to find the right spot to begin playing the next data region. Some implementations even included audible sounds interspersed with the data.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, some {{citizens}} {{opposed the}} City's decision to expend $6 {{million on the}} Phase 1 closure (at Macdonald Street) for only 8 blocks of Point Grey Road, redesignating it from a popular commuter motorist arterial for all users to a bike-prioritized path with all commuter motorist traffic removed. Another bike path already existed on nearby 3rd Avenue. Despite the cost and restricted use concerns, the Vision-Party-majority City Council proceeded with its inland extension of the False Creek seawall and greenway along local, residential Point Grey Road. Council's decision was primarily {{for the safety of}} cyclists by removing the high volumes of commuting motorists. The City Council opted to channel the Seaside Greenway inland to Point Grey Road rather than continue the seawall at the seaside, which would have involved negotiating the riparian rights of homeowners and ecological considerations of foreshore wildlife. Increased citizen opposition and outrage arose in 2016 when the City opted to spend another $6.4 million on Phase 2 -- extensive sidewalk widening and road narrowing -- on the same 8 blocks of Point Grey Road. In addition to the objections about cost, the Phase 2 City-engineered design (by David Rawsthorne) was determined by independent Road Safety engineers to be redundant and unsafe (Geoffrey Ho Engineering Consultants Inc.), likely to cause more casualties from the ingress/egress of 80 residential driveways. Yet, the Vision-Party-led City Council, which had rejected (as too dramatic, expensive and challenging for driveway safety) the option in 2013 (Phase 1) of reconfiguring the road by using the right-of-way, decided in 2016 (Phase 2) to implement this reconfiguration despite the high cost, substantial changes to the local neighbourhood and road use, safety risks and on-going public opposition (Video of City Engineer Jerry Dobrovolny at City Council Vote on the project on July 25, 2013, <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> 25:35). The NPA Party members on Council (in minority) all voted against the Phase 2 design. In addition, other citizens disapprove of Phase 2's over-engineering, with its extensive concrete paving over old growth trees and green space, which may endanger the biodiversity and ecological sustainability of the neighbourhood.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{some new}} models of infinite-state transition systems. The basic model, called a (reversal-bounded) counter machine (CM), is a nondeterministic finite automaton augmented with finitely many reversal-bounded counters (i. e. each counter can be incremented or decremented by 1 and tested for zero, {{but the number}} of times it can change mode from nondecreasing to nonincreasing and vice-versa is bounded by a constant, independent of the computation). We extend a CM by augmenting it with some familiar data structures: (i) A pushdown counter machine (PCM) is a CM augmented with an unrestricted pushdown stack. (ii) A <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> machine (TCM) is a CM augmented with a two-way read/write worktape that is restricted in that the number of times the head crosses the boundary between any two adjacent cells of the worktape is bounded by a constant, independent of the computation (thus, the worktape is finite-crossing).

30|$|In recent years, {{fractional}} calculus {{has become}} an intriguing field. There are several definitions of the fractional-order derivative. Among them, the definitions commonly used are the Riemann-Liouville definition, the Grünwald-Letnikov definition [15], and the Caputo definition [16]. The Caputo derivative is reformulated from the more classic Riemann-Liouville derivative, and the initial conditions for Caputo fractional differential equations are expressed {{in the same manner}} as for integer-order differential equations [15]. For this reason, in this paper, we use the Caputo derivative. This is likely to be a good choice to solve problems in the dynamics of complex systems because the order of derivatives can be any real or complex number. Especially, the results may more closely resemble realistic dynamics than integer-order systems [17]. The advantages of fractional calculus support its use in applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and even finance and social sciences [18]. Some examples include data-fitting problems for blood alcohol level, video <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> readings and models for world population growth [19], obesity epidemics [20], Ebola epidemics [21], and bovine babesiosis disease and tick populations [22].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{some new}} models of infinite-state transition systems. The basic model, called a (reversal-bounded) counter machine (CM), is a nondeterministic finite automaton augmented with finitely many reversal-bounded counters (i. e. each counter can be incremented or decremented by 1 and tested for zero, {{but the number}} of times it can change mode from nondecreasing to nonincreasing and vice-versa is bounded by a constant, independent of the computation). We extend a CM by augmenting it with some familiar data structures: (i) A pushdown counter machine (PCM) is a CM augmented with an unrestricted pushdown stack. (ii) A <b>tape</b> <b>counter</b> machine (TCM) is a CM augmented with a two-way read/write worktape that is restricted in that the number of times the head crosses the boundary between any two adjacent cells of the worktape is bounded by a constant, independent of the computation (thus, the worktape is finite-crossing). There is no bound on how long the head can remain on a cell. (iii) A queue counter machine (QCM) is a CM augmented with a queue that is restricted in that the number of alternations between non-deletion phase and non-insertion phase is bounded by a constant. A non-deletion (non-insertion) phase is a period consisting of insertions (deletions) and no-changes, i. e., the queue is idle. We show that emptiness, (binary, forward, and backward) reachability, nonsafety, and invariance for these machines are solvable. We also look at extensions of the models that allow the use of linear-relation tests among the counters and parameterized constants as “primitive ” predicates. We investigate the conditions under which these problems are still solvable. ...|$|E
