[...] means Way of the Cross, literally the stations of the cross presented along {{a way to be}} walked in meditation, but often a general description of the way of a Christian following Jesus [...] "carrying the cross" [...] in life and death. The text refers indirectly to the Gospel. Although there is no explicit reference to the sick man in the text, he appears as a follower of Christ who bears his cross and suffers torment until the end, when in the words of [...] "God shall wipe away <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> their eyes". The cantata accordingly takes as its starting point the torment that the faithful must endure, told in the first person.|$|E

Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I {{just want you to}} know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me." [...] Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it [...] "made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{completed}} the scenario, Wagner began writing the libretto in 1862, and followed this by composing the overture. The overture was publicly performed in Leipzig on 2 November 1862, {{conducted by the}} composer. Composition of act 1 was begun in spring of 1863 in the Viennese suburb of Penzing, but the opera in its entirety was not finished until October 1867, when Wagner was living at Tribschen near Lucerne. These years were some of Wagner's most difficult: the 1861 Paris production of Tannhäuser was a fiasco, Wagner gave up hope of completing Der Ring des Nibelungen, the 1864 Vienna production of Tristan und Isolde was abandoned after 77 rehearsals, and finally in 1866 Wagner's first wife, Minna died. Cosima Wagner was later to write: [...] "When future generations seek refreshment in this unique work, may they spare a thought for <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> which the smiles arose." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 1898 publication, Topsy Tinkle recounted a {{story that}} the Indians told about a natural spring located {{on the site of}} the Old Mill. The story told of a 16-year-old Indian named Catalina with [...] "thick, jet-black hair" [...] and [...] "big, melting black eyes." [...] Catalina lived in the time of the San Gabriel Mission and gave roses to the Virgin Mary in hopes that she could win the heart of the {{handsome}} Jose, even hoping that [...] "something dreadful" [...] would happen to another girl of whom Jose was fond. When Jose left for two years serving on a ship, Catalina turned her back on the Virgin, and Catalina began praying to the old [...] "Mexican god", described as a [...] "hideous clay image". Catalina died of sorrow when Jose did not return, and her body was buried on the spot where the mill was later built, a spot from which a natural flow of spring water [...] "slowly oozes". According to the legend, oozing spring water is [...] "only <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> a loving woman's broken heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|If God is ever to {{wipe away}} <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> the face of man this age-long wrong [...] must be overthrown. If the mission of Jesus is ever to get the upperhand in human affairs, the social {{revolution}} must come to pass. There is no more good news to the poor unless there is the message and the task to abolish this age-long night of poverty. There is no deliverance for captives unless this social captivity is ended. There is no setting at liberty {{the people that are}} bruised unless this age-long bruising machinery is stopped. If we are ever to call the poor and the maimed and the halt to the banquet of creation, the program of the revolution must be inaugurated. The Heavenly Father may know we have need of all these things, and He may have provided for these needs in the limitless resources of nature, but we never can have them for the people except by seeking the kingdom of social justice and human brotherhood — which is the Kingdom of God — which is the social vision of the social revolution.|$|E
