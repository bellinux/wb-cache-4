5|$|General Papagos rushed Greek {{units to}} the Metsovon pass where the Germans were {{expected}} to attack.

50|$|As {{developed}} between 1894 and 1909, the Kansan Stage {{was based on}} a model that assumed that the Pleistocene deposits contained only two glacial tills and one volcanic ash bed within Nebraska and Kansas. Of these two proposed glacial <b>tills,</b> <b>the</b> Kansan <b>till,</b> which defined <b>the</b> Kansan Stage, was the upper of <b>the</b> two glacial <b>tills</b> and <b>the</b> Nebraskan <b>till,</b> which defined <b>the</b> Nebraskan Stage, was the lower of <b>the</b> two glacial <b>tills.</b> It was argued that a single paleosol developed in <b>the</b> Nebraskan <b>till</b> and interglacial deposits separated the Kansan and Nebraskan <b>tills.</b> <b>The</b> paleosol and deposits were used to define the Aftonian (interglacial) stage that separated the Kansan and Nebraskan stages.|$|R

The 3 He profiles show that the lower 80 % of <b>the</b> <b>till</b> formed in <b>the</b> past 310 – 43 k. y. under sublimation rates averaging > 7 m·m. y. − 1 (meters per million years). Such rapid recent growth of <b>the</b> <b>till</b> contradicts previous interpretations that it is older than 8. 1 Ma at an adjacent site, where it encloses volcanic ash of this age.
