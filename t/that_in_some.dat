5|$|I {{was anxious}} that such details {{should be put}} on record because some of these {{regional}} cooking pots are already becoming {{very hard to find}} in France, so <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> sense Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E
5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the NBA {{agreed with}} the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an {{arrangement}} that has remained the same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which means <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E
5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis {{is driven by}} the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of {{metabolic}} process they employ, the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes. The Planctomycetes are the exception (as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is able to take in large molecules via a process <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> ways resembles endocytosis, the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.|$|E
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases an individual should pursue {{a course of action}} that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E

5|$|Tunbridge Wells local {{elections}} show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party dominance, {{apart from a}} two-year period from 1994 to 1996 of no overall control and a two-year period from 1996 to 1998 when the Liberal Democrats held a majority. The most recent elections, held in May 2008, gave the Conservatives a large majority with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats' four. The extent of the Conservatives' dominance is further illustrated by the fact <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> wards (e.g. Park) Labour did not even field a candidate in the 2008 council elections.|$|E
