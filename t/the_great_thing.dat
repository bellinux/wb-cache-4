He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E

Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you and what you have become. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about us is that we have made us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off.

It happens to be a scene where I basically approach , and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> is he—and I don't want to give too much away—but he's in disrepair at the time I find him. It was really fun seeing him play this really powerful character who's half in the bag."

[...] Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a [...] "lot of empathy" [...] toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had [...] "terrible fathers". Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the [...] "last hope for Westeros".

Executive {{producer}} Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode, and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters. He said that although Dan Castellaneta’s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright’s voicing of Bart changed as well, because [...] "it was lower-register, {{and you can see}} in the difference in this segment. It was really funny to get the interplay [...] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> is we didn’t have to ask—we already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons." [...] He also revealed that the segment expanded on an earlier episode which implied that the Ullman Simpsons were murdered and buried under the family home, stating [...] "if people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it." ...|$|E

He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> this show gives us, just when you think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E

[...] Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, [...] "it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless." [...] A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris asking for money and stating [...] "I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume," [...] and Peter replying with [...] "it's just sitting there right now, {{but you know what}} <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done." [...] Peter's ancestor shown preparing to wrestle with a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "a very strange gag," [...] which was added after the other parts of the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity-laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie.|$|E

This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been. She's recovering." ...|$|E

He further explained, [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end.

500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> {{about the fact that}} I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

[...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E
