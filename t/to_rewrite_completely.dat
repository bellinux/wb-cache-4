50|$|Production censors {{objected to}} {{several aspects of}} the {{original}} script, which included the two characters cohabiting without the formality of marriage (as in the book).

25|$|Although {{the idea}} of doing a {{straight}} re-release of the game initially seemed like a straight-forward task, the implementation proved somewhat more complicated, due to the different architectures of a PC and a DS.

50|$|After Gurdjieff was in {{a serious}} car {{accident}} in 1924, he decided to pass on something of his theoretical teachings by writing a number of detailed books. After many writings and rewritings, the first volume was released under the title Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson. Gurdjieff first mainly dictated Beelzebub's Tales in Russian and Armenian between 1924 and 1927, as he was initially unable to write personally because of his condition after the accident.

50|$|In SmartFrog, every {{component}} {{is defined as}} a template. Typically for every new service, new components are created and activated. However, some general purpose components can be reused in different service. For the template mechanism, system configuration is easy to adapt to different requirements and the default configuration can be kept. Prototyping also allows keeping all the transformation and history of configurations of the system. Using SmartFrog to build large-scale distributed system, one can reuse some components and doesn’t need <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> <b>rewrite</b> the whole application. Users can easily write or create simple SmartFrog components to install, uninstall, configure, start, and stop the system using the configuration description notation.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the film}} has been noted for its semi-humorous screenplay, it was adapted from a more {{straightforward}} novel by Gary Brandner which {{was first published in}} 1977. After drafts by Jack Conrad (the original director who left following difficulties with the studio) and Terence H. Winkless proved unsatisfactory, director Joe Dante hired John Sayles <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> <b>rewrite</b> the script. The two had collaborated before on Dante's 1978 film Piranha. Sayles rewrote the script with the same self-aware, satirical tone that he gave Piranha, and his finished draft bears only a vague resemblance to Brandner's book. However, Winkless still received a co-writer's credit along with Sayles for his work on the screenplay.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Grids {{started as}} an {{approach}} to scientific computing and they are now gaining importance also in commercial sector thanks to web services. These are a fine way to implement services oriented architectures that enable organizations to expose their profiled and specialized applications so others can use them in different application scenarios. However, exposing services {{that used to be}} of internal nature, immediately brings security to the front line. In addition, {{it is a fact that}} many proprietary solutions already exist and that it is infeasible <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> <b>rewrite</b> them <b>to</b> meet web services specifications. Moreover, some of these services can not be exposed at all due to computational constraints. Thus this paper presents an analysis of possibilities to overcome the above problems for a wider penetration of web services into business environments...|$|R
