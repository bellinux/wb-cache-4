In the article, I explore the influence of <b>transnational</b> corporations' <b>training</b> programs on education as it currently pertains to Central and Eastern European higher education and employment. In addition, multinational corporate entities exercise influence on European Union policy through the role of lobby organizations and activities. I explore the influence of these practices on education with an emphasis on the emerging importance of Western language skills. In addition, I focus on the European Union and its efforts to expand into Central and Eastern Europe in order to provide a focal point for analysis...|$|R

In this article we answer the following question: How do sympathetic interlocutors for IOs emerge in the first place? We address this question by examining how IOs engage in teaching norms to national officials via <b>transnational</b> policy <b>training</b> in order {{to increase the number of}} domestic reformers who are sympathetic to their prescriptions for policy change. We provide a conceptual framework for understanding how IOs seek to use their own cognitive authority to foster ‘diagnostic coordination’ across technocratic economic policy communities. This encourages officials to adapt to a common policy language and delimits the policy space within which they identify and propose solutions to economic problems...|$|R

40|$|Discourses of {{citizenship}} are profoundly powerful tools both for defining membership {{of a national}} community and for establishing the expected dispositions of citizens. Governments and nongovernmental organisations utilise formal and informal education to promote specific understandings {{of citizenship}}. However, efforts to promote citizenship are often marked by tensions and paradoxes in terms of content, delivery and reception of these ideals, not least in negotiating global and national, liberal and neoliberal agendas. This paper explores the rationale for and discourses of citizenship presented through a World Bank-backed on-line, <b>transnational</b> active citizenship <b>training</b> and critically interrogates the explicit and implicit ideologies and understandings of citizenship promoted in the course and certain limitations to these, including the types of ‘active’ citizen proposed and the normalised version of participation and civil society these reflect, and apparent limitations in relation to both state- and citizen disengagement {{as well as the}} continued challenge of promoting security through engagement across difference...|$|R

40|$|The {{graphic arts}} and media sector has been {{affected}} by technological developments, particularly {{in the last years}} of the 20 th century. These developments mainly affect the traditional graphic arts companies which aim at pre-press and printing production processes and workflow. Furthermore, changes are taking place in the entire range of the media industry where the traditional graphic arts sector belongs. Because of these developments, the graphic arts and media sector as well as the print media will need to be reorientated. One of the principal components related to the existence and further development of companies are the employees: that is people and individuals that have any kind of professional relationship with the graphic arts and media sector. The changes in the production environment and the application of new technologies and workflows have led to the increase in the importance of education and training as one of the fundamental factors for sector development. This paper investigates the characteristics of print media within the new structure of the media industry and their relationship to the new electronic processes. Furthermore, the current structure and reform strategies that has been applied in education and training, mainly in European Union countries, is explored. As for the further development of the graphic arts and media sector, a new strategy concerning the future structure of education and training is discussed and suggested. This strategy is based on the development of a <b>transnational</b> educational <b>training</b> system for the graphic arts and media sector at a European level. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of China as a 'world's factory' {{in the new}} millennium was accompanied by the rise of a new working class which was composed of more than 200 million peasant-workers. As internal migrant labourers, these peasant-workers were deprived of citizenship rights to reside in the city and lacked basic labour rights and protections. In order to address the precarious working conditions of migrant workers who were employed by transnational corporations, a global Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) movement emerged, introducing a wide range of transnational corporate codes of conduct, labour standards and labour rights. This article presents a case study of a <b>transnational</b> CSR multi-stakeholder <b>training</b> programme at a Chinese workplace, in an attempt to demonstrate how capital, transnational NGOs and local labour NGOs - and including social workers - are all involved in the project to promote labour rights in China. Specific focus is placed on the role of social workers in enhancing worker participation in this project; the challenges and dilemmas that they encountered in the process, and suggestions are provided regarding the future development of a new model of occupational social work in China.

40|$|Terrorism {{in the new}} {{millennium}} has morphed drastically since the 1970 s. The terrorist organizations of today are a hybrid between the insurgent group models of the 1960 s and modern terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda. This hybrid model has created what has become a <b>transnational</b> insurgency recruited, <b>trained,</b> and led by major terrorist networks such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Even smaller regional groups such as Boko Haram have surpassed merely conducting terrorist attacks. These smaller groups are also focused on controlling territory. Tan (2008) refers to this change as “New Terrorism”. To combat New Terrorism, a combination of counterinsurgency tactics and counterterrorism tactics must be employed. This study will examine the need to define roles and responsibilities for various organization and various echelons through the introduction of a new Special Operations Forces model; Disrupt, Deny, Dismantle. The acronym to be used for this model is D 3. This model recommends different tactics, techniques, and procedures for forces not specifically assigned the counterterrorism mission. As new terrorism continues to change, only counterterrorism forces should be tasked with the Find Fix Finish, Exploit, Analyze, and Disseminate (F 3 EAD) model of targeting (Counterterrorism 2014). All other military and law enforcement elements should disrupt and deny the enemy in support of the counterterrorism effort. This study is based on extensive research and the author’s 23 years of experience serving in U. S. Army Special Forces. Throughout his career, the author interacted with people from various social, economic, and professional backgrounds throughout the Middle East, Africa, and the Balkans...|$|R

The Project Consortium was comprised of ten ESPON European Contact Points (ECPs) – Greece as Lead Partner and nine Project partners (Italy, Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Cyprus, and Malta). The main aim of the ESPONTrain Project was to develop the first ESPON educational platform -a distance learning tool- making ESPON knowledge accessible and familiar to a targeted public, including postgraduate students and practitioners/stakeholders through a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). For this purpose the ESPONTrain partners prepared and delivered a specific ESPON course design where a set of teaching material based {{on a number of}} applied research and targeted analysis ESPON Projects was developed. This ESPON VLE activity was offered to higher education institutions at postgraduate (Masters) level as well as to public and private professionals and policy makers in 10 ESPON countries. ESPONTrain developed six thematic teaching packages (TTPs) based on eight Final Reports of ESPON Priority 1 and Priority 2 projects (see list below). In each ESPONTrain country at least three thematic packages were adapted to the VLE and taught by training experts selected at national level by each participating ECP, through an open nationwide call, following a set of common selection criteria. The trainers came from relevant academic fields and being familiar with ESPON knowledge as well as adequate experience with teaching and e-learning. The Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) was built around an open source Moodle platform. Using this tool, the trainees were able to study and consult the available educational material guided by the training experts, either through asynchronous or synchronous learning (teleconference meetings). Apart from studying the teaching material, students could interact, share opinions, ask questions related to the study text {{as well as to the}} topic in general practice, test their knowledge in quizzes and confront it with the latest outcomes produced within the ESPON 2013 programme. They were also asked to carry out final assignments as part of their final evaluation. The ESPONTrain Project was highly transnational, including countries from different geographical areas (namely Northern Europe, Central Europe, Mediterranean Region and the Balkans) using the experience of different ECPs, either universities or governmental bodies, on the concerned themes and issues. Exchanges between the trainers and the coordinating ECPs were facilitated by the Lead Partner ́s central Technical VLE Team, based in Athens. N/...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn verifying the {{tolerance}} specification and identifying {{the zone of}} conformity of a particular component an adequate determination of the task-related measurement uncertainty relevant to the utilized measurement method is required, in accordance with part one of the standard “Geometrical Product Specifications” {{as well as with}} the “Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement”. Although, measurement uncertainty is a central subject in the field of metrology and is certainly considered to be of significant importance, there is still a perceived lack of knowledge on the subject within employees in the field of quality management and industrial metrology. They are often neither familiar with procedures for the determination of measurement uncertainty nor with the interpretation and analysis of measurement results as well as economic consequences of decisions taken at the level of conformity. Furthermore, in times of increasing globalization relating to products, processes and development, in which ever more producers cooperate with institutes and companies from all over the world, there is a strong demand and need for a <b>transnational</b> vocational <b>training</b> on the topic of measurement uncertainty. For that reason, in the European project MUVoT (“Blended Learning course on measurement uncertainty for advanced vocational training” - Leonardo da Vinci – Transfer of Innovation 2011 - 1 -PL 1 -LEO 05 - 19870), a course for advanced vocational training on the topic of measurement uncertainty was established in cooperation with seven institutes from six European countries to provide an internationally harmonized education programme and thus guarantee a better quality of products through the training of metrologists. The training offer is based on a Blended Learning concept, combining self-dependent learning via a web-based eLearning platform and class teaching in face-to-face workshops. On the one hand, this allows the adaptation to individual knowledge and skills by self-controlled learning of abstract contents. On the other hand, the exercises enable the practical application of typical methods, which are generally considered as quite complex by many employees, and thus assure correct understanding. Furthermore, class teaching in manageable groups of participants offers the possibility of adaption to individual training needs. The integration of vocational training into a job-based application is facilitated, so that the idea of Lifelong Learning is promoted in new fields of application. Taking into consideration, that the target group of this training consists of participants with a very inhomogeneous qualification, including foremen, skilled workers, technicians and engineers, the course contents are provided in a modular structure with preparatory, basic and advanced chapters. By performing pilot courses at each project partner, the course content has been thoroughly tested and feedback has been sought and given allowing for a policy of continuous improvement. This article describes the results of these evaluations and the targeted improvements of the content and overall concept considering the identified competence requirements and needs of the participants...|$|R
40|$|Since El Salvador’s {{civil war}} {{formally}} ended in 1992 the small Central American nation has undergone profound social changes and significant reforms. However, few {{changes have been}} as important or as devastating as the nation’s emergence as a central hub in the transnational criminal “pipeline” or series of recombinant, overlapping chains of routes and actors that illicit organizations use to traffic in drugs, money weapons, human being, endangered animals and other products. The erasing of the once-clear ideological lines that drove {{the civil war and}} the ability of erstwhile enemies to join forces in criminal enterprises in the post-war period is an enduring and dangerous characteristic of El Salvador’s <b>transnational</b> criminal evolution. <b>Trained,</b> elite cadres from both sides, with few legitimate job opportunities, found their skills were marketable in the growing criminal structures. The groups moved from kidnapping and extortion to providing protection services to transnational criminal organizations to becoming integral parts of the organizations themselves. The demand for specialized military and transportation services in El Salvador have exploded as the Mexican DTOs consolidate their hold on the cocaine market and their relationships with the transportista networks, which is still in flux. The value of their services has risen dramatically also {{because of the fact that}} multiple Mexican DTOs, at war with each other in Mexico and seeking to physically control the geographic space of the lucrative pipeline routes in from Guatemala to Panama, are eager to increase their military capabilities and intelligence gathering capacities. The emergence of multiple non-state armed groups, often with significant ties to the formal political structure (state) through webs of judicial, legislative and administrative corruption, has some striking parallels to Colombia in the 1980 s, where multiple types of violence ultimately challenged the sovereignty of state and left a lasting legacy of embedded corruption within the nation’s political structure. Organized crime in El Salvador is now transnational in nature and more integrated into stronger, more versatile global networks such as the Mexican DTOs. It is a hybrid of both local crime – with gangs vying for control off specific geographic space so they can extract payment for the safe passage of illicit products – and transnational groups that need to use that space to successfully move their products. These symbiotic relationships are both complex and generally transient in nature but growing more consolidated and dangerous...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws from}} two {{different}} European projects: 1. 	The CO-Minor-IN/QUEST research project (JUST/ 2011 /JPEN/AG/ 2961, January 2013 – December 2014) focuses on the interactional dynamics of interpreter-mediated child interviews during the pre-trial phase of criminal procedures. ([URL]). 2. 	The JUSTISIGNS project (2013 - 2016) is a <b>transnational</b> education and <b>training</b> project co-funded under the European Commission’s Lifelong Learning programme. The project focuses on Deaf people’s access to justice and sign language interpreting in legal settings (www. justisigns. com). Interpreter-mediated Questioning of Minors (ImQM) involves communication with vulnerable interviewees, i. e. interviewees who need extra support for three main reasons: their age (i. e. under 18), native language and procedural status (either as a victim, witness or suspect). Through an online questionnaire distributed in the six EU member states of the project partners (Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), we questioned perceptions, needs and challenges in ImQM. Five groups of professionals were targeted: legal actors (justice and policing), psychologists, child support workers, spoken language interpreters and sign language interpreters. In {{the first part of}} this presentation, we discuss the responses from the latter group. How do the sign language interpreters see their role? How difficult or easy is it to apply their code of ethics (especially as compared to spoken language interpreters) ? What are the preferred seating arrangements in this complex situation where the child is accompanied by a social worker/guardian, and possibly also a psychologist? Which particular challenges are identified with regard to interpreting for deaf minors? Do spoken and sign language interpreters each have their own specific needs? Analysing the responses of sign language interpreters allows us to formulate recommendations for all participants in an interpreter-mediated interview with deaf minors, especially for the other professionals involved (legal actors, child support workers or psychologists) and to raise awareness about the specific challenges sign language interpreters are facing. Next, we present findings from the second part of the research project where we paid attention to particularly vulnerable interviewees and tried to define what “particularly vulnerable” means. The Directive 2012 / 29 /EU seems to suggest that victims with disabilities are to be considered extremely vulnerable. Are deaf children assumed to be included here? Within the framework of the Co-Minor project we worked with psychologists to identify additional factors that lead to increased vulnerability (ADHD, mental illnesses, etc.) A final issue we want to address is how to present this in a structured way and how participants in an ImQM may be supported to be able to recognize such factors. A suggestion here is to design protocols that participants can use in the form of a checklist. status: publishe...|$|R
