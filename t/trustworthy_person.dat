The Panic created financial difficulties for the company, and it floated bonds to stay alive. J. Edgar Thomson, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a mentor and close friend to many of the partners, bought many of these bonds in late 1873, helping keep the firm afloat. The partners dissolved Carnegie, McCandless & Co. {{to take advantage of a}} new Pennsylvania law permitting the formation of limited liability companies, and the Edgar Thomson Steel Company Ltd. was created on October 12, 1874. The company took its name from J. Edgar Thomson, who although not a large investor in the works had a superb reputation as an honest and <b>trustworthy</b> <b>person</b> (an important asset in risky financial times).|$|E

To solve this problem, coins were often left with a <b>trustworthy</b> <b>person,</b> and the merchant was given {{a slip of paper}} recording how much money he had with that person. If he showed the paper to that person he could regain his money. Eventually, the Song Dynasty paper money called [...] "jiaozi" [...] originated from these promissory notes.|$|E
2500|$|Mursal ( [...] meaning [...] "hurried"): if {{the narrator}} between the Successor and Muhammad is omitted from a given isnād, the hadith is mursal, e.g., when a Successor says, “The Prophet said ...” Since Sunnis {{believe in the}} uprightness of all Sahaba, they do not {{view it as a}} {{necessary}} problem if a Successor does not mention what Sahaba he received the hadith from. This means that if a hadith has an acceptable chain all the way to a Successor, and the successor attributes it to an unspecified companion, the isnād is considered acceptable. There are, however, different views in some cases: If the Successor is a young one and it is probable that he omitted an elder Successor who in turn reported from a companion. The opinion held by Imam Malik and all Maliki jurists is that the mursal of a <b>trustworthy</b> <b>person</b> is valid, just like a musnad hadith. This view has been developed to such an extreme that to some of them, the mursal is even better than the musnad, based on the following reasoning: [...] "The one who reports a musnad hadith leaves you with the names of the reporters for further investigation and scrutiny, whereas the one who narrates by way of irsal (the absence of the link between the successor and the Prophet), being a knowledgeable and <b>trustworthy</b> <b>person</b> himself, has already done so and found the hadith to be sound. In fact, he saves you from further research." [...] Others reject the mursal of a younger Successor.|$|E

2500|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, {{and was the}} first role cast. Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final {{appearance}} on Doctor Who. Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: [...] "We talked a lot about the role of a vicar in a community like that and {{what are the implications of}} the circumstances that the town is put in," [...] said Darvill, [...] "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young." [...] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and <b>trustworthy</b> <b>person.</b> Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect. Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set. [...] "Early on I knew it was going to be good because Chris said...veryone has to be nice and good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antonescu {{traveled}} to Germany and met Hitler on eight more occasions between June 1941 and August 1944. Such close contacts helped cement an enduring {{relationship between the}} two dictators, and Hitler reportedly came to see Antonescu as the only <b>trustworthy</b> <b>person</b> in Romania, and the only foreigner to consult on military matters. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that Hitler after first meeting Antonescu [...] "...was greatly impressed by him; no other leader Hitler met other than Mussolini ever received such consistently favorable comments from the German dictator. Hitler even mustered the patience to listen to Antonescu's lengthy disquisitions on the glorious history of Romania and the perfidy of the Hungarians-a curious reversal for a man who was more accustomed to regaling visitors with tirades of his own". In later statements, Hitler offered praise to Antonescu's [...] "breadth of vision" [...] and [...] "real personality." [...] A remarkable aspect of the Hitler-Antonescu friendship was neither could speak others' language. Hitler only knew German while the only foreign language Antonescu knew was French (in which he was completely fluent). During their meetings, Antonescu spoke in French which was then translated into German by Hitler's translator Paul Schmidt and vice versa (Schmidt did not speak Romanian). The German military presence increased significantly in early 1941, when, using Romania as a base, Hitler invaded the rebellious Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Greece (see Balkans Campaign). In parallel, Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom (at the time the only major adversary of Nazi Germany) aggravated into conflict: on February 10, 1941, British Premier Winston Churchill recalled His Majesty's Ambassador Reginald Hoare, and approved the blockade of Romanian ships in British-controlled ports. On 12 June 1941 during another summit with Hitler, Antonescu first learned of the [...] "special" [...] nature of Operation Barbarossa, namely that the war against the Soviet Union was to be an ideological war to [...] "annihilate" [...] the forces of [...] "Judo-Bolshevism", a [...] "war of extermination" [...] to be fought without any mercy and Hitler even showed Antonescu a copy of the [...] "Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia" [...] he had issued to his forces about the [...] "special treatment" [...] to be handed out to Soviet Jews. Antonescu completely accepted Hitler's ideas about Operation Barbarossa as a [...] "race war" [...] between the Aryans represented by the Nordic Germans and Latin Romanians on the Axis side vs. the Slavs and Asians commanded by the Jews on the Soviet side. Besides for anti-Semitism, there was an extremely strong current of anti-Slavic and anti-Asian racism to Antonescu's remarks about the [...] "Asiatic hordes" [...] of the Red Army. The Asians Antonescu referred were the various Asian peoples of the Soviet Union such as the Kazakhs, Kalmyks, Mongols, Uzbeks, Buriats, etc. During his summit with Hitler in June 1941, Antonescu told the Führer that he believed it was necessary to [...] "once and for all" [...] eliminate Russia as a power because the Russians was the most powerful Slavic nation and that as a Latin people, the Romanians had an inborn hatred of all Slavs and Jews. Antonescu went on to tell Hitler: [...] "Because of its racial qualities, Romania can continue to play its role as an anti-Slavic buffer for the benefit of Germany." [...] Ancel wrote that Romanian anti-Slavic racism differed from the German variety in that the Romanians had traditionally feared the Slavic peoples whereas the Germans had traditionally held the Slavic peoples in contempt. In Antonescu's mind, the Romanians as a Latin people had attained a level of civilization that the Slavs were nowhere as close to, but theoretically the Slavic Russians and Ukrainians might be able to reach under Romanian auspices, through Antonescu's remarks to Hitler that [...] "We must fight this race resolutely" [...] (i.e. the Slavs) together with the need for [...] "colonization" [...] of Transnistria suggested that he did think this would happen in his own lifetime. Subsequently, the Romanians assigned to Barbarossa were to learn that as a Latin people, the Germans considered them to be their inferiors, albeit not as inferior as the Slavs, Asians and Jews who were viewed as untermensch ("sub-humans"). Hitler's promise to Antonescu that after the war, the Germanic and Latin races would rule the world in a partnership turned out to be meaningless.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} process of partner choice and the {{specific}} role of geographical distance in this process. This focus on the spatial component is a unique and new approach to address the topic. By adopting a qualitative approach, the decision-making process preceding partner choice is captured, including the preferences people have for partners, the norms influencing partner choice, and the places people go to meet potential partners. In a Dutch village, focus groups were organised around the topic. The results show that place is crucial in partner choice. Partners from close by are preferred as that is convenient and as they are seen as <b>trustworthy</b> <b>persons.</b> Spatial perceptions of people and places, based on perceived local cultural differences, affect the distance at which partners are found. The rural setting of the study, including mostly less educated participants, revealed that opportunities and norms are more important in partner choice in such a case, whereas preferences play a minor role. Local cultural diversity, from diverse reformed denominations to spatial perceptions of the mentality of people in nearby communities, affects patterns of social interaction.

And if any of the laws thus determined appear to be inconsistent with the present circumstances or customs of trade, do not make a noise about them, nor try to enforce them suddenly on others, nor embroider them on flags, nor call meetings in parks about them, in spite of railings and police; but keep them in your thoughts and sight, as objects of patient purpose and future achievement by peaceful strength.|$|R
40|$|Background: Social {{capital has}} been {{described}} as a person’s sense of belonging as a result of the number and type of relationships she/he has, in which trust and reciprocity are especially important. Aim: To illuminate older persons’ experiences of social capital and depressive ill-health after implementation of the CCM. Methods: Data were collected from nine participants resident in two districts of Norway by means of individual in-depth interviews. A qualitative hermeneutic analysis was performed. Results: Two overall themes, desire for a guardian and a wish for independence despite being dependent, and two themes emerging from the analysis. The first theme—searching for protection was based on three sub-themes overwhelmed by the emotional pain of other people, a sense of exclusion and worries about the future, while the second theme—the need for a relationship with <b>trustworthy</b> <b>persons</b> comprised two sub-themes, namely, emotional pain was not understood and powerlessness to change the situation. The result of this study highlights the need for greater understanding on the part of healthcare professionals of how older persons manage their social relationships. Healthcare professionals require more knowledge about how negative self-beliefs held by older persons suffering from emotional pain, which can lead to reduced ability to trust other people. Another consequence is that fear of being dependent on other people can result in unwillingness to admit the need for help.
