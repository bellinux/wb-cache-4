A scientific study was done that measured the optimal distance apart from each finger when swimming {{in order to gain}} the most distance and force in the water. The study analyzed evolutionary advancement from the palms and feet of aquatic animals and reptiles and compared them to humans’ hands.

At DTM, he began extending his research efforts into questions concerning the origin of the terrestrial planets--Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. He was stimulated by earlier studies by Victor Safronov (O. Yu. Schmidt Institute, Moscow), who showed that as a swarm of planetesimals coagulated into large bodies the swarm could evolve to produce a few terrestrial planets. Wetherill developed a technique to calculate numerically the orbital evolution and accumulation of planetesimal swarms, and he used the <b>technique</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> specific predictions of the physical and orbital properties of terrestrial planets.

50|$|One {{point is}} deducted for every shot taken. Destroying a target {{in any way}} (by firing, with debris from helicopters, etc.) awards two points. Thus {{performing}} multiple hits with a single shot exploiting the debris is the main <b>technique</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> high scores; for example shooting at a single helicopter and also destroying with the debris another helicopter and a parachute will result in 2+2+2-1=5 points, instead of the 3 points that would be scored by killing each of the 3 items with a 'dedicated' shot.Sometime during game play paratroopers stop appearing and falling, letting the player fire at the helicopters with no further risks of being destroyed, and easily reach the maximum score of 1000 points; no known exploits had been found to generate this scenario consistently.|$|E

The method of Otsuka et al. 1976 is the most suitable for doing such deep investigations. The technique is simply to compute the gravity effect of various rock units, whose density and geometry are known, followed by the subtraction of these effects from the observed gravity (Otsuka and Ogawa 1977). Hence, the resultant data allow to map the regional anomalies and consequently more knowledge of the deep-seated constituents.|$|E
