40|$|Do phenothiazines {{contribute}} to tumour regressions in lymphokineactivated killer cell/interleukin- 2 treatments of renal cell cancer? Sir- Phenothiazines {{are known to}} exhibit antitumour activity (Belkin & Hardy, 1957). They are used routinely {{for the prevention of}} treatment-induced nausea in cancer patients not only during treatment with cytotoxic drugs but also during administration of lymphokine- activated killer (LAK) cells and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). With the LAK cell/IL- 2 treatment tumour regressions are mainly observed in renal cell cancer patients and melanoma patients (Rosenberg et al., 1985). The present experiments were performed to examine a possible cytostatic activity of phenothiazines on human renal cancer cells. Four commercially available phenothiazines were tested (Table I) on human renal cancer cells as recently described (Sauter & Cogoli, 1987). Growth inhibition was observed with all of the four phenothiazines examined at concentrations similar to that of nitrogen <b>mustard</b> (<b>Table</b> I). The maximal effect was reached between 20 and 40 h of drug:cell contact. Drug-cell contact as short as seven minutes already produced a definite growth inhibition (Figure 1). The phenothiazine concentrations necessary to cause growth inhibition of renal cancer cells in vitro are around 20 pM whereas plasma levels of chlorpromazine rarely exceed 0. 6 /M (Simpson et al., 1980). Despite this 30 -fold difference in concentrations an in vivo antitumour activity of phenothiazines is quite possible due to selective high concentrations in certain tumour tissues (Fairchild et al., 1982) : Interestingly enough LAK cell/IL- 2 treatments induce tumour regressions in melanomas (Rosenberg et al., 1985) where chlorpromazine is known to accumulate (Fairchild et al., 1982). If in renal cell cancers the same selective a Table I Growth inhibition (GI) of hypernephroma cells by four phenothiazines and nitrogen mustard (continuous exposure) Minimal concentration (#M) for: Drug complete GI detectable GI chlorpromazine (LargactilR...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{isolation}} of allyl isothiocyanate from {{the seeds of}} black mustard over a century ago, the occurrence of isothiocyanates in nature has frequently been reported. Organic isothiocyanates are commonly called mustard oils because of their long recognized distribution in plants of the mustard family, Cruciferae, which derived the name originally from the French condiment moustarde. Various of the mustards have been important items of commerce since ancient times. Mustard oils may be conveniently grouped as volatile and non-volatile. Volatile oils, such as allyl mustard oil, have a characteristically sharp taste and odor, whereas the non-volatile, such as p-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate (the active principle of <b>table</b> <b>mustard),</b> are odorless but also possess a sharp taste. Volatile mustard oils may be easily separated from the seed mixture by steam distillation, and consequently have been more extensively investigated than non-volatile mustard oils. The purpose of this investigation is to elucidate the chemical nature of the precursors of mustard oils in plants, the mustard oil glucosides...|$|E
