5000|$|Sack tapping is a slang {{term for}} a form of {{bullying}} practiced by some adolescents as a [...] "game" [...] where a male or female participant attacks, by slapping, <b>tapping,</b> <b>punching,</b> kicking, elbowing, twisting, or backhanding a male victim's testicles. The term derived from 'sack', slang that refers to the scrotum, and the activity {{is a form of}} groin attack. This sociological manifestation of bullying can result in severe testicular injury that may require amputation as the only form of treatment. A reported increased popularity of sack tapping, fueled in part by YouTube videos, and the subsequent increase in hospitalization has concerned parents and urologists. It is also called [...] "nut tag", [...] "bag tag", [...] "sack whack", [...] "bell flicking" [...] and [...] "roshambo", the last name coming from an episode of South Park that featured the practice.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{adapting}} a 9 - 0 cm X-ray camera isdescribed. Although scattering {{in the region}} 20 - 100;x cannot be called low angle scatter there are many clay mineral investigations in which dear recording of this region is required. We have found that 9 - 0 cm diameter powder cameras based {{on the design of}} the 19. 0 cm camera described by Bradley, Lipson, and Petch (194 I) can be modified to recorded spacings in this region. The cameras we normally use are modified as suggested by MacEwan (1949) and have a <b>punched</b> <b>slot</b> in the film with a locating peg instead of the more usual beam catcher. To eliminate air scatter at low angles the cameras are usually evacuated. For some investigations it is not desirable to evacuate the camera and in these cases a beam catcher is more useful. In this note a modification of the 9 " 0 cm camera is described which allows either a beam catcher or the <b>punched</b> <b>slot</b> method to be used with the same camera. The locating peg and the beam catcher are easily interchangeable and so also are beam catchers of different sizes. There is a fine adjustment which allows the beam catcher or the locating peg to be adjusted accurately and quickly. With a beam catcher 0. 5 mm wide, at a distance of 2 cm from the specimen, spacings up to 80. ~ can be dearly recorded with Co Kct radiation {{and there would be no}} great difficulty in extending this to somewhat lower angles. The short specimen to fihn distance, 4. 5 cm, and the facilities for evacua-tion which the camera already provides are further useful attributes. The beam is collimated by a double slit system both sets of which are adjustable. The first slit is on the film ring and the second slit is as near the specimen as possible. This arrangement combined with a foreshortened view of the focus gives narrow well-collimated beams. The beam catcher or the locating peg for the punched film are carried by a plate which rests on the top plate of the camera and which pivots about the conical specimen holder bearing. This plate has a fine adjustment and two locking screws. The beam catcher or locating peg is carried in a radial rectangular slot in the plate whic...|$|R

Next the Gambling Bug has two men are sitting at a bar bet five dollars ("five bucks") that a buzzing fly will land on one or another glass of beer first. Then a man who puts a coin in a casino slot machine. He watches the wheels spin around until three oranges appear. He jumps for joy until the payout from the machine is actually 3 oranges instead of the jackpot. He gets enraged and starts <b>punching</b> the <b>slot</b> machine.|$|R
5000|$|He was to face Shinya Aoki on May 29, 2011 in Japan for Dream but {{withdrew from}} the match. [...] Leading up to the fight, Mckee {{felt that he had}} already won mentally. [...] The pair {{eventually}} fought on at Dream 18 on December 31, 2012 and McKee lost via submission in the second round, immediately <b>tapping</b> after a <b>punch</b> from the grappling expert.|$|R
50|$|Slotted angle (also {{sometimes}} referred to as slotted angle iron) is a system of reusable metal strips used to construct shelving, frames, work benches, equipment stands and other structures. The name derives, first, from the use of elongated <b>slots</b> <b>punched</b> into the metal at uniform intervals to enable assembly of structures fixed with nuts and bolts, and second, from the longitudinal folding of the metal strips to form a right angle.|$|R
5000|$|Drill rod is {{tool steel}} round stock {{ground to a}} tight {{tolerance}} diameter; it is usually ±0.0005 in (±0.0127 mm). In the UK the name [...] "silver steel" [...] is often synonymous and sometimes hyponymous. Its origin was {{in reference to the}} shiny ground appearance (not to any silver alloying content). Drill rod diameters range from 0.0135 to 1.5 in; in the United States diameters smaller than th of an inch are made in letter drill sizes and number drill sizes, in addition to fractional sizes. Lengths are usually one or three feet (0.3 or 0.9 m). It is commonly used to make drill bits, <b>taps,</b> reamers, <b>punches,</b> dowel pins, and shafts. Note that the numbered sizes are different from the drill numbered sizes starting at 52. These sizes are: ...|$|R
5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own <b>tap</b> to <b>punch</b> holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|R
50|$|Several {{variations}} {{are available}} with different hole patterns for mounting to walls and supports. Solid channel has no holes predrilled, and must either be drilled on site or mounted in another fashion. Punched channel has round holes, large enough for 5/8 inch threaded steel rod or bolts, punched {{in the top of}} the channel at regular 1 7/8 inch centers. Half-slot channel has short, rounded end rectangular <b>slots</b> <b>punched</b> out on 2 inch centers. Slot channel has longer slots on 4 inch centers.|$|R
50|$|Shields faced Rousimar Palhares on August 1, 2015 at WSOF 22. He {{lost the}} fight by {{submission}} {{due to a}} kimura, marking his first loss by submission. This wasn't without controversy as Palhares repeatedly eye gouged Shields after several warnings from the ref, and again held the submission well after Jake <b>tapped,</b> and Shields <b>punched</b> Palhares in the face after the fight was over. Shields also followed with a kick which the referee blocked. Both Shields and Palhares were temporarily suspended by the NSAC after the fight.|$|R
5000|$|Costello {{continued}} to be a very influential gangster throughout the 1920s. Costello kept close associates Luciano, Lansky and Siegel involved in most of his gambling rackets, which included <b>punch</b> cards, <b>slot</b> machines, bookmaking and floating casinos. Costello eventually became known as the [...] "Prime Minister of the Underworld" [...] for his cultivation of associations and business relationships with New York's criminals, politicians, businessmen, judges, and police officials. As he followed the [...] "Big Three" [...] ideology of mixing crime, business and politics, Costello's underworld influence grew. His fellow gangsters considered Frank to be an important link between the Mafia and the politicians of Tammany Hall, New York's Democratic Party organization. This relationship gave Costello and his associates, including Luciano, the opportunity to buy the favors of politicians, judges, district attorneys, cops, city officials and anyone else they needed to bribe in order to freely run their criminal operations.|$|R
5000|$|Prefabricated {{panels are}} limited {{to the size of}} the {{substrate}} ranging from 2 x 4 ft to 4 x 10 ft. Fabric retained in a wall-mounted perimeter track system, is referred to as [...] "on-site acoustical wall panels". This is constructed by framing the perimeter track into shape, infilling the acoustical substrate and then stretching and tucking the fabric into the perimeter frame system. On-site wall panels can be constructed to accommodate door frames, baseboard, or any other intrusion. Large panels (generally, greater than 50 sq ft) can be created on walls and ceilings with this method. Wood finishes can consist of <b>punched</b> or routed <b>slots</b> and provide a natural look to the interior space, although acoustical absorption may not be great.|$|R
5000|$|What makes Motor Raid a more unique racing game, however, is {{the ability}} to engage in close-quarters combat in an effort to seize and {{maintain}} first place. The primary combat move, executed by pressing a [...] "punch" [...] button, is to swing a powerful weapon (such as a crescent sword or a [...] "smash-nail" [...] pike) around to knock down and slow opponents. The player can also hold down that button to sacrificially throw the weapon at an opponent to hit him/her at long range in an effort to take his/her weapon as a replacement, but if the player misses or gets attacked too many times, he/she will lose the weapon. In such situation, the player can <b>tap</b> the <b>punch</b> button to throw a punch for a fair chance to steal a weapon from a nearby opponent, or hold down the button to use a permanent secondary weapon, such as a claw or whip, for a certain chance to do so. Players can also press a [...] "kick" [...] button to hold off opponents that approach him/her from the behind to prevent them from attacking or overtaking him/her, but kicks are not powerful, as they do not result in knockouts.|$|R
500|$|The Mari Lwyd {{party would}} {{approach}} {{a house and}} sing a song in which they requested admittance. The inhabitants of the house would then offer excuses for why the team could not enter. The party would sing a second verse, and the debate {{between the two sides}} [...] known as the pwnco [...] would continue until the house's inhabitants ran out of ideas, at which time they were obliged to allow the party entry and to provide them with ale and food. An account from Nantgarw described such a performance, in which the Punch and Judy characters would cause a noise, with <b>Punch</b> <b>tapping</b> the ground to the rhythm of the music and rapping on the door with a poker, while Judy brushed the ground, house walls, and windows with a broom. The householders had to make Punch promise that he would not touch their fireplace before he entered the building, otherwise it was the local custom that before he left he would rake out the fire with his poker. In the case from Llangynwyd, however, there was no interplay between the householders and troupe, but rather the latter were typically granted entry automatically after singing the first verse of their song.|$|R
50|$|Drummer Ronnie Bedford was one {{of those}} excellent, but often {{seemingly}} invisible artists who form the backbone of jazz. Bedford was working at his trade since he was 16 in the 1940s, and has worked with and appeared on the albums of many of the top performers in jazz, both instrumental and vocal, comfortable in any number of jazz styles. He started early on the drums, taking lessons from Fred Albright of the NBC Orchestra when he was 10. Later he started listening to radio air checks of the great big bands on the radio which, among other things, resulted in Gene Krupa becoming his idol. Although he was already in jazz, the defining moment when he fully committed to the jazz life came in 1970 while he was with the Morris Nanton Trio. He went on to <b>punch</b> all the <b>slots</b> on the card: Broadway shows, big bands, small groups, TV, and the recording studio. A very short list of those he has sat in at drums are Hank Jones, Sylvia Sims, Arnett Cobb, Benny Carter, Walter Norris, and Bill Watrous. Bedford also performed at key jazz festivals and major concert halls, including the Newport Jazz Festival, Royal Albert Hall in London and New York's Avery Fisher Hall (both with Benny Goodman), and the Smithsonian Museum with Benny Carter.|$|R
40|$|There {{currently}} {{exists a}} broad range of applications for which the ability to produce an adherent, hard, wear and, corrosion-resistant coating plays a vital role. These applications include engine components, orthopedic devices, textile manufacturing components, hard disk media, optical coatings, and cutting and machining tools (e. g., <b>punches,</b> <b>taps,</b> scoring dies, and extrusion dies). Ion beam processing can {{play an important role in}} all of these technologies. Plasma source ion implantation (PSII) is an emerging technology which has the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional ion implantation by: (1) reducing the time and expense for implanting onto complex shapes and large areas and (2) extending the thickness of the modification zone through ion beam enhanced plasma growth of surface coatings. In PSII, targets are placed directly in a plasma source and then pulse biased to produce a non-line-of-sight process for complex-shaped targets without complex fixturing. If the pulse bias is a relatively high negative potential (20 to 100 kV) ion implantation will result. If however, a low voltage (50 [...] 1, 200 eV) high duty cycle pulse bias is applied, film deposition from the chamber gas will result, thereby increasing the extent of the surface modification into the 1 [...] 10 micron regime. To evaluate the potential for DLC to be used as a corrosion barrier, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and traditional electrochemistry techniques were used to investigate the breakdown mechanism in chloride and nonchloride containing environments. The effect of surface preparation on coating breakdown was also evaluated...|$|R
