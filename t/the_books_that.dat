5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> {{include the}} story of Lebrón are The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar (Lebrón's granddaughter), {{translated}} by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as A Message from God in the Atomic Age). The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E
5|$|Burgoyne's failed campaign, {{as may be}} seen by {{the titles}} of some of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> cover it in detail, marked a major turning point in the war. After the battle, he withdrew his men 10–15 miles north, near present-day Schuylerville, New York. General Burgoyne {{returned}} to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Several action figures, {{books and}} soundtracks were {{released}} by Square Enix. Among <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> were published were three Ultimania guidebooks, {{a series of}} artbooks/strategy guides published by Square Enix in Japan. They feature original artwork from Final Fantasy X-2, offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon {{many aspects of the}} game's storyline, and feature several interviews with the game's developers. There are three books in the series: Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania, Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania Ω, and Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission Ultimania. A similar three-book series was produced for Final Fantasy X.|$|E

5|$|The Humanist Library {{displays}} one of {{the oldest}} and most homogeneous collections of medieval manuscripts and Renaissance books in Europe. Its core is the still almost intact library of Beatus Rhenanus, which was bequeathed to the city and has been maintained by it ever since. The institution also holds <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> belonged to the Latin school of Sélestat, at which Rhenanus and many other reformers were educated around 1500. In 2011, the library has been inscribed in the Unesco's Memory of the World Register.|$|E
5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E

25|$|Some Christian groups, {{such as the}} Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches {{follow the}} Jewish {{practice}} of describing certain books as apocrypha (although these are not <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> the Hebrew Bible calls the Writings, nor do all churches regard the same list of books as apocryphal, see also biblical apocrypha).|$|E
25|$|The Synod of Hippo (in 393), {{followed}} by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), {{may be the first}} council that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> did not appear in the Hebrew Bible; the councils were under significant influence of Augustine of Hippo, who regarded the canon as already closed.|$|E
25|$|An oft-repeated urban legend {{holds that}} the library is sinking because when it was built, {{engineers}} failed {{to take into account}} the weight of all <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> would occupy the building.

25|$|The {{congregation}} thus {{placed on}} {{the conscience of the}} individual Christian the responsibility to avoid all writings dangerous to faith and morals, {{while at the same time}} abolishing the previously existing ecclesiastical law and the relative censures, without thereby declaring that <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> had once been listed in the various editions of the Index of Prohibited Books had become free of error and danger.|$|E

25|$|Building on the {{founding}} discoveries and theories {{in the history}} of quantum mechanics, the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of Walter Heitler and Fritz London in 1927. <b>The</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include Linus Pauling and E. Bright Wilson's 1935 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics – with Applications to Chemistry, Eyring, Walter and Kimball's 1944 Quantum Chemistry, Heitler's 1945 Elementary Wave Mechanics – with Applications to Quantum Chemistry, and later Coulson's 1952 textbook Valence, each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, {{it must be}} {{understood}} that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure {{to bring an end}} to Persepolis, Alexander is not by any means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the Sassanid era. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> <b>That</b> no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.|$|E
25|$|Also cut was {{the role}} of Miss Persimmon, played by Marjorie Eaton in the film. The bank chairman's father does not make an {{appearance}} like in the film, nor does Mr. Binnacle, Admiral Boom's assistant. New characters were developed {{to create a new}} conflict at the bank, the nice John Northbrook and scheming Herr Von Hussler. The park keeper from the books is in the musical but not the film. Another character from <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> is in the musical is Robertson Ay, the houseboy, who did not appear in the film. In the books, Jane and Michael have twin siblings, John and Barbara, and a baby sister Annabel, that do not appear in the stage or screen versions.|$|E
25|$|Although Ballard {{published}} several {{novels and}} short story collections throughout the seventies and eighties, his breakthrough {{into the mainstream}} came only with Empire of the Sun in 1984, based on his years in Shanghai and the Lunghua internment camp. It became a best-seller, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and awarded the Guardian Fiction Prize and James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. It made Ballard known to a wider audience, although <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>that</b> followed failed {{to achieve the same}} degree of success. Empire of the Sun was filmed by Steven Spielberg in 1987, starring a young Christian Bale as Jim (Ballard). Ballard himself appears briefly in the film, and he has described the experience of seeing his childhood memories reenacted and reinterpreted as bizarre.|$|E
