40|$|Many parents {{worry about}} {{when is the}} right time for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> start school. While some use <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> {{individual}} characteristics <b>to</b> judge school readiness, others have philosophical beliefs that lead them <b>to</b> delay <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> school entry.

30|$|Active consent (where parents gave written {{permission}} for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> participate) was requested from all parents, if any {{parents did not}} respond to this active consent approach up to two follow-up letters were mailed to parents requesting their passive consent where they were required to opt-out if they did not wish <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> participate (Ellickson & Hawes, 1989).

Although nepotism was generally frowned upon in China, Bo Yibo's ambitions for his son were well-known. Bo Yibo advanced the idea that revolutionary elders should 'nominate' <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> become high officials, and Bo Xilai was selected as his family's 'representative' over his older brother Bo Xicheng, ostensibly because of Xilai's superior academic credentials, which included attendance at the elite Peking University and a master's degree.|$|E

5|$|In 1974 most of River Oaks was {{assigned}} to River Oaks Elementary School. Prior to desegregation, it had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. In 1986 the neighborhood component of the school closed.

40|$|Replicating earlier research, a study {{examined}} parental expectations for <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Subjects, 88 parents approached {{as they were}} leaving the supermarket, were asked whether they thought <b>their</b> <b>children</b> would learn how to speak, listen, read, and write. Interviews were conducted by 21 preservice teachers who had collaborated {{in the development of}} the replication. Results indicated that, of the 88 parents interviewed, 80 expected <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> learn how to listen, 86 expected <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> learn how to write, 87 expected <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> learn how to speak, and 85 expected <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> learn how to read. However, many of the negative comments were given in a sarcastic tone, making it difficult to interpret the validity of the recorded response. The preservice teachers were administered an informal questionnaire. Results indicated that participation in the research process allowed them to interact with parents in a real situation and to discover that most parents have high expectations for <b>their</b> <b>children</b> learning. Results also indicated that the pr- ervice teachers gained knowledge of the processes involved with conducting research and enjoyed being involved. Further research will alter the order of interview questions, sites for conducting interviews, and the extent to which parents are informed of the purpose of the interviews.

5|$|An Assisted Elopement is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company.

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E

The five years of Primary education concludes with a Primary School Completion (PSC) Examination, the three years of Junior education concludes with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination, and next two years of Secondary education concludes with a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which culminate in a Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) Examination.
