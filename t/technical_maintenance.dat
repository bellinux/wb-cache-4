500|$|In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry {{investigated}} {{the crash of}} Sikorski's Liberator II AL523, {{but was unable to}} determine the probable cause, finding only that it was an accident and the [...] "aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established". A popular theory was insufficient <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> leading to jamming aircraft controls. Despite this finding, the political context of the event, coupled with a variety of curious circumstances, immediately gave rise to speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet, British or even Polish conspiracy.|$|E

40|$|Click on {{the link}} below {{to access the}} article (may not be free). This report {{contains}} the results from Phase I of a three phase research effort. Phase 1 examines aviation industry procedures for developing <b>maintenance</b> <b>technical</b> data. Phase 2 will document user problems with <b>maintenance</b> <b>technical</b> data. Phase 3 will identify <b>maintenance</b> <b>technical</b> data development improvements by applying human factors principles. Five aircraft manufacturers were surveyed regarding company policy, communication, data tracking, user feedback, and error reduction efforts. The five industry participants represent both regional and large commercial transport manufacturers. Phase 1 survey results revealed three significant <b>maintenance</b> <b>technical</b> data issues: inconsistent development process guidelines, reactive rather than proactive response to user feedback, and inadequate assessment of errors involving usability as opposed to accuracy. Phase 1 results will later be compared to Phase 2 surveys of user problems with <b>maintenance</b> <b>technical</b> data to identify the impact of development procedures on the users perception of manual quality...|$|R

From a patient workflow perspective, the room could be run by their surgical department and should rather be situated next to other surgical facilities, to ensure proper patient care and fast transportation.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} crash, Atlasjet's CEO Tuncay Doğaner assured {{in a press}} conference that [...] "the {{accident}} was caused by a pilot error, there was no technical fault with the aircraft". DGCA general manager Ali Arıduru shared Doğaner's opinion and declared that [...] "there was no problem with the <b>technical</b> <b>maintenance</b> of aircraft, it is evident that the aircraft crashed because of pilot error". These statements were widely criticized in the media and by experts since they were made {{at a time when it}} was impossible to know so quickly what happened without being able to properly assess the situation or know the facts.|$|E
