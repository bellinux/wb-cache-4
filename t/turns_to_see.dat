5|$|To {{the right}} of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right hand corner <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> flames {{reflected}} {{in the eyes of the}} daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.|$|E
5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E
25|$|At 12, Courtney {{built his}} first boat out of hemlock boards and two inch planks {{that he had}} found. Due to his poor {{workmanship}} he plastered yellow clay on his boat to keep it water-tight. Once on the water the clay would eventually be washed away. This did not stop him and his friends from racing the boat. They would take <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who row it the farthest before it sank.|$|E

60|$|A grief-stricken whisper caught Jim's ear. He <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Kate's wide, {{questioning}} {{eyes fixed}} upon him.|$|R

25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E
25|$|Her candle {{goes out}} in the draught and Rodolfo's candle goes out too; the pair stumble in the dark. Rodolfo, eager {{to spend time with}} the girl, to whom he is already attracted, finds the key and pockets it, feigning innocence. He takes her cold hand (Che gelida manina—"What a cold little hand") and tells her of his life as a poet, then asks her to tell him more about her life. The girl says her name is Mimì (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì—"Yes, they call me Mimì"), and {{describes}} her simple life as an embroiderer. Impatiently, the waiting friends call Rodolfo. He answers and <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mimì bathed in moonlight (duet, Rodolfo and Mimì: O soave fanciulla—"Oh lovely girl"). They realize that they have fallen in love. Rodolfo suggests remaining at home with Mimì, but she decides to accompany him to the Cafe Momus. As they leave, they sing of their newfound love.|$|E
2500|$|.....the {{bridge is}} the object which attracts the visitor before he has {{become aware of the}} Jonesian facade. He {{approaches}} the bridge and, from its steps, <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the facade. He passes through and across the bridge, turns again and becomes aware of the bridge, the river, the lawn and the façade as one picture in deep recession. He may imagine the portico; he will scarcely regret the curtailment. He may picture the formal knots, tortured hedges and statues of the 3rd. Earl's garden; he will be happier with the lawn. Standing here he may reflect upon the way in which a scene so classical, so deliberate, so complete, has been accomplished not by the decisions of one mind at one time but by a combination of accident, selection, genius and the tides of taste.|$|E
60|$|Fred <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a {{dozen of}} those who had been at work near him, {{advancing}} threateningly.|$|R

2500|$|Elsie arrives joyfully for {{her wedding}} {{to the man}} she still knows as [...] "Leonard", but the Lieutenant arrives and announces that her husband Fairfax lives. [...] Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught {{over the loss of}} [...] "Leonard", does not turn to see his face. [...] He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for another minute. [...] Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, [...] "Leonard", but he says that his heart is like a [...] "massive rock" [...] and claims her as his bride. [...] Finally Elsie <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his face, and finally {{recognises}} him as her adored one. [...] All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, The Merryman and his Maid, with wrenching sorrow. [...] Elsie [...] "drops a tear" [...] for Point, but turns back to her love. [...] As the chorus turns away to celebrate the marriage of Fairfax and Elsie, Point falls insensible at their feet.|$|E
2500|$|The first 16 {{episodes of}} the fifth series begin with Peel {{receiving}} a call-to-duty message from Steed: [...] "Mrs Peel, we're needed." [...] Peel was conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). The messages were delivered by Steed in increasingly bizarre ways as the series progressed: in a newspaper Peel had just bought, or on traffic lights while she was out driving. On one occasion Steed appeared on her television set, interrupting an old science-fiction movie (actually clips from the series four episode [...] "The Cybernauts") to call her to work. Another way Steed contacted her was {{in the beginning of}} episode 13, [...] "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station" [...] when she enters her flat and sees a Meccano Percy the Small Engine going around a circular track with a note on one of the train cars that says [...] "Mrs. Peel" [...] in bold letters, she then walks over to Steed who says, [...] "You're needed." [...] At the start of [...] "The Hidden Tiger" [...] Peel is redecorating her apartment (wearing a jumpsuit and drinking champagne); she peels off a strip of wallpaper, revealing the words [...] "Mrs Peel" [...] painted on the wall beneath. She <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Steed in the apartment removing another strip of wallpaper, revealing [...] "We're needed" [...] painted underneath on another wall. In another instance Emma enters Steed's flat to find he has just fallen down the stairs, and he painfully gasps, [...] "Mrs Peel, you're needed." [...] Often the episode's tag scene returned to the situation of the [...] "Mrs Peel, we're needed" [...] scene. [...] "The Hidden Tiger" [...] returns to the partially redecorated apartment where Steed begins painting a love heart and arrow and the initials of two people on the wall, but paints over the initials when Peel sees his graffito. In [...] "The Superlative Seven" [...] the call to duty and the tag both involve a duck shooting situation where unexpected items fall from the sky after shots are fired.|$|E
60|$|But Alice's {{attention}} is directed in another direction: {{to a little}} white object struggling in the clutches of a closed door {{at the back of}} the room. Steve <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what she is looking at, and at the same moment the door opens sufficiently to allow a pretty hand to obtrude, seize the kitten, or whatever it was, and softly reclose the door. For one second Alice did think it might be a kitten, but she knows now that it is part of a woman's dress. As for Steve thus suddenly acquainted with his recent visitor's whereabouts, his mouth opens wider than the door. He appeals mutely to Alice not to betray his strange secret to the Colonel.|$|E

50|$|The last scenes show {{both women}} in happier times, Del Rey <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> King and smiles; both women are seen pouting and glancing seductively over their {{shoulders}} towards one another. As the women embrace, the smoke in the atmosphere gathers and they disappear. It's shown, after both suicides, that a haunting image of Del Rey (presumably her ghost) is seen walking down a long road towards the camera.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} Antoine, the guide, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what {{detained}} the party, and instantly uttered a loud shout of alarm {{as he ran}} back to them.|$|R
