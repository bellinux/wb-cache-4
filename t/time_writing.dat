5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of <b>time,</b> <b>writing</b> that modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E

5|$|From 1816 until 1914, the {{fortress}} was converted {{from a military}} prison into a jail for debtors, criminals and political prisoners. In 1831, Russian lexicologist Vladimir Dal worked in the castle, at the <b>time</b> <b>writing</b> a dictionary of the Russian language. The castle {{was the center of}} the anti-feudalism movement in the Podolia during the 19th century led by the Patriotic War of 1812 cavalry veteran Ustym Karmaliuk (1787-1835), who is now regarded by Ukrainians as a national folk hero.|$|E

5|$|Back on Guam, Hubbard {{spent much}} of his <b>time</b> <b>writing</b> dozens of short stories and essays and failed the Naval Academy {{entrance}} examination. In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia, to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination. However, he was ruled out of consideration due to his near-sightedness. He was instead sent to Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. to qualify for admission to George Washington University. He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the university the following September.|$|E

Until his {{retirement}} from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. The document was never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. Seven Assignments recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It was not his first attempt at a book. In 1925 Clarke had found a publisher for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was never finished.|$|E

She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her <b>time</b> <b>writing</b> letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Poe plot, Riley was dismissed from the Democrat, so he returned to Greenfield to spend <b>time</b> <b>writing</b> poetry. Back home, he met Clara Louise Bottsford, a school teacher boarding in his father's home. They found they had much in common, particularly their love of literature. The couple began a twelve-year intermittent relationship which would be Riley's longest lasting. In mid-1878 the couple had their first breakup, caused partly by Riley's alcohol addiction. The event led Riley to make his first attempt to give up liquor. He joined a local temperance organization, but quit after a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Kneale had {{returned}} to writing for television with the BBC {{for the first time}} since Quatermass and the Pit when his play The Road was broadcast in September 1963. The play concerned the population of an 18th-century village who become haunted by visions of a future nuclear war, and was followed by several further one-off dramas for the BBC over the following decade, including two entries into BBC1's The Wednesday Play anthology strand. During this period he was regarded as one of the finest writers working for the BBC. Kneale did his first work for the ITV network during this <b>time,</b> <b>writing</b> one-off play The Crunch for the ATV company in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his <b>time</b> <b>writing</b> mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to find time to work on the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this <b>time.</b> <b>Writing</b> in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
