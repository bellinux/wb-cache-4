5|$|Barnes {{brought along}} half a tonne of baggage {{on the sea}} voyage to England, {{including}} {{a lot of food}} and drink, particularly alcohol, which was scarce due to the war and subject to rationing. There Barnes would sell his goods. During the journey, the players had to sign autographs on 5,000 sheets of paper with the team list. Barnes had a stamp of his signature made, and paid a young boy drinks to deal with <b>the</b> <b>sheets,</b> but he landed himself in trouble with captain Don Bradman and manager Keith Johnson when the boy stamped <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> erratically, sometimes not adjacent to Barnes's position on the team list.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's notes {{appear to}} have been {{intended}} for publication because many of <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> have a form and order that would facilitate this. In many cases a single topic, for example, the heart or the human fetus, is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet. Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{projection}} dome was {{separate from}} the outer dome, and was 23 meters (75.4ft) in diameter. Made of curved aluminum sheets, it was lap jointed to create a continuous spherical surface. <b>The</b> <b>sheets</b> were painted white and perforated with 2.5-millimeter (0.1inch) holes, which were designed to let sound through and reduced echoes in the cavernous space.|$|E
40|$|Unsteady 2 D sheet {{cavitation}} {{has been}} calculated by a BEM. Cubics {{are used to}} represent various quantities like the potential on the wet part of the profile, the normal velocity on <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>the</b> geometry of the profile and <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>The</b> growing cavity <b>sheet,</b> <b>the</b> re-entrant jet and <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> behaviour near <b>the</b> closure point have been calculated...|$|R
50|$|On small sailboats {{and some}} {{cruising}} sailboats a vang may be omitted. If a vang is not installed, then <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> has {{to try to}} control both horizontal and vertical angles of the boom. When the boom is near <b>the</b> centerline, <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is nearly vertical, and can exert downward force on the boom. As <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is loosened to increase the horizontal angle of the boom and sail, <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> becomes horizontal and exerts less downward force. A vang works with <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> to apply <b>the</b> downward force on the boom at all horizontal angles, allowing <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> {{to be used to}} control the horizontal angle of the boom effectively.|$|R
40|$|A haptic device using {{flexible}} sheet such as rubber {{has already}} been proposed. Controlling the bias tension of <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>the</b> device varies compliance of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> in <b>the</b> normal direction; users can feel compliance of various virtual objects if they touch <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> This device is integrated into a visual and haptic display. The haptic device uses transparent flexible sheet, and a liquid crystal display is placed under <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> If users touch <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> they feel compliance of virtual objects while seeing both their own hands directly {{and the image of}} the deformed objects through <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> In <b>the</b> present paper, this see-through sheet visual display is developed and evaluated...|$|R
5|$|After {{discovering}} that his creation is missing, Frank {{returns to the}} lab with Brad and Riff Raff, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, Dr. Everett Scott, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until {{the closing of the}} ice sheets, after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of <b>the</b> <b>sheets.</b> The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000YBP, and the ice sheets receded 12,000—6,000YBP. The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through the shrinking ice sheets to recolonize the northern part of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century due to eradication.|$|E
5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E
25|$|Turning <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> {{over to look}} at it from behind. Notice that if {{a picture}} is drawn on one side of <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> then after turning <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> over, we see the mirror image of the picture.|$|R
50|$|In wiping, {{the longest}} end of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is clamped, then the tool moves up and down, bending <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> around <b>the</b> bend profile. Though faster than folding, wiping {{has a higher}} risk of {{producing}} scratches or otherwise damaging <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> because <b>the</b> tool is moving over <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> surface. <b>The</b> risk increases if sharp angles are being produced. Wiping on press brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A magnet induces {{circular}} electric {{currents in}} a metal sheet moving past it. See the diagram at right. It shows a metal sheet (C) moving to the right under a stationary magnet. The magnetic field (B, green arrows) of the magnet's north pole N passes down through <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> Since <b>the</b> metal is moving, the magnetic flux through <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is changing. At the part of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> under <b>the</b> {{leading edge of the}} magnet (left side) the magnetic field through <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is increasing as it gets nearer the magnet, [...] From Faraday's law of induction, this creates a circular electric field in <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> in a counterclockwise direction around the magnetic field lines. This field induces a counterclockwise flow of electric current (I, red), in <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> This is <b>the</b> eddy current. At the trailing edge of the magnet (right side) the magnetic field through <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is decreasing, , inducing a second eddy current in a clockwise direction in <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|R
5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through <b>the</b> <b>sheets.</b> The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots. A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The {{first issue}} {{consisted}} of four values released on 20 February 1925; d, 1d, 2d and 6d. Typographed by the Government Printers in Dublin Castle on 'se' watermarked paper. <b>The</b> <b>sheets</b> were printed in larger sheets of 180 {{divided into three}} panes of 60 labels. The second issue had ten values: d, 1d, 1d, 2d, 3d, 5d, 6d, 8d, 10d and 1/-, and were printed on 'e' watermarked paper between 1940 and 1969. Other details are the same.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
40|$|We {{formulate}} a nonlinear continuum {{model of a}} graphene sheet supported by a flat rigid substrate. <b>The</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is parallel to the}} substrate and loaded on a pair of opposite edges. A typical cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is modeled as an elastica. We use elementary techniques from bifurcation theory to investigate how the buckling of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> depends on <b>the</b> boundary conditions, the composition of the substrate, and the length of <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> We also present numerical results that illustrate snap-buckling of <b>the</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|R
30|$|During {{moving the}} punch in <b>the</b> matrix, <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> feeders conduct <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> into <b>the</b> {{mouth of the}} channel matrix by {{controlling}} <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> velocity, and at this stage, the blank force is reached to its maximum value.|$|R
5000|$|Step one: fold <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal over itself. This {{creates the}} bent shape in <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal.|$|R
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (<b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} upon Hudhayfah's request Uthman obtained <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> of the Quran from Ḥafṣa and appointed a commission consisting of Zayd and three prominent Meccans, and instructed them to copy <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> into several volumes {{based on the}} dialect of Quraysh, the main tribe of Mecca.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are divided}} {{from each other}} either square to the map grid, or along the meridians and parallels. In the first case, <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> will all be the same size. In the second case, the sheet size will {{decrease}} towards the north (for a northern hemisphere map) or the south (for a southern hemisphere map).|$|E
30|$|Finite element (FE) {{simulations}} {{were applied}} to compare the strains on <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> surface and <b>the</b> interior of <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> If {{there is a good}} agreement between these strain fields, then a strain field measured on <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> surface can be used also as a measure of the strains within <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> This would increase the relevance of the surface strain measurements since most of the shearing is of bulk material.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> of ice on {{the cold}} surface reaches the desired thickness, <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is slid down onto a grid of wires, where <b>the</b> <b>sheet's</b> weight causes it to be broken into the desired shapes, after which it falls into a storage bin.|$|R
50|$|See {{the diagram}} at right. It shows a metal sheet (C) {{moving to the}} right under a magnet. The {{magnetic}} field (B, green arrows) of the magnets north pole N passes down through <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> Since <b>the</b> metal is moving, the magnetic flux through sheet is changing. At the part of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> under <b>the</b> {{leading edge of the}} magnet (left side) the magnetic field through <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is increasing as it gets nearer the magnet. From Faradays law of induction, this field induces a counterclockwise flow of electric current (I, red), in <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> This is <b>the</b> eddy current. In contrast, at the trailing edge of the magnet (right side) the magnetic field through <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> is decreasing, inducing a clockwise eddy current in <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|R

25|$|Each domain {{comprises}} two β-pleated sheets. <b>The</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are linked}} by a disulfide bridge and together form a roughly barrel-shaped structure {{known as a}} β-barrel.|$|E
25|$|Waterproof {{mattress}} pads {{are used}} {{in some cases to}} ease clean-up of bedwetting incidents, however they only protect the mattress, and <b>the</b> <b>sheets,</b> bedding or sleeping partner may be soiled.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the bowline is identical to that of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> bend, except <b>the</b> bowline forms a loop in one rope and <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> bend joins two ropes. Along with <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> bend and <b>the</b> clove hitch, the bowline is often {{considered one of the}} most essential knots.|$|R
50|$|In folding, {{clamping}} beams {{hold the}} longer side of <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>The</b> beam rises and folds <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> around a bend profile. The bend beam can move <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> up or down, permitting the fabricating of parts with {{positive and negative}} bend angles. The resulting bend angle {{is influenced by the}} folding angle of the beam, tool geometry, and material properties. Large sheets can be handled in this process, making the operation easily automated. There is little risk of surface damage to <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|R
30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> surface gets {{contact with}} the punch, the blank is {{involved}} to <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> and <b>the</b> initial force is applied.|$|R
25|$|Consecutively {{in order}} of appearance: <b>The</b> <b>sheets</b> are {{numbered}} consecutively as each is published. Thus, {{it is not possible}} to determine <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> neighbouring a particular sheet without a current sheet index. Nor is it always possible to indicate on a sheet's map surround the numbers of adjacent sheets, as the date of publication of forthcoming sheets (and therefore thei place in the numbering system) may not yet be known. This system is therefore suitable only for small maps, or those in an irregular sheet division (as in tourist maps published by the private sector), and is seldom now used for modern official map series. Example: Geological Atlas of Switzerland (1:25,000).|$|E
25|$|And {{like for}} the 30 & 60 lepta stamps, <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> were printed in {{typography}} on Bristol paper, by the company: J. Claye & Cie, 7, rue Saint Benoît, in Paris, on April 13 & 14, 1876.|$|E
