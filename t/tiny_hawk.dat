25|$|The {{sharp-shinned hawk}} (Accipiter striatus) {{is a small}} hawk, with males being the {{smallest}} hawks in the United States and Canada, but with the species averaging larger than some Neotropical species, such as <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk.</b> The taxonomy is far from resolved, with some authorities considering the southern taxa to represent three separate species: white-breasted hawk (A. chionogaster), plain-breasted hawk (A. ventralis), and rufous-thighed hawk (A. erythronemius). The American Ornithological Society keeps all four species conspecific.|$|E

50|$|Unlike most accipiters, the <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk's</b> tail {{is quite}} short; it is squared or notched at the tip. Its wings are medium-length, with pointed tips, and its legs and toes are long.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{subspecies}} of <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk,</b> {{separated by}} the northern Andes. The two differ most significantly in relative tail length; differences {{in size and}} color are small, and {{can be hard to}} distinguish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> (Accipiter superciliosus) {{is a small}} diurnal bird of prey {{found in}} or near forests, {{primarily}} humid, {{throughout much of the}} Neotropics. It is primarily a bird-eater, and is known to prey on hummingbirds.|$|E
50|$|The {{call of the}} <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> is a shrill, high-pitched, {{somewhat}} quavery {{series of}} 20 - 30 notes of uneven pitch. After an initial few accelerating notes, the call settles into a steady rhythm, variously transcribed as caucau-ca-ca-ca, keer-keer-keer or kree-ree-ree-ree.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiny</b> <b>hawks</b> are patchily {{distributed}} {{from eastern}} Nicaragua down to western Ecuador, northern Bolivia, northern Argentina, Paraguay and southern Brazil. They frequent humid and wet lowland forests (including second growth) and forested foothills from sea level to about 1800 meters (5900 ft), though most records come from elevations below 1000 m (3300 ft).|$|R

50|$|<b>Tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> is {{the only}} species of Accipiter yet studied which has a large procoracoid foramen. It also differs from the typical sparrowhawks in other respects of its anatomy and in its DNA sequence. Consequently, its old name Hieraspiza superciliosa may be more appropriate.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult male}} <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> is dark slaty gray above, with a mottled gray face, a paler gray supercilium, and a blackish crown and nape. The white underparts {{are covered with}} fine gray barring, except on the unmarked throat. The longish tail is dark with three paler gray bands. Adult females are similar, but browner above with buffier underparts and browner barring below.|$|E
50|$|Like all accipiters, the <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> feeds {{primarily}} on birds. It hunts hummingbirds and small passerines, typically darting {{out from a}} place of concealment to snatch them as they pass by, but also ambushing them when the smaller birds are perched. There {{is some evidence that}} it learns the regular perches of some hummingbirds and hunts for them there. Some individuals also hunt rodents.|$|E
5000|$|The band formed {{early in}} 2003 and played their first show in The Bakery {{warehouse}} in Olneyville, Rhode Island in May of that year. <b>Tiny</b> <b>Hawks</b> released their debut 8 song EP/12" [...] Fingers Become Bridges in 2005 on Corleone Records and Moganono Records. Their subsequent full-length People Without End {{was released in}} 2006. They disbanded when Gus started have medical issues that limited his drumming.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk's</b> {{breeding}} biology. Their breeding season may vary depending on their location; from Panama to Colombia, it apparently runs between February and June, while {{in the southern part of}} the range, it may range from October to January. They are known to build stick nests, at least sometimes in the canopy of tall trees. In Venezuela, there is a record of a pair nesting in an old black-collared hawk nest. Females lay one to three bluish-white eggs, faintly streaked and spotted with brown. Incubation and fledging periods are not known.|$|R

5000|$|Usually {{placed in}} the genus Accipiter, it is the sister species of the <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> ("A." [...] superciliosus). The latter is the only species in Accipiter yet studied which has a large procoracoid foramen. The collaris-superciliosus {{superspecies}} also differs from the typical sparrowhawks in other respects of its anatomy and as regards DNA sequence. Consequently, the old genus Hieraspiza may be more appropriate for them.|$|E

50|$|The <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> is aptly named; males {{measure a}} mere 20 cm, {{about the size}} of a starling, though females are {{slightly}} larger at 26.5 cm (10.5 in). It is one of the smallest true raptors in the world and is one of the smallest Accipiter species, though the little sparrowhawk of Africa is of similar or even smaller size. The birds range in weight from 75 to 120 g As with most raptors, there is considerable sexual dimorphism in size, with females measuring up to 25% longer and as much as 60% heavier than males.|$|E
5000|$|By 2015, genetic {{research}} showed {{that many of}} the kite genera are related to the honey-buzzards, and that the <b>tiny</b> bat <b>hawk</b> (Machaerhamphus [...] or Macheirhamphus) is actually related to the huge harpy eagles. Several of the large kites are related more closely to the Buteo hawks (buzzards) than to the group of [...] "true" [...] kites and sea-eagles.|$|R
5000|$|The next morning, {{a band of}} rabbits {{discover}} Tiny. Their {{opinions on}} him are mixed (most of them believe Tiny to be some form of monster), but {{the leader of the}} group-the ruffian of the family, J.C. (his real name is Jerald Cuthbert)-feels that he should be left to survive on his own; luckily, one of his sisters, Joanna, decides that they should help him. She quickly convinces her siblings to join up after putting the matter to a vote with the other rabbits- Rebecca (the eldest sister), Mimi (the sensitive one), Cody (the glutton), Marty (the cautious one) -and Tiny is welcomed into the family as a [...] "bunny-puppy". Tiny accepts, but on one condition- they must come back later to see if Angie came back. The bunnies agree and bring him back to their home following a musical number in which they introduce themselves. However, they teach him to act like a rabbit, such as hopping and keeping his ears up straight. J.C. is frustrated with Tiny because he doesn't act like a rabbit, but when J.C. is caught by a <b>hawk,</b> <b>Tiny</b> scares the <b>hawk</b> away by barking at it, causing it to fly away in a panic. Because of this, the family afterwards decides to accept Tiny as their brother, which makes the puppy very happy, although their parents are afraid at first.|$|R
50|$|On clear mornings (and {{occasionally}} in late afternoons), the <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk</b> will sometimes sun itself {{on a high}} open branch. Occasionally, pairs will sun together. Otherwise, this is a secretive species and easily overlooked. It generally hunts from a perch, located anywhere from the undergrowth to the canopy, though most often in the middle story. When hunting in low growth, it often flashes from one perch to another in rapid succession. It is a fast flier; instead of the typical flap-flap-glide cadence of the accipiters, it makes a few quick flaps and then briefly closes its wings before flapping again. Tiny hawks occasionally soar above the forest canopy.|$|E
50|$|The {{pearl kite}} is 20.3 - 23 cm {{in length and}} weighs 80 - 95 g. It is the {{smallest}} raptor in the Americas {{and one of the}} two smallest accipitrids in the world (besides the little sparrowhawk). The <b>tiny</b> <b>hawk,</b> another neotropical species, attains a slightly higher weight than the pearl kite. The adult has a black crown, upperparts, wing and tail, a rufous edged white collar, yellow forehead and cheeks, mainly white underparts, and yellow legs. Immature birds are similar to the adults but have white and chestnut tips to the back and wing feathers, a buff collar and some buff on the white underparts. In flight this species looks mainly black above and white below. The northern form G. s. leonae differs from the nominate G. s. swainsonii in that it has rufous flanks.|$|E
