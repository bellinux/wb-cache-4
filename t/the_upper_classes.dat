5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} {{it is not clear that}} this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E
5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|Most historians thus concur that chattel {{slaves were}} indeed {{used in the}} Greek {{city-state}} of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only among <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b> As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.|$|E
50|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>class</b> {{encompasses}} <b>the</b> top end of {{the income}} spectrum relative members of society as a whole. Since they have more wealth and privacy, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> has more personal autonomy {{than the rest of}} <b>the</b> population. <b>Upper</b> <b>class</b> values include higher education, and for the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth, the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks. Children of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> are typically schooled on how to manage this power and channel this privilege in different forms. It is in large part by accessing various edifices of information, associates, procedures and auspices that <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations. Usually, people of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> participate as partisans in elections and have more political power than those of lower classes due to their abundance of resources and influence.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> is {{generally}} {{contained within the}} richest one or {{two percent of the}} population.

5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often {{with a view of}} the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with the}} skills and {{inclination}} to write Welsh recipes, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> conformed to English styles and therefore would not have run their houses with traditional Welsh cuisine. Upper-class households would take on any English fashions, even adopting English names. The traditional cookery of Wales originates from the daily meals of peasant folk, unlike other cultures where meals often started in the kitchens of the gentry and would be adapted.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not make them feel very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E
2500|$|Members of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> {{control and}} own {{significant}} portions of corporate America and may exercise indirect power through {{the investment of}} capital. The high salaries {{and the potential for}} amassing great wealth through stock options have greatly increased the power and visibility of the [...] "corporate elite". There is disagreement over whether the [...] "nouveau riche" [...] should be included as members of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> or whether this term should exclusively be used for established families. Many sociologists and commentators make a distinction between <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> (in <b>the</b> sense of those in the families of inherited wealth) and the corporate elite. By implication, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> is held in lower regard (as inheritors of idle wealth) than the self-made millionaires in prestigious occupations.|$|R
40|$|The {{bullfight}} from horseback (rejoneo) {{has been}} consistently described as a pastime of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> Andalusian elite. This is hardly surprising, given that many notable rejoneadores (mounted bullfighters) {{have been associated with}} the agrarian elite and share features of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> identified in early ethnographies such as socio-political influence and land ownership. However, this paper questions the extent to which all rejoneadores articulate socio-economic determinants of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> To account for the diversity in socio-economic background and identity amongst rejoneadores, I turn to more postmodern approaches applying performativity to class (Wiseman-Trowse; Rottenberg). By considering the material and symbolic role of bullfighting horses, I also highlight the role of human–animal relations in class constructions and perceptions. I suggest that rejoneo can be usefully considered a performance of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> rather than necessarily a performance by <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> This case study demonstrates the need for researchers to be critical of “insider” constructions of class as well as “outsider” or academic assessments, and to pay equal attention to elite and popular forms...|$|R

5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many {{members of}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> {{played for the}} side {{throughout}} their first-class years. Among these were Prince Christian Victor of Schleswig-Holstein, {{the only member of}} the British Royal Family to have played first-class cricket. Members of the peerage also played for I Zingari, including Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley, Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock, Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke and George Harris, 4th Baron Harris. At least three players were Members of Parliament, chief among them Alfred Lyttelton and Edward Stanhope who were both members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Cecil Wilson, who appeared for the side twice, also served as an Anglican Bishop of Melanesia and Bishop of Bunbury.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{science of}} the Middle Ages had a {{considerable}} influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b> One's lifestyle—including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies—was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.|$|E

A life-sized waxwork of Lambert was displayed in London, where it became extremely popular. Daniel Lambert soon became a popular subject with cartoonists, who often depicted him as John Bull. He mixed well with <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> and on one occasion met King GeorgeIII. The King's and Lambert's reactions to this meeting are not recorded.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Philadelphia <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> {{engaged in}} fox hunting, race horse breeding, {{attending}} balls and lavishly entertaining in their townhouses or mansions. The elite also joined exclusive clubs {{such as the}} State in Schuylkill and the Philadelphia Union League. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> started with mansions in Old City, but through the 18th and 19th centuries <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> gradually moved west through Center City {{until the end of}} the 19th century when much of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> moved to large mansions along the Pennsylvania Main Line. The Philadelphia aristocracy lasted well into the 20th century but by the end of the century the old rich families were overwhelmed by the new rich. By the late 20th century, membership in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> was defined less by ancestry, and organizations such as the Union League began to accept limited numbers of Jews, Catholics, and African Americans.|$|R

5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil society values {{education}} highly, for its {{own sake}} {{as well as for the}} opportunities it provides. The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional gurukulam classes on verandahs (known as Thinnai Pallikoodam in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and Sanskrit to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b> The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to Dutch Reformed churches when they took over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{clamping}} down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, {{and the emergence of}} Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and it felt threatened by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to explore the thesis that Gatsby’s dream in the novel The Great Gatsby, is to climb the class ladder and {{become a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> while members of that class feel {{threatened}} by the nouveau riche and tries to shut him out. Class identity is the main theme of the essay. Gatsby comes from a humble background but he decides early in his life that he wants a different life for himself and his aspirations are similar to the concept of the American dream. This essay argues that his dream undergoes a transformation when he meets Daisy and it becomes more aimed at becoming a member of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> for which Daisy is a symbol. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> couple, Tom and Daisy, represent the old money going downhill, while Gatsby as a self-made man represents the new money that wants equal social status to that of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class...</b>|$|R

5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> and those who could afford to pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|Although William's main rivals were gone, {{he still}} faced rebellions over the {{following}} years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, {{the introduction of the}} Norman language as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, {{which may or may not}} have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1964 riot in Hama and other cities, the radicals were on the retreat and the Aflaqites regained control for a brief period. Bitar formed a new government which halted the nationalisation process, reaffirm respect for civil liberties and private property. However, these policy changes did not win sufficient support, and the population at large still opposed Ba'ath Party rule. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> continued to disinvest capital and smuggle capital out of the country, and the only foreseeable solution to this loss of capital was continuing with nationalisation. The party's left-wing argued that the bourgeoisie would never be won over unless they were given total control over the economy as they had before. It was this power struggle between the moderate Aflaqites who dominated the National Command of the Ba'ath Party and the radicals who dominated the Syrian Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party which led to the 1966 coup d'état.|$|E
