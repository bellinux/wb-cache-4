5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner,</b> hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner.</b> Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Janet gets pregnant, the {{officers}} are baited into chasing a reckless driver {{into an apartment}} complex, where they are ambushed by {{the same group of}} Latino gang members. They fight their way into an alley, where Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala desperately attends <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner,</b> the assassins arrive and shoot him several times in the back, killing him. Police backup eventually arrives and the gangsters are brutally slain after refusing to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Democratic {{governor}} Bill Ritter named Marostica, a Republican, to {{the post}} of {{executive director of the}} Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, replacing Don Elliman, who Ritter had tapped as Colorado's chief operating officer. Marostica resigned his House seat to take the position, and handed control of his development company <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> and son in order to avoid conflicts of interest, Marostica named opening Asian markets to Colorado exports as a priority for his time in the new position, in addition to encouraging new venture capital investment and retaining existing major employers despite the late-2000s recession. Marostica was replaced in the House by small business owner Brian DelGrosso, and on the legislature's Joint Budget Committee by the more conservative Rep. Kent Lambert.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2007, the {{operating}} rights to D.C. United {{were sold to}} D.C. United Holdings, a newly formed group venture that included real estate developer Victor MacFarlane, founder of MacFarlane Partners, and William H.C. Chang, chairman of Westlake International Group. Other investors included D.C. United president Kevin Payne and Blue Devil Development, headed by former Duke basketball players Brian Davis and Christian Laettner. In April 2009, Victor MacFarlane sold {{his share of the}} team <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> William Chang after two stadium proposals had fallen through. In October 2009, Chang also bought out Davis and Laettner to fully control the team. Chang {{is also one of the}} primary investors of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants. In July 2012, Erick Thohir and Jason Levien, minority owners of the Philadelphia 76ers National Basketball Association franchise, joined Chang as partners. Thohir and Levin stated their primary goals are to make United a global brand and build a soccer-specific stadium for the club.|$|E

60|$|He came, {{and in a}} {{very few}} minutes he had talked over Susanna. He brought her a little present,--a work-box,--which he had bought for her at Littlebath; and though the work-box itself did not {{altogether}} avail, it {{paved the way for}} civil words, which were more efficacious. On this occasion he talked more <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner's</b> daughter than <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner's</b> sister, and promised to tell her mamma how well she was looking, and that the air of Littlebath had brought roses to her cheeks.|$|R
5|$|Scully later {{runs into}} the author at a church. He admits sending Scully the pendant and {{discusses}} with her the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She leaves, visibly shaken. Scully meets Mulder and relays her most recent encounter with the writer to Mulder. Later, Padgett woos Scully into his apartment with more character revelations. Mulder bursts in and arrests him based on accurate descriptions of the case murders in his novel, which he secretly read after discovering it in the mail. While Padgett is in custody, Maggie is murdered {{in the same fashion}} as Kevin. This establishes a de facto alibi for the author. Lacking concrete and connective evidence to the murders, and hoping Padgett might lead them <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> in crime, Mulder releases Padgett from custody.|$|E
5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner.</b> Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner,</b> placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E

5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner,</b> Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, DiBiase {{signed a}} {{developmental}} deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and debuted in their training territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). He made his FCW debut on August 4 in a tag team match, {{in which he}} and Jake Hager defeated Keith Walker and Heath Miller. In October, DiBiase {{became a member of}} the Next Generation Hart Foundation faction alongside Harry Smith, TJ Wilson, Nattie Neidhart, and Teddy Hart. He quickly separated from the group, however, and gained Maryse as a valet. On December 18, 2007, DiBiase defeated TJ Wilson to win the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship in New Port Richey, Florida. DiBiase, however, was unable to defend it due to an injury sustained, so he awarded the championship <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> Heath Miller on January 19, 2008. As of March 2008, DiBiase had suffered from a multitude of injuries including sciatica, a fractured left knee, separated ribs, broken finger, and bone spurs in his elbow. Due to these injuries, DiBiase competed sporadically in FCW for the next few months, competing in both tag team and singles competition.|$|E
5|$|In the story-driven Scenario Campaign mode in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Tekken 6, Lars is made {{into the central}} character. After the infiltration of a Mishima Zaibatsu-run laboratory goes awry, {{and a number of}} Jack robots overwhelm Lars' rebel squadron, he loses his memory and begins to seek out his true purpose. Joined by a robot named Alisa Bosconovitch, Lars travels the world trying to find his own identity. Along the way, he meets a Tekken Force lieutenant who tries to enlist him to help the cause once more. Lars' memory is restored on encountering his father Heihachi Mishima at his compound, at which point he also rediscovers his purpose: to stop Jin. He resumes his role {{as the leader of the}} rebel Tekken Force army and infiltrates G Corporation, and eventually meets Mishima Zaibatsu himself and encounters his half-nephew, Jin. Before he can fight Jin at Zaibatsu headquarters, it is revealed that Alisa has been acting as Jin's surveillance unit and has been monitoring Lars' movements around the world. This results in Lars and Alisa becoming enemies. At this point, a warrior named Raven offers to accompany Lars, and together the two pursue Jin into the desert, where he intends to awaken the ancient beast Azazel. At Azazel's Temple, Raven and Lars defeat the newly-awoken Azazel, and encounter Alisa and Jin again. Lars disables Alisa and engages Jin in battle, in revenge for his treatment of Alisa. During the fight, Azazel reappears and Jin turns his attention to the monster. Jin destroys Azazel, seemingly at the cost of his own life. Lars then brings the disabled Alisa <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> and adoptive brother Lee Chaolan, who offers to restore her. After leaving Alisa with Lee, and parting company with Raven, Lars gets a call summoning him for a new mission. Lars' role in this game is also briefly shown in the manga Tekken Comic, and the novel Tekken: The Dark History of Mishima.|$|E

60|$|For {{it must be}} {{recorded}} that with all this young gentleman's simplicity and unselfishness, with all <b>his</b> loyal attitude <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners,</b> <b>his</b> FIRST thought {{at the moment he}} grasped the fact of his wealth was of a young lady. It was Kitty Carter, the daughter of the hotelkeeper at Boomville, who owned the claim that the partners had mutually coveted. That a pretty girl's face should flash upon him with his conviction that he was now a rich man meant perhaps no disloyalty <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>partners,</b> whom he would still have helped. But it occurred to him now, in his half-hurt, half-vengeful state, that they had often joked him about Kitty, and perhaps further confidence with them was debarred. And it was only due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> dignity that he should now see Kitty at once.|$|R
