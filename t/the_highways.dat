5|$|In late 1951 {{or early}} 1952, {{the last section}} of M-89 was paved, a segment south and east of Fennville in Allegan County. Just months later, <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> was realigned to run east from Fennville, rather than south to Pearl, to {{intersect}} M-40. From there it was rerouted to run concurrently into Allegan.|$|E
5|$|K-383 and US-36 {{intersect}} K-261, a spur serving Prairie Dog State Park, {{before reaching}} the city of Norton. <b>The</b> <b>highways</b> curve northeast and back east and pass through {{the northern part of}} the city as Holme Street, a four-lane undivided road. K-383 and US-36 intersect US-283 (State Street) north of the downtown area. <b>The</b> <b>highways</b> become a two-lane road again as they leave Norton. K-383 and US-36 cross over the Kyle Railroad and begin to parallel the railroad and Prairie Dog Creek. <b>The</b> <b>highways</b> meet the southern end of K-67, a spur serving the Norton Correctional Facility, before they diverge. US-36 continues east and K-383 heads northeast parallel to the Kyle Railroad through the hamlet of Calvert. The state highway meets the northern end of K-60 just before it crosses over the Kyle Railroad on the edge of the city of Almena. K-383 continues east parallel to the Nebraska Kansas Colorado Railway into Phillips County. After they pass through the city of Long Island, that railroad splits to the north into Nebraska. K-383 passes through the village of Woodruff shortly before it reaches its northern terminus at US-183 about one half-mile south of the Nebraska state line.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} relocations along {{what is now}} K-383 {{occurred}} in Norton. US-36 and US-83 originally entered the city along Washington Street, turned north onto First Avenue, and turned east onto Main Street. The highway followed Main Street {{out of town and}} along a road paralleling the railroad to the present highway. The first realignment was authorized in 1936 to eliminate several right-angle turns and several at-grade railroad crossings. East of the intersection of First and Main, US-36 and US-83 turned north onto State Street and followed the highway to Holme Street, where <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> joined the present course. By 1941, this change was deemed unsatisfactory due to the continued existence of right-angle turns and grade crossings. Shortly thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> were moved to their present course bypassing downtown Norton.|$|E
50|$|The Central West {{region is}} traversed by <b>the</b> Great Western <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Mid-Western <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Mitchell <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Newell <b>Highway</b> and <b>the</b> Castlereagh <b>Highway.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Far West {{region is}} traversed by <b>the</b> Barrier <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Silver City <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Mitchell <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Cobb <b>Highway</b> and <b>the</b> Sturt <b>Highway</b> and by <b>the</b> Sydney-Perth Railway.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>highway</b> {{south of}} Cairns will see {{sections}} of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> to <b>the</b> suburb of Edmonton become six lanes, with progressive dual-carriageway redevelopment of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> to Gordonvale.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} {{opening of the}} road in October 1999 took place without fanfare, being opened by <b>the</b> <b>Highways</b> Agency Chief Executive rather than a politician, with only journalists with passes being admitted to the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|After {{the river}} crossing, the highway enters Benzie County {{and runs through}} the Pere Marquette State Forest. South of Benzonia, M-115 runs {{concurrently}} with US31 into town. <b>The</b> <b>highways</b> separate {{in the center of}} town where M-115 turns westward to run along the south shore of Crystal Lake past Frankfort Dow Memorial Field, the local airport near Frankfort. M-115 follows Forest Avenue, and the highway designation ends at the intersection in town with M-22 near Betsie Lake.|$|E
5|$|After this interchange, {{the freeway}} bends in a southeastern {{direction}} and reaches its final exit, Exit 420. This exit is a cloverleaf interchange with US-69, {{which is also}} known as the 18th Street Expressway. At this interchange, US-69 turns east to overlap I-70, US-40, and US-24, and <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> continue east of Exit 420 toward Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E
50|$|It {{sits at the}} {{junction}} of several <b>highways</b> including <b>the</b> Castlereagh <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Moonie <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Carnarvon <b>Highway</b> and <b>the</b> Balonne <b>Highway.</b> <b>The</b> only crossing of the Balonne River is the Andrew Nixon Bridge on <b>the</b> Balonne <b>Highway.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> is also notorious for rockslides and rocks falling onto <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> <b>The</b> main cause is an {{engineering}} flaw, in that sections of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{have been built}} {{on the north side}} of the Pigeon River, where the rock strata foliate towards <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>highway</b> {{construction}} {{was started in}} 1964 and completed in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> consists of about 34 bridges with the longest bridge over the Kali Gandaki River in Ramdi. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> {{takes its name from}} Siddhartha Gautam (Gautama Buddha). <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> was funded by the government of India.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. {{national}} defenses, {{to support}} military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, across {{many parts of the}} United States. The wider, multi-lane highways allowed traffic to move at faster speeds, with few or no stoplights on the way. The wide-open spaces along <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.|$|E
5|$|As the Interstate was completed, <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> that it {{replaced}} {{were removed}} from the state highway system. In 1973, the SR84 designation was removed from the highway from Gila Bend to the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield. In 1977, the US80 designation was removed from this stretch in favor of I-8.|$|E
5|$|M-113 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that runs in Grand Traverse County from M-37 near Hannah to US Highway 131 (US131) in Walton Junction. The trunkline runs through farm fields and woodlands {{in a rural area}} of the county. It connects <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> at its termini with the village of Kingsley. First designated in November 1927, the highway was extended in 1940 by adding the southernmost section near Walton Junction which was originally part of US131.|$|E
50|$|The routing of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{remained}} unchanged for nearly sixty years. However, it was decommissioned entirely during the 1997 and 1998 highway transfers. On April 1, 1997, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> south of Aylmer {{was transferred to}} the jurisdiction of Elgin County, and <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> north of <b>the</b> <b>Highway</b> 401 interchange was transferred to Middlesex County.Eight months later, on January 1, 1998, the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{was transferred to the}} two counties.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>highway</b> route {{runs through}} {{exceedingly}} rugged and unstable terrain. Heavy rain from typhoons often dislodge soil and rocks onto <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> making sections of it impassable. As well, {{the area is}} prone to seismic activity which can have disastrous effects on <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> On September 21, 1999 the Jiji earthquake caused massive damage to <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> and cut <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> in multiple places between Guguan and Lishan.|$|R
5|$|The next {{stretch of}} State Route 664 {{is full of}} bends, and <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{continuously}} turns at a constant rate. At an intersection with another Honey Suckle Lane, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> starts its northwestern progression once again. This changes again when Tedrow Lane begins paralleling <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Now following a steady northeastern alignment, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> continues through <b>the</b> large patches of trees south of Haneyville. At Little Plum Run Road, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> turns onto a steady northward alignment. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> continues through <b>the</b> trees for a while, continuing northward {{on its way to}} Gallagher Township.|$|R
5|$|MD222 {{has three}} {{auxiliary}} routes that are {{maintained by the}} Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) and provide access to the authority's facilities around I-95's interchange with MD222 and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway toll plaza {{to the east of}} the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge. <b>The</b> <b>highways</b> were created as part of the reconstruction of MD 222's interchange with I-95 in 1993 and 1994.|$|E
5|$|On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was {{approved}} by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and the original route of US12 replaced <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> from the state line northeasterly to Detroit; US31 overlapped the highway between St. Joseph and Watervliet. The remainder of the future I-94 corridor was served by US25 between Detroit and Port Huron. The first span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Preparation {{work on the}} free-flow scheme {{started in}} April 2014. Concerns were raised about reliability, with a Highways Agency report {{predicting}} that it could lose up to Â£6m of unpaid charges per year. In September, <b>the</b> <b>Highways</b> Agency announced that the new scheme would start to operate {{at the end of}} November, though related works to remove barriers would continue until April 2015. Subsequently, the date for removal of the booths was confirmed as 30 November.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>highway</b> begins near Church Rock, {{a notable}} rock {{formation}} along U.S. Route 191 between Moab and Monticello. It runs past {{the ruins of}} the utopian religious community called Home of Truth, and through Photograph Gap. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> then descends Indian Canyon. Once exiting <b>the</b> canyon <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> passes by Newspaper Rock, directly off the shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> also passes by Six-Shooter Peak, a notable peak near the entrance to Canyonlands National Park. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> ends at Dugout Ranch just shy of the National Park boundary.|$|R
50|$|Seventeen {{miles east}} of Eudora, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> joins Route 13 for one mile (1.6 km), then turns east. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> {{continues}} east to US 65 where <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> ends.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>highway</b> {{passes through}} Custer State Park and Wind Cave National Park. The {{northern}} 14 mi of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{is also known}} as <b>the</b> Needles <b>Highway.</b> <b>The</b> Needles <b>Highway,</b> along with <b>the</b> US 16A concurrency, are also part of the Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway. Portions of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> are also a section of Custer State Park's Wildlife Loop.|$|R
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) publishes traffic {{data for}} <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> it maintains. On Lakeshore Drive in Ishpeming, MDOT stated that 5,857vehicles on average used the roadway daily in 2014. Along Division Street, traffic drops to 4,044vehicles before {{dropping}} further to 1,617vehicles along {{the section on}} Silver Street in Negaunee. Traffic increases along Jackson and Main streets to 4,340vehicles on an average day. Traffic is heaviest along Teal Lake Avenue, at 7,521vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{changed the}} {{routings}} and designations of <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> around Cooks, Thompson and Manistique in the mid-1930s. The agency rerouted US2 between Cooks and Mâ149 in Thompson, turning the old road back to county control. The section between Mâ149 and Mâ125 was redesignated {{as an extension}} of Mâ149 to Thompson, and Mâ125 was replaced by a further extension of Mâ149. The last change was to route US2 along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August 2, 1936.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in the 1850s as part of the Opeongo and Ottawa Colonization Road, {{providing}} access to Renfrew County for settlement in the Opeongo Hills. However, it did not become a provincial highway until 1956. Aside from the change in number of <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> {{at either end of the}} route, the route has remained the same since then.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{sections}} of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> that are built to freeway standards. These include an area near <b>the</b> <b>highway's</b> intersection with <b>the</b> Glenn <b>Highway</b> in Palmer and a stretch {{known as the}} Robert J. Mitchell Expressway in Fairbanks leading to <b>the</b> <b>highway's</b> junction with <b>the</b> Richardson <b>Highway</b> (AK 2).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>highway</b> {{begins at}} <b>the</b> {{intersection}} of PH 2 in Tamsui. After crossing through Tamsui River via Guandu Bridge, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> enters Bali before turning towards <b>the</b> coast. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> then {{runs along the}} coasts of northwestern Taiwan {{for the remainder of}} the route. After leaving Bali, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> passes Linkou and enters Taoyuan City. In Taoyuan <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> passes through <b>the</b> coastal districts of Luzhu, Dayuan, Guanyin, and Xinwu. The stretch in Dayuan is the crash site of China Airlines Flight 676. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> then enters Hsinchu County, passing through Xinfeng and Zhubei before ending at Hsinchu City. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> shares a concurrency with PH 61 in Xinfeng and runs parallel to the latter between Xinfeng and Hsinchu.|$|R
50|$|At Daly Waters, {{the route}} number changes from National Highway 1 to National <b>Highway</b> 87. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> then {{continues}} 673 km south passing <b>the</b> Roper <b>Highway,</b> <b>the</b> Carpentaria <b>Highway</b> and <b>the</b> Buchanan <b>Highway</b> to <b>the</b> Barkly <b>Highway</b> at Tennant Creek. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> continues 508 km south into Alice Springs passing <b>the</b> Plenty <b>Highway.</b> It {{passes through the}} Macdonnell Ranges and finally crosses the South Australia/Northern Territory border south of Kulgera.|$|R
5|$|Three {{divisions}} {{were established}} within the new council: Finance and General Purposes; Public Health, Buildings and Sewerage; and Highways. The council sought {{to save money}} from the outset; {{reducing the number of}} workmen employed on <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> from ten to seven and cancelling the cleaning of ditches beside the roads. The lowest-paid man working on the sewers was informed he would need to move within the district and take a pay cut from Â£1:6s to Â£1:3s or be made redundant. He accepted.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} Sussex County, Route 183 {{enters the}} community of Stanhope. At the intersection with Musconetcong Avenue, the highway turns to the northwest, leaving {{the shores of the}} lake. Route 183 continues through the residential developments in Stanhope, working its way into the mountains above the lake. At the intersection with Dell Road, Route 183 becomes intertwined with the interchange on U.S. Route 206 northbound, and <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> merge a short distance later in Stanhope.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{maintenance}} duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{tracks the}} volume of traffic on <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> it maintains. This number is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average traffic for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, the department measured a peak of 19,719vehicles daily on the stretch north of Tittabawasee Road. The section south of the US10 interchange had the lowest traffic level at 9,315vehicles AADT. Additionally, entire route of M-47 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
50|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> has had {{two other}} {{official}} names, the official names have never stuck. The first official name was <b>the</b> Miller <b>Highway,</b> {{in honor of the}} city council president who pushed for <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> On March 30, 1999, at the urging of Mayor Giuliani, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> was renamed for legendary New York Yankees player Joe DiMaggio, who had died three weeks earlier. Legislation to rename <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> had been introduced before DiMaggio died. Giuliani championed the name change because <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> would have been the approach to the proposed West Side Stadium at <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> and 32nd Street. DiMaggio lived on Manhattan's east side.|$|R
2500|$|SH-39 {{continues}} eastward, {{serving the}} Lexington prison and overlapping {{for less than}} a mile with SH-102. In the town of Asher, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> intersects SH-3W and SH-59 again. [...] later, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> meets SH-9A in Konawa. <b>The</b> <b>highway</b> ends [...] east of Konawa at US-377/SH-3E/SH-99. The mainline of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> becomes SH-56.|$|R
50|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>highway's</b> {{northern}} terminus was at <b>the</b> Trans-Canada <b>Highway</b> in Virden, {{making the}} original length of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> 104 km. <b>The</b> section of PTH 83 between <b>the</b> Trans-Canada <b>Highway</b> and Birtle was opened to traffic in 1954. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{was extended to}} Swan River, replacing Highway 31.|$|R
