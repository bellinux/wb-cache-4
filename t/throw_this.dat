25|$|After {{making his}} {{first-class}} umpiring {{debut in the}} 1982-83 season, Emerson was promoted to the National Umpires panel in 1993-94. He made his ODI debut in a match between Sri Lanka and the West Indies in Brisbane in January, 1996. He immediately became controversial, no-balling Muralitharan seven times, and continuing to do so even when he switched to bowling legbreaks, which are regarded as being impossible to <b>throw.</b> <b>This</b> led to Muralitharan being dropped by Sri Lanka {{for the rest of}} the tour, as he was unable to bowl without being called. Emerson continued to officiate in ODIs for the next three years, standing in nine more games, all in Australia, but it was his last game which overshadowed even the first.|$|E
25|$|If an {{offensive}} player, {{such as the}} centre forward, has possession of the ball {{in front of the}} goal, the defensive player tries to steal the ball or to keep the centre from shooting or passing. If the defender cannot achieve these aims, he may commit a foul intentionally. The hole set then is given a free throw but must pass off the ball to another offensive player, rather than making a direct shot at the goal. Defensive perimeter players may also intentionally cause a minor foul and then move toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free <b>throw.</b> <b>This</b> technique, called sloughing, allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the hole set and possibly steal the inbound pass. The referee may refrain from declaring a foul, if in his judgment this would give the advantage to the offender's team. This is known as the Advantage Rule.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Tony Sawicki, a trans man {{and another}} clone played by Maslany. The character was first imagined by Manson and Fawcett {{during the development}} of the show's first season; they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be [...] "very tied to the themes of our show about identity" [...] and would fit well with the previous season's themes of gender and sexuality. When they approached Maslany with the idea {{at the end of the}} first season, she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself. It took the show's creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine Tony's personality and wardrobe, the entire process taking six months. In preparation for the part, Maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks, although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before the episode was filmed. The new character was kept secret from most of the crew until scripts for the episode were distributed, and the show's hair and makeup department trialled different looks for Tony on Maslany's days off and weekends so that other members of the crew would not see her in Tony's costume. Tony's final look was created by Stephen Lynch, Sandy Sokolowski and Debra Hanson, in the show's makeup, hair and wardrobe departments, respectively. Manson, Fawcett and Maslany sought advice from GLAAD on how to best go about introducing a transgender character. In response to the perception that Tony's introduction had created [...] "a minefield of sexual politics", Fawcett said that that had not been the writers' intention; rather, their aim was to [...] "just <b>throw</b> <b>this</b> character in there and treat them like a normal human being like we would anyone else on the show".|$|E

500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} the pay-per-view, WWE {{announced}} on their official website that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing [...] "slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal". Heyman and McMahon clashed on the plane to the North Charleston Coliseum and after a producers' meeting, Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW's creative team after the altercation. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Lashley being booked to win the ECW Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked. This situation was cited by Punk in his controversial shoot promo in 2011, in which {{he referred to the}} idea as one in which [...] "Heyman saw something in [...] that nobody else wanted to admit." [...] In an early 2008 interview with The Sun, Heyman gave more details on how he would have booked the Extreme Elimination Chamber main-event, which included having Punk enter first and quickly eliminating Big Show via submission. According to the interview, McMahon nixed the idea, but Big Show liked the direction Heyman was heading, and was eager for the opportunity to [...] "make" [...] a rising star like Punk. He also stated that he kept going to McMahon {{on the night of the}} pay-per-view to say that [...] "The people are going to <b>throw</b> <b>this</b> back in our face". Upset at how the event turned out, Tommy Dreamer and Stevie Richards both asked after the event to be released from their contracts. Both requests were refused by McMahon and WWE's Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis.|$|E

[...] Still, Dennis Cass of Slate magazine has criticized the duo for resorting to the same sensationalism as their targets, stating in a review of the series, [...] "One of the unwritten rules for winning an argument against an inflammatory, irrational opponent is to calmly adhere to a loftier set of rhetorical standards.

2500|$|In Luo Guanzhong's {{historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Xing played {{a greater role}} in the events preceding the Battle of Xiapi in 198. Cao Xing and Gao Shun were sent by Lü Bu to defend Xiaopei (小沛) from Cao Cao's general Xiahou Dun. When the two armies met outside the city, Xiahou Dun duelled with Gao Shun for about 40 or 50 rounds before Gao retreated. While pursuing Gao Shun, Xiahou Dun was hit in the left eye by an arrow fired by Cao Xing. With a cry, Xiahou Dun pulled out the arrow along with his eyeball. He exclaimed, [...] "Essence of my father, blood of my mother, I cannot <b>throw</b> <b>this</b> away!" [...] He then swallowed his eyeball and charged towards Cao Xing and impaled the latter right in the face with his spear. Cao Xing fell off his horse and died.|$|E

After drinking yet another pint of whiskey, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating [...] "big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me". The bus was parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden. He took the bottle with him onto the beach and fell on his knees and said, [...] "Lord,... I'm gonna <b>throw</b> <b>this</b> bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you. I sailed it into the Pacific... I got up, I knew I had done the right thing." [...] Perkins and Cash, who had his own problems with drugs, then gave each other support to stay sober.|$|E
