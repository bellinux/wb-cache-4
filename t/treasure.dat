5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a <b>treasure</b> trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a <b>treasure</b> trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the <b>treasure,</b> with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the <b>treasure.</b> In November 1993, the <b>Treasure</b> Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the <b>treasure.</b> He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 <b>Treasure</b> Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{describing}} Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements {{acquired through}} witchcraft, mysticism or {{a deal with}} the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí's ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden <b>treasure</b> or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his <b>treasure</b> and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden <b>treasure</b> flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Other Spanish ports {{were also}} {{blockaded}} {{with the intention}} of limiting Spanish trade and movement and intercepting <b>treasure</b> convoys from the colonies of New Spain and South America. Vast quantities of gold, silver and valuable trade goods crossed the Atlantic in regular armed frigate convoys. To intercept and seize these shipments the Royal Navy dispatched their own frigates to patrol the Spanish coast. To encourage their sailors, the Royal Navy distributed prize money to the value of the ships and material captured and the seizure of a Spanish <b>treasure</b> fleet could yield spectacular amounts of money: particularly large sums had been captured during previous wars in 1656, 1744 and 1762, but during {{the first three years of}} conflict between Great Britain and Spain only one <b>treasure</b> convoy had been intercepted, near Cádiz at the Action of 26 April 1797, and on that occasion the <b>treasure</b> was smuggled ashore before the convoy was seized.|$|E
