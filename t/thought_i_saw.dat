2500|$|..... One {{morning as}} I was making my thanksgiving after Communion, {{a very strong}} {{distraction}} took hold of me. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a great plain full of people enveloped in thick fog. They were walking about like people who had lost their way {{and did not know}} which way to turn. Someone near me said: 'This is England'. I was just going to ask some questions, when I saw Pope Pius IX just like I have seen him in pictures. He was robed magnificently and carried in his hand a torch alive with flames. As he walked slowly towards that immense gathering of people, the leaping flames from the torch dispelled the fog, and the people stood in the splendour of the noonday sun. 'That torch', said the one beside me, 'is the Catholic Faith, which is going to light up England'".|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Burke did not {{condemn the}} French Revolution. In {{a letter of}} 9 August 1789, he wrote: [...] "England gazing with astonishment at a French {{struggle}} for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner". The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In {{a letter to his}} son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: [...] "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable". On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken [...] "as no more than the expression of doubt" [...] but he added: [...] "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom". In the same month he described France as [...] "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox: ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell was a {{close friend}} of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, Cornell and Wood {{recorded}} the song [...] "Island of Summer", which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album [...] "Melodies & Dreams", a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: [...] "I've always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn't deal well with Andy's death. After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would look out the window and I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him. It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It's facing the reality." [...] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter's demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cornell said; [...] "When Andy died, I couldn't listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reason— his lyrics often seem as though they can tell that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as {{a matter of life and}} death— if that's what you're feeling at the time, then that's what you're going to write. It's sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt's case, whatever he was thinking and whatever he was writing, there wasn't an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It's a stream of thought, it's a possibility— it's definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, either." ...|$|E
