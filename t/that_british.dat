5|$|A British mission led by Akers {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with that of the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured <b>that</b> <b>British</b> participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E

After calling at <b>that</b> <b>British</b> port on 9 December, American docked at Marseilles, before leaving for New York in the new year, arriving there on 9 February 1919. American was decommissioned and returned to American-Hawaiian on 4 March, and formally struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 May.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant decided <b>that</b> <b>British</b> help {{would benefit}} {{some areas of}} the project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E
5|$|By dawn on 20 April 1941, the Germans {{were well}} aware <b>that</b> <b>British</b> and Allied forces had begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece.

On Sunday 20 April — Hitler's 52nd birthday — the Luftwaffe mounted mass attacks against Allied shipping in Piraeus Harbour.|$|E

5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist frameworks for analysing society, for instance in developing the belief <b>that</b> <b>British</b> colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>British</b> screenwriter Rupert Walters {{was writing}} a movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress Jodie Foster. The project did not receive Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for a veto on any scenes to which she did not agree. Riefenstahl also wanted Sharon Stone to play her rather than Foster, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1915 the German naval command {{found out}} <b>that</b> <b>British</b> ships were {{conducting}} reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area. Admiral Ingenohl was initially reluctant {{to attempt to}} destroy these forces, because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while Von der Tann was in drydock for periodic maintenance. Konteradmiral (counter admiral) Richard Eckermann—the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet—insisted on the operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank.|$|E

A civilian eyewitness (the anonymous writer of A Brief Narrative of the Ravages of the British and Hessians at Princeton in 1776–1777) wrote <b>that</b> 24 <b>British</b> soldiers were found dead on the field. George Washington claimed <b>that</b> the <b>British</b> had more than 100 killed and 300 captured. William S.

5|$|Ireland was a net food exporter. The excess {{was shipped}} to Britain.

In the light of experience they chose to sail alone, relying on their neutral markings. German respect for that neutrality varied from friendly to tragic.|$|E
5|$|Market {{research}} had revealed {{that many of}} Concorde's existing business customers had their tickets purchased by their employers and thought {{that the cost of}} a journey on Concorde was higher than it actually was; thus ticket prices were progressively raised to match these perceptions.

5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown <b>that</b> <b>British</b> and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most of the blame for the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} proposed <b>that</b> <b>British</b> Lieutenant General Sir Charles Keightley {{be given}} command of a Commonwealth Corps for Operation Coronet, the proposed invasion of Honshu, the main island of Japan, but the Australian government {{had no intention}} of concurring with the appointment of an officer with no experience fighting the Japanese, and counter-proposed Morshead for the command. The war ended before the issue was resolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{histories of}} British and Irish castles were recorded, albeit {{in a somewhat}} fragmented fashion, by John Leland in the 16th century and, by the 19th century, historical analysis of castles had become popular. Victorian historians such as George Clark and John Parker concluded <b>that</b> <b>British</b> castles had been built {{for the purposes of}} military defence, but believed that their history was pre-Conquest – concluding that the mottes across the countryside had been built by either the Romans or Celts.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} addax is Addax nasomaculatus. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus Addax and family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable <b>that</b> <b>British</b> hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} most {{important}} result of the raid was the technical knowledge <b>that</b> <b>British</b> scientists gained.

This was confirmed during the interrogation of the captured German technician, who proved to be less well trained than his British counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} castles by historians and archaeologists {{developed}} considerably during the 20th century.
