The experimental design was randomized blocks with 4 replicates using the highly susceptible Camaro cultivar. Eleven different fungicide formulae and foliar fertilizers with low copper concentration were compared. <b>Tribasic</b> <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> (Cuproxat S. D.

Hydroxide sulphate (Poltiglia disperses), tribasic sulphate (Cuproxat liquido) and the Special Kopper were less effective. The action of the foliar dressings Kendal TE, Fertileader rame and Labicuper showed the most promising results. The only non-copper-based alternative product, grapefruit seed extract, or DF 100 V, proved to be ineffective. Some of the tested foliar sprays were thus as effective as some copper-based fungicides and released less copper into the environment...|$|E
40|$|Blight-MOP Late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans) is {{the most}} devastating fungal disease {{affecting}} organic (and conventional) potato production in the EU. It kills the foliage and usually results in losses of yield which can be very large when infection is severe and occurs early in the season. The disease may be transmitted to the tubers which become unmarketable and these can lead to complete deterioration of the stored crop if put into storage with healthy tubers. To a great extent, conventional production systems rely upon frequent applications of synthetic fungicides with different modes of action for late blight control, but this is seldom completely successful. However, in organic systems, the availability of chemical fungicides is currently restricted to those which are ‘considered to be traditional organic farming practices’: these include copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride (<b>tribasic),</b> <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> and cuprous oxide that have a protectant action and are reasonably effective. Their use is restricted by national legislation and organic certifying authorities and pressure has been mounting to withdraw them {{not only because of}} possible adverse effects on wildlife, the environment and human health but also their incompatibility with organic production principles. This led to a proposed ban on the use of copper fungicides for control of late blight in organic farming in the EU from March 2002 which had potentially serious implications for the potato crop. The resultant losses of yield and hence income in the absence of copper-based fungicide sprays were expected to threaten the economic viability of both organic potato enterprises and/or whole organic farming businesses {{in many areas of the}} EU in the medium to long term until effective, alternative methods are developed. In the meantime, two major approaches were adopted. One was to set a limit to the amount of copperbased fungicides permitted for application: until 31 December 2005, the maximum application was restricted to 8 kg of elemental copper/ha/year for annual crops, declining to 6 kg/ha/year from 1 January 2006 (but this could be changed at any time in the light of developments in viable alternatives or should there be proposals for withdrawal under the EC Review programme for existing active substances). Another was to promote further research to identify and develop effective alternative late blight control methods and strategies without the undesirable effects associated with copper-based fungicides. The Blight-MOP project – ‘Development of a systems approach for late Blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans) Management in EU Organic Production systems’ was initiated in March 2001 to achieve this aim and maintain yield and quality and hence commercial viability of organic potato crops without the use of copper fungicides. Such an approach involves integrated use of (i) resistant varieties (ii) existing agronomic strategies (iii) alternative treatments that can replace synthetic and copper-based fungicides (iv) use of existing blight forecasting systems to optimise control treatments and to maximise synergistic interactions between (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). The specific objectives were to: 1. Assess the socio-economic impact of late blight and ‘state-of-the-art’ blight management practices in EU organic potato production systems 2. Assess varietal performance in organic production systems in different EU regions and interactions with local blight populations 3. Develop within field diversification strategies to prevent/delay blight epidemics 4. Optimise agronomic strategies for the management of late blight 5. Develop alternative control treatments to copper-based fungicides that comply with organic farming standards 6. Evaluate novel application and formulation strategies for copper- free/alternative and copper-based late blight treatments 7. Integrate optimised resistance management, diversification, agronomic and alternative control treatment strategies into existing organic potato management systems. To pursue these objectives, experiments were conducted over 4 seasons from 2001 to 2004 under organic cropping system conditions in seven countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and United Kingdom) spanning a wide range of aerial, soil, production and marketing environments. The rate and severity of the late blight epidemics in 2001, 2002 and 2004 gave a rigorous test of the different components of the integrated management system which gave broadly similar effects in the three years. In 2003, the very hot, dry summer (and August in particular) severely restricted the disease making it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of treatments in some regions, but in others where infection did occur the general trends were similar to those observed in other years...|$|E

The total fecal collection method was used to calculate daily fecal copper excretion. All pigs were slaughtered and samples of tissue were collected from the central right liver lobe, left kidney cortex and left longissimus muscle at the 10 th rib. Copper excretion increased with increasing levels of dietary copper addition (p< 0. 01) and with {{the age of the}} pigs (p< 0. 01). Copper levels in muscle, kidney and liver were significantly (p< 0. 01) higher for pigs fed 250 ppm copper compared with pigs fed 0 or 125 ppm copper. In experiment two, 126 crossbred (Yorkshire x Landrace) barrows weighing 13. 061. 36 kg were used in a 3 x 3 factorial experiment in which the pigs were fed diets supplemented with 0, 125 or 250 ppm copper fed in the form of either copper sulfate, <b>copper</b> methionine or <b>tribasic</b> <b>copper</b> chloride for 24 days.

30|$|Increased {{recoveries}} {{of nickel}} was {{obtained in the}} BCL concentrator Selebi-Phikwe pentlandite–pyrrhotite–chalcopyrite ore flotation up to a maximum <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> dosage, above which depression was observed and recoveries fell below that for the condition without any copper addition. Nickel recovery with increasing <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> dosage therefore shows a maxima. A dosage range about this maxima dosage is the critical process parameter for successful activation of the ore with <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The depression at higher dosage is explicable based on predominance change of copper with increasing concentration in the pulp. However, this increased recovery is with a compromise that pyrrhotite must be recovered along with pentlandite, due to dissemination constraints. Despite chalcopyrite presence, pyrrhotite recovery still improved, as chalcopyrite recovery also increased marginally. Because response to <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> addition in flotation can vary from possible depression to activation in sulphide ores, it is notable in this ore that despite flotation constraints imposed by the mineralogy, activation with <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> to increase nickel recovery can still be achieved, but within the careful dosage range.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> on the {{flotation}} of Mt Keith pentlandite ores was studied. As Mt Keith operates separate size flotation circuits, e. g. slime (− 8 μm), fine (− 25 μm) and coarse (− 160 μm) circuits, tests were conducted on streams of different particle size distributions prepared {{with the use of}} cyclones. The flotation response with and without the addition of <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> was examined, first, on feed streams prepared by a laboratory grinding mill and cyclone and, second, on streams collected directly from the plant. It was found that <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> had an adverse effect on flotation performance when the flotation feeds were prepared in the laboratory. In the flotation of slime-fine fractions that combined slime and fine particles, the addition of <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> depressed nickel flotation while increasing gangue entrainment. In the flotation of coarse fractions, the addition of <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> depressed nickel flotation without affecting gangue entrainment.

To explain this discrepancy, pulp chemistries in the two different types of tests were compared.

In Marten van Heemskerck’s The Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist (NG 6508.1) (Fig.  6), mineral <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> is present mixed with varying proportions of lead white for the undermodelling of Saint John’s drapery, which has then been glazed with a deep green layer of verdigris.|$|R
40|$|Tea {{plantations}} of Southdown estate are {{deficient in}} nutrients such as Copper, Magnesium, and Zinc. This was shown by leaf analysis done in 2012 to mature tea in several tea gardens of Southdown estate. These nutrients {{have been given}} little attention in Zimbabwe tea fertilizer recommendations despite their continual removal from the tea fields during harvesting. A study was therefore conducted to assess the effect of Copper, Magnesium and Zinc foliar fertilizers on yield and quality of tea at Southdown estate, Chipinge in Zimbabwe. The experiment was laid in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The treatments were; no fertilizer application (control), <b>Copper</b> <b>sulphate,</b> Zinc oxide, Magnesium oxide and a combination of <b>Copper</b> <b>sulphate,</b> Magnesium oxide and Zinc oxide. The different foliar fertilizers affected yield (shoot weight and shoot density) significantly (P< 0. 05), <b>Copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> reduced the yield significantly, 27. 3 % lower than the control. Zinc oxide increased yield significantly, 23. 82 % higher than the control. Magnesium oxide {{did not have a}} significant effect on yield of tea. Tea quality parameters (brightness, briskness, colour of liquor, strength of liquor and milk take) were affected significantly (P< 0. 05) by the different foliar fertilizers. <b>Copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> gave the highest average score implying highest quality, whilst the control (no fertilizer application) gave the lowest total average score, thus the lowest yield. The different foliar fertilisers increased the quality of tea. Results from this study showed that application of <b>Copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> results in increase in quality but not in yield. Application Zinc oxide increases both yield and quality of tea. Application of Magnesium oxide results in increase in quality but not yield. Application of the combination of <b>Copper</b> <b>sulphate,</b> Magnesium oxide and Zinc oxide only improved quality but not yield of tea. There is need for further researches on the different concentrations of foliar fertilizers to determine the best concentration which improves both quality and yield of tea. There is also need to repeat the experiment for more than one season and also in different sites...|$|R

30|$|Copper {{and iron}} {{can be related}} to copperas, either to blue (<b>copper</b> <b>sulphate)</b> or green (iron sulphate), or a mixture of both [37]. When used as mordants, these salts darkened colours. While iron in {{particular}} reacted with tannins present in the dye plant, copper usually added as <b>copper</b> <b>sulphate</b> or <b>copper</b> acetate could change colours such as yellow to duller olive tones [32]. It is possible, too, that the copper or iron vats in which dyeing occurred influenced the mordanting process, or the water sources themselves.|$|R
