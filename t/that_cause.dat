5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E

50|$|The term disease causative agent usually {{refers to}} the {{biological}} pathogen <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> a disease, such as a virus, parasite, fungus, or bacterium. Technically, the term can also refer to a toxin or toxic chemical <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> illness.|$|R
5|$|Bog turtles {{may suffer}} from {{bacterial}} infections. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas are two genera of bacteria <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> pneumonia in individuals.

5|$|Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, volcanism) <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> mass extinctions {{of species}} that, until the event, were {{perfectly}} adapted to their environment, {{such as the}} dinosaurs. The dramatic reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.|$|E
5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> infection.|$|E

5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin {{and several}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs (including cyclophosphamide) cause dyspigmentation. Other groups of drugs <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> this problem include antimalarials, amiodarone, heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.|$|E

5|$|Several highly lethal viral {{pathogens}} {{are members}} of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> viral haemorrhagic fever, and include the Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 after an outbreak in Angola. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, there were 252 cases including 227 deaths.|$|E

S. pyogenes is the bacterial species <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It can also cause other infections.|$|R

5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
