2500|$|Macquarie Group economists {{estimated}} {{the energy crisis}} could reduce gross domestic product growth by 0.25 percentage points in the third quarter, as gas prices increased {{and the percentage of}} gas production allocated to export reduced. Natural gas sales were worth $5.2billion in the 2006/2007 financial year, and its five-year trend growth rate is 16.8%. Chief Macquarie economist Richard Gibbs said, [...] "WA supplies the lion's share of the gas exports. The effect on exports is that as {{there is a shortage of}} gas in the system, the capability to export will be diminished because the gas that there is will be directed towards domestic use... The gas exports have been pretty healthy. In the next couple of quarters that will be moderated dramatically if not stalled altogether. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> have an impact on the broader commodities side and the trade gap could widen".|$|E
