50|$|Eglinton is {{best remembered}} for the lavish, if ill-fated Eglinton Tournament, a medieval-style tournament {{organised}} in 1839 by the 13th Earl. The expense {{and extent of}} the preparations became news across Scotland, and the railway line was even opened in advance of its official opening to ferry guests to Eglinton. Although high summer, in typical Scottish style <b>torrential</b> rain <b>washed</b> the proceedings out, despite the participants, in full period dress, gamely attempting to participate in events such as jousting. Amongst the participants was Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (the future Emperor Napoléon III of the French).|$|R
50|$|Mail {{was carried}} from the start. From 1 August the French, Italian and MC Railways were coordinated {{so as to}} deliver mail a day earlier and book {{passengers}} right through but on 10 August a <b>torrential</b> storm <b>washed</b> away a length of road, leaving the rail suspended. Then {{on the night of}} 17/18 August the Arc flooded again and washed away the Pont de la Denise, partly because of spoil left by tunnel builders for the standard railway. Footbridges were used to allow passengers to walk over the breaks.|$|R
50|$|Finally, a {{music festival}} in Southeast Asia that's {{worthy of the}} name. A fantastic venue, a packed and up-for-it audience, and a lineup that mixed unimpeachable indie {{credibility}} with balls-out, dance-till-you-drop rock'n'roll euphoria, Laneway Singapore couldn't {{have asked for a}} better debut. Even the non-stop <b>torrential</b> rain couldn't <b>wash</b> the smile from my face.|$|R
50|$|Calabar Municipality has no waste {{treatment}} facilities.Human wastes and those from cottage industries are dumped in surface sites or into open drains.The <b>torrential</b> rains <b>wash</b> {{most of the}} wastes into the Calabar and Great Kwa Rivers.Urban pollution and oil exploration activity in the near shore area both threaten {{the ecology of the}} estuary, greatly reducing the numbers and diversity of the species that provide food for shrimps and fish.A 1999 study of fish caught in the Calabar and Kwa rivers and in the estuary showed levels of copper and hydrocarbons were above the World Health Organization permissible levels in all samples.Iron content was above permissible levels in 20% of samples.The rate of accumulation of hydrocarbons was greater in the wet seasons, probably because of higher levels of contaminated material washed from vehicle maintenance shops by the torrential rains.|$|R
25|$|Hutton returned, and England gave debuts to Peter Loader and Frank Tyson, who {{had been}} {{selected}} for the winter tour to Australia. Rain delayed the start and Pakistan were soon in trouble, falling to 51 for seven before Kardar and the tail effected a small recovery. Tyson and Loader took seven wickets between them. <b>Torrential</b> rain <b>washed</b> out the second day, and when England batted on the Saturday the pitch helped the Pakistani medium-fast bowlers, Fazal Mahmood and Mahmood Hussain, who took six and four wickets respectively. Every batsman was caught. For a second time, Pakistan were rescued by the tail, which doubled the score from 82 for eight to 164, with Wazir Mohammad making an unbeaten 43. Johnny Wardle took seven for 56 but lacked support. When Reg Simpson, Peter May and Denis Compton took England to 109 for two, an England victory looked a formality, but lower-order timidity against Fazal, who took a further six wickets to finish with 12 for 99 in the match, brought a famous victory after only 55 minutes on the fifth day.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{mission of}} the Union was to {{participate}} in the 24th annual Black Ship Festival at Shimoda, Japan. This festival commemorates the arrival in Shimoda of Commodore Perry and his squadron of [...] "Black Ships" [...] in 1854. Having brought good will to Shimoda, Union next steamed to Sasebo for upkeep, then on to Pusan, Korea, where she provided facilities for Korean units to stage a ship-to-shore movement. June arrived with Union underway for Naha, Okinawa, to embark marines for the upcoming Operation [...] "Flagpole" [...] at Kuryongpo, Korea. Typhoon [...] "Shirley" [...] greatly hampered the landing phase of the operation, but it was finally completed despite <b>torrential</b> rains, floods, <b>washed</b> out roads, and dense fog.|$|R

5000|$|Eglinton is {{best known}} for a lavish, if ill-fated medieval tournament, {{organised}} by the 13th Earl. It opened on Friday, 30 August 1839 and it is said that the grand folly of the Eglinton Tournament, sprang directly from the disappointment of the so-called [...] "penny coronation". The Government had decided to scale down the pomp of Victoria's Coronation; one role abolished was that of the Queen's Champion and his ritual challenge in full armour. This role would have fallen to the Knight Marshal of the Royal Household, Sir Charles Lamb of Beaufort, the stepfather of the 13th Earl of Eglinton. The expense and extent of the preparations became news across Scotland, and the railway line was even opened in advance of its official opening to ferry guests to Eglinton. Although high summer, <b>torrential</b> rain <b>washed</b> the proceedings out. The tenantry of the Earl were provided with accommodation to view the proceedings. [...] The participants, in full medieval dress or armour, gamely attempting to participate in events such as jousting, held at what is now the Eglinton Loch. Amongst the participants was the future Napoleon III of France.|$|R
50|$|Passing just to {{the west}} of Japan, Sanba caused {{extensive}} losses to agriculture, forestry, and fishing industries on the islands of Okinawa Prefecture. Further inland on Kōchi and Gifu Prefectures, heavy rains damaged agricultural regions and washed out numerous roads. Losses on both prefectures totalled to ¥1.55 billion (US$1.98 million). Upon its landfall on the Korean Peninsula on September 17, it became the first time in 50 years that the peninsula had been struck by at least four typhoons in a single year. In South Korea, <b>torrential</b> rainfall also <b>washed</b> out road systems and inundated crop land, as well as damaged infrastructure. Losses there associated with Sanba totaled to ₩389 billion (US$347.5 million). In North Korea, the heavy precipitation worsened preexisting flood conditions initially started by Tropical Storm Khanun two months prior. Overall, throughout the typhoon's nine-day trek, Sanba caused US$378.8 million in losses and killed six people.|$|R
40|$|For {{developing}} nations, {{soil erosion}} {{is among the}} most chronic environmental and economic burdens. Many of these nations are in the tropics where, in just a few hours, <b>torrential</b> downpours can <b>wash</b> away tons of topsoil. Many others are in the drier zones where swirling winds and flash floods can be equally devastating. By these processes, huge amounts of valuable soil are being lost every day. Worse the soil accumulates in rivers, reservoirs, harbours and estuaries causing siltation and further costly devastation. Erosion is thus a double disaster: a vital resource disappears from where it is desperately needed only to be dumped where it is equally unwanted. One practical solution for controlling erosion simply, cheaply and on a huge scale in both the tropics and semi-arid regions could be the use of a coarse grass called vetiver (Vetiver zizanioides). Planted in lines along the contours of sloping lands, vetiver quickly forms narrow but very dense hedges. Its stiff foliage then blocks the passage of soil and debris It also slows any runoff and gives the rainfall a better chance of soaking into soil instead of rushing off the slope. The report Vetiver grass is a scientific audit of the safety and effectiveness of the plant as used for erosion control. The book reviews existing research and experiences with the grass. It has been produced particularly for nonspecialist readers such as government ministers, research directors, university students and NGOs. A word of warning to those thinking of introducing vetiver grass into new environments: the erosion-control form of the plant produces no viable seed, and therefore does not spread and become a weed. It must be propogated vegetatively. There is another form of vetiver which does produce viable seed and which can become a 'colonizer'; this type should never be used to control erosion.

40|$|The Mapocho basin (Central de Chile) {{is divided}} into two morphotectonic styles by the Mapocho fracture. ln the {{northern}} section, of the Santiago depression an intense monoclinal warping anda deep alveolar excavation evidence important uplift of the western border. ln the southern section, the asymetry is stronger than the former one and inverse, giving a fault angle depression. This fracturation of the depression's bottom has affected both the conditions of sedimentation and the drainage patterns, causing antecedence phenomena and antagonistic effects between tectodynamics and external morphogenesis. Concerning present tectonics and seismicity, the presence both of different tectonic compartments and depositional landforms in the depression, is possibly more important than the faults themselves in the explanation of the distribution of seismic intensities. ln the northern section of the depression there is a characteristic combination between alluvial cones and "glacis" (bahadas). Moreover, marshy terraces correspond to bad drainage conditions. ln the southern section, in exchange, the central compartments are occupied by proximal cones and dista 1 terraces.
