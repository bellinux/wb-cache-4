5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a <b>typology</b> <b>of</b> deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is a prefixing language, which, in {{the context}} of <b>typology</b> <b>of</b> Australian languages, may refer to its genealogical {{classification}} as well as its syntactic properties. Wagiman, along with other Gunwinyguan languages, inflects verbs for person and number of the subject obligatorily, and optionally for the object. In this respect Wagiman displays characteristics of a head-marking language. However, Wagiman also behaves as a dependent-marking language, in that nominals are case marked as to their grammatical or semantic roles, such as ergative (the subject of a transitive clause) or absolutive (the object of a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT — In this work, {{classical}} {{as well as}} probabilistic hierarchical clustering {{models are}} used to look for <b>typologies</b> <b>of</b> variables in classical data, <b>typologies</b> <b>of</b> groups of individuals in a classical three-way data table, and <b>typologies</b> <b>of</b> groups of individuals in a symbolic data table. The data are issued from a questionnaire on business area in order to evaluate the quality and satisfaction with the services provided to customers by an automobile company. The Ascendant Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (AHCA) is based, respectively, on the basic affinity coefficient and on extensions of this coefficient for the cases of a classical three-way data table and a symbolic data table, obtained from the weighted generalized affinity coefficient. The probabilistic aggregation criteria used, under the probabilistic approach named VL methodology (V for Validity, L for Linkage), resort essentially to probabilistic notions for {{the definition of the}} comparative functions. The validation of the obtained partitions is based on the global statistics of levels (STAT) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{theatrical}} mask, expressing {{an acting}} role, was supposedly first invented in the West by the Greek actor Thespis of Attica (6th century BC) and the Greek Aristotelian philosopher Theophrastus (circa 371–287 BC) {{is credited with}} being {{the first in the}} West to define human character in terms of a <b>typology</b> <b>of</b> personal strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, Marx's idea of character masks appears to have originated in his doctoral studies of Greek philosophy in 1837–39.

25|$|The <b>typology</b> <b>of</b> scarabs {{similar to}} the Sinis {{specimen}} began to be produced during the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt, then continuing in the New Kingdom, especially during the Twentieth dynasty (ca. 1187-1064 BC). The specific design of the Mont'e Prama seal is almost identical to a scarab found at the Samarian site of Tell Farah or at the Palestinian site of Tall al-Ajjul, the latter often identified as Sharuhen, the last Hyksos stronghold. However the most recent scarab belonging to this typology– although quite different in the design– {{had been found in}} Tyre and dated to the 8th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{contributed a}} {{substantial}} amount to the Hippocratic understanding of pathology. Under Hippocrates' bodily humors theory, differences in human moods come {{as a consequence of}} imbalances in one of the four bodily fluids: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the <b>typology</b> <b>of</b> human temperaments. In Galen's view, an imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (blood—sanguine, black bile—melancholic, yellow bile—choleric, and phlegm—phlegmatic). Thus, individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social; choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate; and phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the supply chain organization of Appellation of Origin wines, identify the <b>typologies</b> <b>of</b> economic agents and characterize their strategic behaviour, in order to identify the link between product range choices, procurement strategies and <b>typologies</b> <b>of</b> vertical relationship along the production, processing and bottling stages. The aim is to identify the possible strategic options for the valorization of Appellations of Origin on the final market. We first provide a descriptive analysis of the wine bottling stage, by distinguishing bottlers according to the types of vertical relationship with upstream production and processing stages. Afterwards, we describe bottlers’ structural characteristics and strategic decisions concerning product range and procurement strategies. Then, a cluster analysis is conducted, in order to identify <b>typologies</b> <b>of</b> bottlers, according to structural and organizational characteristics and strategic decision. On the basis of the clusters identified, a description of the possible strategic options for the valorization of Appellations of Origin is then provided. ...|$|R

25|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} of this most successful Attic vase painting style is the mastery of perspective foreshortening, allowing a much more naturalistic depiction of figures and actions. Another characteristic is the drastic reduction of figures per vessel, of anatomic details, and of ornamental decorations. In contrast, the repertoire of depicted scenes was increased. For example, the myths surrounding Theseus became very popular at this time. New or modified vase shapes were frequently employed, including the Nolan amphora (see <b>Typology</b> <b>of</b> Greek Vase Shapes), lekythoi, as well as bowls of the askos and dinos types. The specialisation into separate vase and bowl painters increased.|$|E
25|$|III. Rheme, dicisign, {{argument}} (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome, {{and regarded}} as very broadened {{versions of the}} traditional term, proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating <b>typology</b> <b>of</b> the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.|$|E
25|$|Boas {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} opponents of the then popular ideologies of scientific racism, the idea that race is a biological concept and that human behavior is best understood through the <b>typology</b> <b>of</b> biological characteristics. In a series of groundbreaking studies of skeletal anatomy he showed that cranial shape and size was highly malleable depending on environmental factors such as health and nutrition, in contrast to the claims by racial anthropologists of the day that held head shape to be a stable racial trait. Boas also worked to demonstrate that differences in human behavior are not primarily determined by innate biological dispositions, but are largely the result of cultural differences acquired through social learning. In this way, Boas introduced culture as the primary concept for describing differences in behavior between human groups, and as the central analytical concept of anthropology.|$|E
