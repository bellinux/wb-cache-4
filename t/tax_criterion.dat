For 30 years, the democracies said that they were ineffectual in coordinating economic life, and markets were perfect for this political role. The report provides a corrective to the attendant policies based on these views, by using the Tobin tax, a proposal once again in the news, as an illustration. Through an interpretation of the ideal and less than ideal relations between governments and the financial sector, it assesses the Tobin <b>tax.</b> <b>Criteria</b> about its feasibility and desirability are drawn from this broader framework about the purposes of banks and their role in society.

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the capital}} income taxation of foreign-source income, where residence and source criteria {{are the two}} well-known <b>tax</b> <b>criteria.</b> The study presents a globally optimal tax rule which equalizes the shadow price of capital in the countries and which {{is assumed to be}} a weighted average of the return on savings and on investment, i. e. depending on the gross rate of return to the extent that capital contributes to the capital used, and on the net interest rate to the extent that capital displaces savings. Correspondingly, international taxation is a weighted average of domestic and foreign capital income tax rates. The weight depends on savings and investment behaviour, and also on the taxation of pure rents and on the income distribution effects of the tax scheme in the considered overlapping-generations model. The study also considers foreign direct investment an the investment incentives created by the 1993 Capital Income Tax Reform in Finland to foreign direct investment to Finland. Since the home countries of most foreign multinational enterprises apply the territorial principle, the lower capital income tax rate has real positive effects on new capital investment from abroad.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the ATO’s debt collection framework, including the number of debt collection strategies that the ATO has developed, giving {{particular attention to the}} position of a corporate tax debtor that is approaching insolvency within the ATO’s debt collection framework. In the context of a tax debtor that is approaching insolvency, it is evident that {{the manner in which the}} ATO administers the tax law has the potential to impact on the corporate tax debtor, as well as a number of other stakeholders. In the current economic climate, the ATO is most concerned about mitigating the risk to the revenue of non‑compliance and, more broadly, carefully managing its approach to debt collection to contain debt levels at acceptable limits. An analysis is made as to whether the ATO’s administrative practices are achieving the recognised <b>tax</b> policy <b>criteria</b> of fiscal adequacy, efficiency, equity and simplicity. This analysis highlights areas of weakness within the current ATO’s debt collection framework and the international experience is drawn on to discuss possibilities for future action. In order to successfully achieve the recognised <b>tax</b> policy <b>criteria,</b> a few themes will emerge in this article. These themes include the importance of early intervention, the early mandatory assessment of business viability, tax debtor engagement with the ATO and of striking the right balance of flexible delivery while fostering a positive compliance culture when administering the tax law.

40|$|In the United States, {{generally}} all {{interest payments}} are deductible. In Canada, by contrast, only interest that is incurred {{for a business}} purpose is deductible. In both countries, however, the deduction for interest paid on debts connected with the acquisition of a personal asset is commonly analyzed and defended {{as if it were}} a tax expenditure. Thus, in the United States the 2 ̆ 2 Deductibility of Mortgage Interest on Owner-Occupied Homes 2 ̆ 2 (which constitutes about 60 per cent of all deductions for interest paid) and the 2 ̆ 2 Deductibility of Interest on Consumer Credit 2 ̆ 2 are included in all published tax expenditure lists. In Canada, the recent debate over whether residential mortgage interest should be deductible, see 1 Canadian Taxation (No. 3) 23 - 29 (1979) and 1 Canadian Taxation (No. 1) 38 (1979), has been carried on almost exclusively in tax expenditure terms. The proposed deduction has been defended and analyzed as a housing measure and as a measure to stimulate the economy. In this article, Professor Gunn argues that the deduction for interest on personal debt is not a tax expenditure but instead is a proper deduction in a normative income tax base. He thus justifies a deduction for personal interest by reference solely to <b>tax</b> <b>criteria</b> (as opposed to expenditure criteria).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{interfaces}} and integration between tax strategy and corporate {{strategy in the}} foreign direct investment (FDI) decision process of UK multinational firms. Drawing on the prior literature, it aims to develop a better understanding of: (i) the role of tax in the FDI decision making process; (ii) the stages at which tax issues are considered in the decision making; and (iii) the processes by which the FDI strategic decisions are made. Data were collected {{by means of a}} web- based survey using Survey Monkey. The FAME database served to provide the main sampling frame for the data collection. A total of 192 usable responses were obtained for data analysis. The relevance of taxation in the FDI strategic decision process has not generally been addressed in UK academic literature, so {{little is known about the}} processes by and stages at which FDI decisions vis-a-vis taxation are made. It is clear from the data analysis undertaken, for example, that tax is not a driving factor in strategic decisions, but one of many factors considered, and that multinationals do not take decisions based on <b>tax</b> <b>criteria</b> alone. The thesis can thus refute, for instance, popular perceptions that multinationals' behaviour makes exploitative use of tax avoidance schemes and devices, which is typically not supported by empirical evidence. The research findings suggest that tax strategy is part of corporate strategy in the FDI decision process. The findings show that tax incentives are not an important motive for FDI compared with other business-oriented motives, which play more important roles in the FDI decision making process. The study's findings add topical and original elements to the development of academic literature in this area and are also of practical significance. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{corporate}} tax system {{within the context}} of the historical bias and current effects of the current system of taxation of corporations and shareholders. Drawing on public finance theory, financial markets microstructure research, and perspectives on corporate governance, Professor Rudnick proposes a profits tax on the liquid equity of firms. She finds this to be a normative rationale for a double tax system under optimal tax principles due to the inelasticity of demand for and supply of liquidity and the economic rent it produces. The value of liquidity in different capital markets is the crucial determinate. Under traditional <b>tax</b> policy <b>criteria</b> of horizontal and vertical equity and efficiency, this approach correctly classifies those firms that can normatively be included in a double tax system after an interest return on equity is deducted. Drawing the line at liquidity allows the fullest expansion of passthrough regimes such as Subchapter S and partnership taxation as well as other forms of integration...|$|R

The policy discourse can offer new perspectives on the old question of the choice between source and residence taxation, makes it possible to understand them in terms of <b>tax</b> fairness <b>criteria,</b> and gives rise to a new criterion: the participation principle.

40|$|Excerpt] Employee {{stock options}} are {{contracts}} giving employees {{the right to}} buy the company’s common stock at a specified exercise price, at a specified time or during a specified period, and after a specified vesting period. The value of the option when granted lies in the prospect that the market price of the company’s stock will increase by the time the option is exercised (used to purchase stock). At the grant date for the options, rather than selecting an exercise price based on the current market price for the stock, officials at some companies have selected a prior date with a lower market price; that is, they backdated stock options to an earlier grant date. If this backdating occurred without public disclosure, the recipient of the stock options received increased compensation in violation of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, generally accepted accounting rules, and tax laws. Some backdating is said to involve “sloppiness,” not fraud. The backdating of stock options has imposed costs on shareholders, employees, bondholders, and taxpayers. A corporate official who has profited from undisclosed backdating of stock options may not be responsible or even knowledgeable of the backdating. “Nonqualified” stock options, which have no special <b>tax</b> <b>criteria</b> to meet, are the focus of the backdating controversy primarily because they can be granted in unlimited amounts. The magnitude of stock option grants grew dramatically in the 1990 s, subsequent to passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, a stock market boom, and revised accounting rules. Recent corporate disclosure changes have reduced the opportunities and rewards for backdating stock options. Empirical studies about backdating have been done by academics and investigative journalists. Four recent regulatory actions may have reduced the backdating of stock options, but problems persist. On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new rules requiring companies to subtract the expense of options from their earnings. After August 29, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required that companies notify the SEC within two business days after granting stock options. In 2003, the SEC required increased disclosure of stock option plans. The SEC issued enhanced option grant disclosure rules effective December 15, 2006. Policy options to further reduce backdating and other timing manipulation include changes in SEC regulations and a change in the tax law. The SEC, various state prosecutorial, and Department of Justice (DOJ) probes into backdating abuses are ongoing. In addition, many firms have mounted their own internal probes into possible abuses. By November 2007, the SEC’s investigation caseload had fallen from a peak of 160 to about 80, and the SEC had brought civil enforcement actions against seven companies and 26 former executives associated with 15 firms. And according to reports from the DOJ, there were at least 10 criminal filings against defendants for backdating. As of January 2, 2008, the only CEO to be convicted of charges related to backdating was Greg Reyes, former Brocade CEO. This report will be updated as issues develop or new legislation is introduced...|$|R

40|$|Although tax {{simplification}} {{enjoys the}} attractiveness of being the opposite of complexity, it can have untoward effects {{as illustrated by the}} examples of a capitation tax, an international income tax regime that lacks rigorous base protection measures, and a system of negotiated tax liabilities. Moreover, complexity is not a problem for most taxpayers because most either benefit from complexity and have the capacity to deal with it or have simple compliance burdens. Small business taxpayers are the principal exception to this observation and tax system reformers need to develop simplification measures for those taxpayers without creating truck holes to be exploited by others. At the end of the day, simplification is only one of several <b>tax</b> policy <b>criteria</b> that {{must be taken into account}} in a balancing process. Tax expenditure analysis is often a helpful tool in this regard but it should not be viewed as a device for attacking tax expenditures solely because they add complexity to the tax law. On the other hand complex tax expenditures that have humanitarian objectives should not be sheltered from tax expenditure analysis solely because of their humanitarian ends. This point is illustrated by examples. Finally, we must accept that complex economies demand correspondingly complex tax regimes, and that the complexity will inevitably reside somewhere in the legal system where it will have to be endured. We most certainly should pursue the goal of tax system simplification but in doing so, we must thoughtfully balance simplification objectives against tax base preservation, tax burden distribution concerns, efficiency concerns, administrability, and political realities. The creation of institutional structures that ensure that simplification always receives appropriate consideration in this process would clearly constitute an important contribution. Compromise will, however, be the inevitable result. Consequently we should not have unrealistic expectations regarding the amount of simplification that can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Past {{studies on}} hybrid power cycles using {{multiple}} heat sources of different temperatures focused mainly on case studies {{and almost no}} general theory about this type of systems has been developed. This dissertation is a study of their general thermodynamic performance, with comparisons to their corresponding single heat source reference systems. The method used in the dissertation was step-wise: to first analyze the major hybrid power cycles (e. g. Rankine, Brayton, Combined Cycles, and their main variants) thermodynamically, without involving specific operation parameter values, and develop some generalized theory that is at least applicable to each type of system. The second step was to look for commonalities among these theories and develop the sought generalized theory based on these commonalities. A number of simulation case studies were performed to help the understanding and confirm the thermodynamic results. Exergo-economic analysis was also performed to complement the thermodynamic analysis with consideration of externalities, and was compared to the conventional economic analysis method. The generalized expressions for the energy/exergy efficiency differences between the hybrid and the corresponding single heat source systems were developed. The {{results showed that the}} energy and exergy efficiencies of the hybrid systems are higher than those of their corresponding single heat source reference systems if and only if the energy/exergy conversion efficiency (defined in the dissertation) of the additional heat source (AHS, can be any heat source that has lower temperature) is larger than that of the original heat source. Sensitivity analysis results showed the relations between the temperature and heat addition rate of the AHS and the energy/exergy efficiency of the hybrid systems. Other big advantages of hybrid systems, i. e. the effects on replacement of fossil fuel by renewable, nuclear and waste energy, lower emissions and depletion of fossil fuel, were revealed in the economic analysis, by considering the cost reduction from fuel saving and carbon <b>tax.</b> Simple <b>criteria</b> were developed to help compare the hybrid and reference systems and determine under which conditions the hybrid systems will have better thermodynamic or economic performance than the reference ones. The results and criteria can be used to help design the hybrid systems to achieve higher energy and/or exergy efficiencies and/or lower levelized electricity cost (LEC) before detailed design or simulation or experiment. So far, 3 archival journal papers and 3 conference papers were published from this dissertation work. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{has created a}} major concern in developedcountries for control of social risks with negative effects on growth and this problem can be approached {{from the perspective of}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Thus, CSR is seen as an entrepreneurial attitude aimed at promoting social, economic and environmental purposes while guarantying competitiveness in the international market. Thus, social economy can contribute to sustainable development, economic and social cohesion, to promote productive and income distribution, to ensure employment and equality of opportunities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to have an influence onthe role that taxation plays in the area of incentive policies related to social economy and very prominently manifested in the legal status of cooperatives. The approach aims to provide proposals on tax regulation of cooperatives taking the perspective of the international context and the size of the sector in countries like Spain and Peru in order to encourage cooperative social responsibility. Indeed, the importance of providing a legal and fiscal framework to promote their internationalization connects providentially with the principles that govern the cooperative action. We consider that it is essential, from the perspective of sustainable development and cooperatives’social responsibility, to take into account in the <b>tax</b> regime applicable <b>criteria</b> that can be justified on constitutional principles, the general interest of society or internationalization economic activity. Also, there could be other positive effects in the area of Latin America, such as decreasing tax evasion and the formalization of at least a portion of the informal sector of the economy, including the real impulse to CSR...|$|R

40|$|At {{a time of}} looming {{fiscal crisis}} and virtual {{unanimity}} that tax expenditures must be curtailed, tax subsidies for homeownership stand out as among the most costly and unfair of these expenditures. As a result of tax subsidies for homeownership, the government foregoes {{billions of dollars in}} revenue each year, most of which benefits wealthy taxpayers. Moreover, subsidies for homeownership encourage overinvestment in housing and underinvestment in other business sectors, which impedes economic productivity, jobs creation and the ability of U. S. businesses to compete in the global marketplace. Scholars and commentators have analyzed extensively the tax subsidy for home mortgage indebtedness but have paid little attention to tax subsidies for home sales. This Article is the first to undertake a comprehensive examination of tax subsidies relating to home sales. The central thesis of this Article is that these subsidies rest upon questionable policy justifications, flawed logical reasoning, and poor design choices. To support this thesis, the Article traces the evolution of tax subsidies for home sales from their surprising origins in a World War I-era tax preference for requisitioned ships to their present incarnation as a practically unlimited tax exemption. This narrative account leads to several important findings. First, it shows how path dependence and bounded rationality have led lawmakers and policymakers to make questionable decisions and support problematic laws. Second, it demonstrates the power of the real estate lobby to shape the story — and the resultant legal rules ― from both tax and social policy perspectives. Finally, it illuminates the political and rhetorical forces that have shaped tax subsidies for home sales. The Article argues that only by understanding where we were before and how we got to where we are now, can we properly assess where we should go from here. In assessing tax subsidies for home sales, the Article evaluates the subsidies by reference to the established <b>tax</b> policy <b>criteria</b> of efficiency and fairness while remaining cognizant of the broader context of the social and economic policies regarding homeownership. Although a comprehensive assessment of federal housing policies and the role of tax subsidies in structuring the domestic housing market lie beyond its scope, the Article offers important new insights that will contribute significantly to the ongoing policy dialog about homeownership in our society. In particular, it analyzes the economic impacts of tax subsidies for home sales, including whether and to what extent the subsidies contributed to the real estate bubble. Moreover, the Article highlights the important, but underappreciated, disparate race and gender impacts of homeownership as a wealth-building vehicle. Finally, the Article calls for the repeal of tax subsidies for home sales and argues that the “exogenous shock” of the global financial crisis presents a rare and fleeting opportunity to effect this reform...|$|R
