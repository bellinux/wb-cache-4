5|$|Students {{and faculty}} members of Cornell University are invited {{to apply to the}} <b>Telluride</b> House in a yearly process known as 'preferment'. Preferment, like other house matters, is decided on democratically by house members. However, faculty members of the house cannot vote. <b>Telluride</b> House members also {{contribute}} to the Association's work, through reading and evaluating applications for <b>Telluride</b> programs, such as the <b>Telluride</b> Association Summer Program.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Telluride</b> House is {{considered}} the first program of the educational non-profit <b>Telluride</b> Association, which was founded {{a year after the}} house was built and was first led by the Smithsonian Institution’s fourth Secretary Charles Doolittle Walcott. Nunn went on to found Deep Springs College in 1917. The <b>Telluride</b> Association founded and maintained other branches thereafter, two of which—at Cornell University and at the University of Michigan—are still active. The Association also runs free selective programs for high school students, including the <b>Telluride</b> Association Summer Program.|$|E

5|$|Being a soft metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion.

5|$|Tellurium, {{which is}} a {{semiconductor}} in its standard state, is used mainly as a component in type II/VI semiconducting-chalcogenides; these have applications in electro-optics and electronics.

5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold {{more often than}} in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as <b>tellurides</b> of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of <b>tellurides</b> near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|R

5|$|Tellurium has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for {{a major part of}} the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl <b>telluride,</b> although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species.

The method developed was tested with ten diorgano <b>tellurides</b> not inserted in the database showing a higher accuracy in the prediction of 125 Te and 13 C NMR chemical shifts than those predicted by the commercial program.
