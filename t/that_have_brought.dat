25|$|We do {{not discuss}} the anatomical, physiological, and mental {{characteristics}} of man considered as an individual; but {{we are interested in}} the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes. It is our task to inquire into the causes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> about the observed differentiation, and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life. In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.|$|E

Michael Curtiz was {{nominated for}} the Academy Award for Best Directing four times, finally winning for Casablanca, considered by many critic polls to be one of the greatest films ever made. George Cukor won an Academy Award for Best Director for My Fair Lady. King Vidor was {{nominated for the}} same Academy Award five times.

25|$|Roquentin's {{difficulties}} as {{arising from}} man's inherent existential condition. His seemingly special circumstances (returning from travel, reclusiveness), which {{goes beyond the}} mere indication of his very real depression, are supposed to induce in him (and in the reader) a state that makes one more receptive to noticing an existential situation that everyone has, but may not be sensitive enough to let become noticeable. Roquentin undergoes a strange metaphysical experience that estranges him from the world. His problems are not merely a result of personal insanity, without larger significance. Rather, like {{the characters in the}} Dostoevsky and Rilke novels, they are victims of larger ideological, social, and existential forces <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> them to the brink of insanity. Sartre's point in Nausea is to comment on our universal reaction to these common external problems.|$|E

Le Guin's Earthsea, Brian Aldiss's Hothouse, Isaac Asimov's Nightfall, and J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Dani Cavallaro also suggests inspiration from The Princess Who Loved Insects folktale, and the works of William Golding. Nausicaä, the character, {{was inspired}} in name and personality, by Homer's Phaeacian princess in the Odyssey. While a connection to Frank Herbert's Dune is often made there is no confirmation apart from the name [...] "Ohmu" [...] being a syllabic rendition of the English [...] "worm". Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the polluted world of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Ian DeWeese-Boyd agrees, [...] "Her commitment to love and understanding—even to the point of death—transforms {{the very nature of the}} conflict around her and begins to dispel the distorting visions <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> it about." ...|$|E

All were current or former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all except Chennault were part of the Bomber Mafia. They argued for an independent air force, in contradiction to Army doctrine. Walker told the commission: [...] "unless we create an adequate and separate Air Force, this next war 'will begin in the air and end in the mud'-in the mud and debris of the demolished industries <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> us to our knees." [...] They were unable to persuade the commission to recommend an independent air force, although it did agree that the Air Corps should be granted greater autonomy within the Army. The commission concluded that [...] "there is ample reason to believe that aircraft have now passed far beyond their former position as useful auxiliaries... An adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the refusal}} to honour the victims during the opening {{ceremony}} of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This {{was the first time}} that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by “honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> us together in this beautiful Olympic village" [...] and said that the Israelis “came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.” [...] Rogge added, [...] "we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.” In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, [...] "He is trying to do the bare minimum,” and called it [...] "shameful." [...] Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, “This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.” At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had [...] "submitted to terrorism", and would be [...] "written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace." [...] Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of Limmud International tweeted that “the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge".' ...|$|E
