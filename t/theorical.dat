2500|$|The {{freedom of}} {{association}} also includes the freedom not to associate. In certain employment circumstances employees are required {{to contribute to a}} union as conditions of their employment (see Rand formula). However, mandatory associations do not invoke section 2(d) in and of themselves. In Lavigne, the Court found that the right not to be associated extended only to where the association supported causes that went beyond what is necessary for employee representation. More generally, the Supreme Court had stated that the right is violated only when the mandatory association imposes [...] "ideological conformity". Such violations have also mostly been found by the Supreme Court to be justified under section 1, resulting in a right not to associate that has more <b>theorical</b> than practical effects.|$|E

High-tech architecture is mostly associated with non-domestic buildings, perhaps due to the technological imagery. The two most prominent proponents were Richard Rogers and Norman Foster.

50|$|Taking this, socionics also {{differs from}} other typologies {{in that it}} also {{includes}} a complementary Base-16 relationship set, {{with the intent of}} penning to paper the key social dynamic traits between grouped combinations of socionic types. Therefore, socionics could be considered to be within the realm of the science of social dynamics, intended to describe social behavior according to mathematical applications of Base-16, group theory, set logic, and reduction of the Gulenko-Jungian notation for socionics types to hexadecimal and Base-2 bitwise operation. While this mathematical approach is strictly theoretical and has been criticized for lack of empirical testing, systems theory has been the tool of socionics theorist, such as Gregory Reinin to derive <b>theorical</b> dichotomies within socionics theory. In 1985 Aušra Augustinavičiūtė acknowledged the mathematical theories of Reinin and wrote a book titled The Theory of Reinin's Traits to describe the mathematical processes of socionics theory. Mathematical methods have been a standard part of socionics theory since this time.|$|E
50|$|Because Christmas {{occurs during}} the summer in the Southern hemisphere, white Christmases are {{especially}} rare events there, apart from Antarctica which is generally uninhabited. In 2006, a snowstorm hit the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales and Victoria, arriving on Christmas Morning and bringing nearly 12 in of snow in higher areas. This was an especially rare event because it occurred during Australia's typically warm summer. In New Zealand's Southern Alps snow can fall {{any day of the}} year and a white Christmas is very possible. The same situation can be seen at the Andes at elevations above 4000msl, with some locations on the Bolivian altiplano such as El Alto having the <b>theorical</b> possibility of a white Christmas. A white Christmas in the southern hemisphere (specifically those close to Antarctica) is approximately equivalent to having snow in the northern hemisphere on 25 June, and in some ways is even less likely because the major population centers in the Northern Hemisphere tend to be farther from the equator than those in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{racial and}} ethnic {{classification}} has been closely related with Mexico's society, however {{since the end of}} the Mexican Revolution, the official identity promoted by the government has been the Mestizo one (a mix of European and indigenous culture and heritage). Installed with the original intent of eliminate divisions and create a unified identity that would allow Mexico to modernize and integrate into the international community, the Mestizo identity hasn't been able to achieve it's goal, as European characteristics are still preferred in Mexican society to this day, the reason for this is speculated to be the identity's own internal contradictions, as it includes in the same <b>theorical</b> race people who, on daily interactions, do not consider each other to be of the same race and have little in common biologicaly, with some of them being entirely Indigenous, others entirely European and including also Africans and Asians.Today, there is no definitive census that quantifies Mexico's white population, with estimations from different publications varying greatly, ranging from just 9% of the total to 47%, with this figure being based on phenotypical traits instead of self-identification of ancestry.|$|E

He is known to have helped many budding artists, both by patronage of their talent and in their personal difficulties. He sponsored Mysore Vasudevacharya (who later became a famous musician) to train at Tiruvayyar under the famous Patnam Subramanya Iyer. He also formed the [...] "Amateur Drama Club" [...] to encourage young artists. However, he died at the early age of 32 while travelling in Kolkata. Veena Shamanna was the son of Rama Bhagavatar, an immigrant from Tanjore who came to Mysore during a famine, seeking royal patronage. His birth name was Venkata Subramanya. In 1876, Veena Shamanna was appointed court musician for his talent in both vocal and instrumental classical music. He was known as [...] "Tala Brahma" [...] for his mastery of the veena, violin, ghata and swarabhat. A conservative artist, he played by the norms of <b>theorical</b> classical music and was a tutor to the royal family. In honour of his achievements, a street in Mysore city was named after him.
