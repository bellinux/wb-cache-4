5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
25|$|In birds, males {{often have}} a more {{colourful}} appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to put the organism at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators). One proposed explanation {{for this is the}} handicap principle. This hypothesis says that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his genetic fitness to females—traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be encumbered with such handicaps.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{need for}} a propagation medium for such Hertzian waves {{can be seen by}} the fact that they consist of perpendicular electric (E) and magnetic (B or H) waves. The E waves consist of undulating dipolar electric fields, and all such dipoles appeared to require separated and opposite electric charges. Electric charge is an inextricable property of matter, so it appeared that some form of matter was required to provide the alternating current <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to have to exist at any point along the propagation path of the wave. Propagation of waves in a true vacuum would imply the existence of electric fields without associated electric charge, or of electric charge without associated matter. Albeit compatible with Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic induction of electric fields could not be demonstrated in vacuum, because all methods of detecting electric fields required electrically charged matter.|$|E

25|$|In his {{earliest}} works, Orellana shows {{some of the}} signs that were to become the Neo-figuration, with expressive and yet undefined figures. Orellana's works from this period are distinguished for their almost monochromatic nature, where most figures appear in black and grayscale, to the point that, {{even though there is}} a predominant use of oxides and sand, they had an almost watercoulour appearance. On 8 December 1959, the Grupo Hondo proclaims its Neo-figurative theoric principles in a manifesto written by the poet Manuel Conde, of which Orellana is a founding member. In this period, Orellana reaches maturity as an artist, and his paintings reach the confluence of informal abstraction and the mannerism of an existential figuration <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> even mystical in its representation. In this period, Orellana's work is enriched in terms of colour and texture, developing his artistic expression in a most definite manner.|$|E
25|$|A fume event {{occurs when}} bleed air used for cabin {{pressurization}} {{and air conditioning}} in a pressurized aircraft is contaminated by fluids such as engine oil, hydraulic fluid, anti-icing fluid, and other potentially hazardous chemicals. Turbine engine oil is an irritant and contains neurotoxic chemicals such as tricresyl phosphate. The aviation industry claim that engine oil does not contain sufficient quantities of such chemicals to cause long-term damage. However, there is some historical evidence <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to contradict this statement. In 1959, over 10,000 people in Morocco were paralyzed or otherwise effected after ingesting small quantities of tricresyl phosphate in their cooking oil. Unlike tricresyl phosphate, hydraulic fluid — although non-toxic in small quantities — is extremely irritating to the eyes and skin, which creates a hazard to pilots during a fume event but causes no lasting damage. Deicing fluid has a strong smell but is not very irritating or toxic.|$|E
25|$|Escrivá's {{successful}} petition of a {{title of}} nobility has aroused controversy {{not only because}} it might seem at odds with the humility befitting a Catholic priest, but also because the same title of Marquess of Peralta had been rehabilitated during 1883 by Pope Leo XIII and King Alfonso XII in favor of a man to whom Escrivá had no male-line family association: the Costa Rican diplomat Manuel María de Peralta y Alfaro (1847–1930). On that occasion, the documents ordering the rehabilitation claimed that the original title had been granted during 1738 (not 1718) to Juan Tomás de Peralta y Franco de Medina, by Charles of Austria in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor, not as pretender to the Spanish throne. Ambassador Peralta, who during 1884 had married a Belgian countess, Jehanne de Clérembault, died without children during 1930. None of his kinsmen in Costa Rica requested the transmission of the marquessate, but one of them has published an extensive genealogical study <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to contradict any claim by Escrivá to the title.|$|E

25|$|Optimal {{foraging}} theory (OFT) {{states that}} organisms forage {{in such a}} way as to maximize their energy intake per unit time. In other words, animals behave {{in such a way}} as to find, capture, and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. The sexual division of labor provides an appropriate explanation as to why males forgo the opportunity to gather any items with caloric value- a strategy <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> suboptimal from an energetic standpoint. The OFT suggests that the sexual division of labor is an adaptation that benefits the household; thus, foraging behavior of males will appear optimal at the level of the family. If a hunter-gatherer man does not rely on resources from others and passes up a food item with caloric value, it can be assumed that he is foraging at an optimal level. But, if he passes up the opportunity because it is a food that women routinely gather, then as long as men and women share their spoils, it will be optimal for men to forgo the collection and continue searching for different resources to complement the resources gathered by women.|$|E

[...] {Mather's [...] "Remarkable Providences" [...] was distributed this same month, with echoes to the New England government Increase Mather assembles in 1692.} It had been Phips' debut into colonial politics too, if clumsily and involuntarily. [...] To what extent he was swayed by the arguments of Randolph as they crossed the Atlantic, it is hard to know, but Phips certainly played the role with bluster, and he seems to have spoken up as a royalist to the Boston government in the meetings he had with Bradstreet and Stoughton, at least as recorded by Knepp. [...] By 1688, Phips would cross over to Increase Mather's side and begin to consistently oppose Randolph and the Dominion government he helped to bring about, and with a vehemence <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to suggest some degree of shame and dismay for the role he played as captain of HMS Rose in 1683-4.|$|E

The symposium focused its attention on how modern microevolutionary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that [...] "Eldredge's 1971 publication [...] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly." [...] According to Gould [...] "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould." [...] In his book Time Frames Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair [...] "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day." ...|$|E

During this scene Haynes played appropriate music to help Blackwood get into the mood, as he had done during similar scenes when directing [...] "The Pandorica Opens". The set was filled with things <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> like typical exhibits in the daytime, but appeared spooky at night.

500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that {{what he had to say}} was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E

Hammer-ons and pull-offs ("HOPOs") for the previous Guitar Hero games were automatically placed by the software; in this iteration, the engine was designed to allow manual placement of HOPOs {{to make it easier to}} create certain effects in songs, such as sustained string bends. Character animations were selected from several made available by the animation team, while stage lighting and effects were selected to mimic those used in live performances from YouTube or from concert appearances. A separate team came up with the concepts for the various stages and arenas in the game. The team wanted keep the same art style as the previous Guitar Hero games but add [...] "a certain spark" [...] to improve upon previous designs. Once a stage idea was brainstormed, the team sought visual references from real stages to expand upon, and a 2D drawing of the envisioned stage was prepared for review and to remain a constant goal of the stage design. From that, a [...] "pop up" [...] three-dimensional version of the stage was created, and elements from the 2D concept art were added to determine the appropriate placement of set decorations. This team worked with the animation department to place the band members, stage lighting, and other effects in the game before the final 3D version of the stage was completed. The final stages included several animated elements to help further bring the stage to life.|$|E
