5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} <b>to</b> <b>equip</b> an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists <b>to</b> <b>equip</b> them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E

50|$|Like Bremen, Europa {{had a small}} {{seaplane}} {{launched from}} a catapult on her upper deck between the funnels. The airplane flew from the ship to a landing at the seaplane port in Blexen.

5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets <b>to</b> <b>equip</b> themselves.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons <b>to</b> <b>equip</b> its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E

Since 2001, optional surround sound systems are offered via high-end audio purveyor Mark Levinson. For reduced cabin noise, the first LS 400 introduced sandwich steel plating, and later models added acoustic glass. In 2006, the LS 460 debuted the first ceiling air diffusers and infrared body temperature sensors in a car. Telematics services include G-Book with G-Link in Asia and Lexus Enform in North America.|$|E

5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank {{communication}} devices. The plan was <b>to</b> <b>equip</b> each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander's tank would be equipped with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in the platoon, one for communication with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special terminal block was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E

5|$|Singapore was an {{enthusiastic}} operator of the Hunter, first ordering the aircraft in 1968 during a massive {{expansion of the}} city-state's armed forces; deliveries began in 1971 and were completed by 1973. At the time, considerable international controversy was generated as Britain (and, as was later revealed, the U.S.) had refused to sell Hunters to neighbouring Malaysia, sparking fears of a regional arms race and accusations of favouritism. The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) eventually received 46 refurbished Hunters <b>to</b> <b>equip</b> two squadrons.|$|E

A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was designed to fit on a simple box structure in the back of an M3 Half-track.|$|E

These {{were followed by}} a series of increasingly mammoth weapons—guns weighing 12, 25, 25, 38 and finally 81tons, with calibre increasing from 8-inch (203mm) to 16-inch (406mm).|$|E
