5|$|Every {{game that}} has been {{produced}} in the WWE 2K series is developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and published by 2K Sports. From 1999 – 2013 the publisher was THQ. The game engine was originally based on the one used by the Japanese professional wrestling video game series Toukon Retsuden, which was also developed by Yuke's. Before the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, the only communication possible in season mode was through subtitles. Voice over, however, was included in season mode {{with the release of}} WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW. WWE superstars record a script, which is then assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding superstar in the game. With the exception of WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain, pre-recorded commentary by WWE commentators has been included in each game since the release of WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It.|$|E

25|$|Both The Coquette and Charlotte Temple are {{novels that}} treat {{the right of}} women to live as equals as the new {{democratic}} experiment. These novels are of the Sentimental genre, characterized by overindulgence in emotion, an invitation to listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> reason against misleading passions, {{as well as an}} optimistic overemphasis on the essential goodness of humanity. Sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the Calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature.|$|E
25|$|When Charles endeavoured {{to raise}} a guard for his own person at York, {{intending}} it, as the event afterwards proved, to form the nucleus of an army, Lord Fairfax was required by Parliament to present a petition to his sovereign, entreating Charles to hearken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> his Parliament, and to discontinue the raising of troops. This was at a great meeting of the freeholders and farmers of Yorkshire convened by the king on Heworth Moor on 3 June near York. Charles evaded receiving the petition, pressing his horse forward, but Thomas Fairfax followed him and placed the petition on the pommel of the king's saddle.|$|E
25|$|Mai FM was commercially {{successful}} and was expanded to other regions. It formed a broadcasting partnership with Ngai Tahu's Tahu FM in Christchurch between 1996 and 2001, {{and took over}} one of the frequencies of Te Arawa's Whanau FM in 1998. Ruia Mai, by contrast, reached a smaller audience of fluent Māori language speakers, and focused on programmes reflecting Ngāti Whatua and Māori culture. It was reliant on its news and current affairs contract with Te Māngai Pāho, and closed in 2004 when it lost the contract to bilingual radio station Radio Waatea. Ngāti Whatua retained the frequency, initially leasing it out <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> Samoa before using it for AKE 1179AM.|$|E

25|$|Griffin {{also sought}} to shed the BNP's image as a single-issue party, by {{embracing}} a diverse array {{of social and economic}} issues. Griffin renamed the party's monthly newspaper from British Nationalist <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> Freedom, and established a new journal, Identity. The party developed community-based campaigns, through which it targeted local issues, particularly in those areas with large numbers of skilled white working-class people who were disaffected with the Labour Party government. For instance, in Burnley it campaigned for lower speed limits on housing estates and against the closure of a local swimming bath, while in South Birmingham it targeted pensioners' concerns about youth gangs. In 2006 the party urged its activists to carry out local activities like cleaning up children's play areas and removing graffiti while wearing high-vis jackets emblazoned with the party logo.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} decade {{important}} women writers also published novels. Susanna Rowson {{is best known for}} her novel, Charlotte: A Tale of Truth, published in London in 1791. In 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title, Charlotte Temple. Charlotte Temple is a seduction tale, written in the third person, which warns against listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> love and counsels resistance. She also wrote nine novels, six theatrical works, two collections of poetry, six textbooks, and countless songs. Reaching more than {{a million and a half}} readers over a century and a half, Charlotte Temple was the biggest seller of the 19th century before Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Although Rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel, Charlotte Temple is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction.|$|E

50|$|The five codes {{together}} {{constitute a}} way of interpreting the text which suggests that textuality is interpretive; that the codes are not superimposed upon the text, but, rather, approximate something that is intrinsic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> text.

On June 21, 1848, Heliade Rădulescu and Tell were present in Islaz, where, with the Orthodox priest Șapcă of Celei, they revealed the revolutionary program to a cheering crowd (see Proclamation of Islaz). A new government was formed on the spot, comprising Tell, Heliade Rădulescu, Ștefan Golescu, Șapcă, and Nicolae Pleșoianu—they wrote Prince Bibescu an appeal, which called on him to recognize the program as the embryo of a constitution and to [...] "listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> the motherland and place himself {{at the head of}} this great accomplishment".|$|E

500|$|The call {{is a low}} drumming, {{accompanied}} by a tuk, tuk, tuk made with the wings. The nature of the vocalisation led to a local legend that the sound is made by the bird beating on a hollow tree or branch with its feet. Gerd Heinrich noted the local name [...] "soisa", meaning drum, and described the call as being a subdued drumming purre – purre – purre – purre – purre which sometimes ends in a loud shrill scream. The bird also produced a dull hum similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> the banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus) and reminiscent of {{the call of the}} snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni). Calling is most frequent in the early morning or late evening, and a human tapping a sago stem with a machete may elicit a response from the bird.

500|$|Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan {{argued that}} Tamarod protests on 14 August {{had failed to}} live up to the expectations.

Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it [...] "physically impossible" [...] for big numbers to gather in one place.

500|$|The {{writings}} of Carl Jung were influential in Le Guin's work. In an essay discussing his impact, Le Guin stated that {{to find a}} true sense of community, a child had to confront the unexplored parts of its own self, or what Jung {{referred to as the}} [...] "collective unconscious". Thus many of her writings feature young people trying to find a sense of community in circumstances of lawlessness and disorder. Voices depicts characters who are unable to explore their identities due to the oppressive regime they live under, an inability which particularly affects the young characters. Another recurring theme in Voices is the power of words and storytelling, illustrated through the character of Orrec, who uses his poetry to spread ideas of freedom. The title [...] "Voices" [...] has multiple interpretations: the voices of the poets that are frequently referred <b>to,</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> the Oracle, the voices of the people of Ansul who rise up against the Alds, and the voice of Memer herself.|$|E
