5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} United Kingdom. London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, due to <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E

25|$|The {{program has}} been dogged by {{controversy}} over {{the treatment of the}} animals and speculation as to <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> mission and training. This has been due at least in part to the secrecy of the program, which was de-classified in the early 1990s. Since the program’s inception, there have been ongoing animal welfare concerns, with many opposing the use of marine mammals in military applications, even in essentially non-combatant roles such as mine detection. The Navy cites external oversight, including ongoing monitoring, in defense of its animal care standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} the Abkhazian Kingdom, {{particularly}} the questions of <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> ruling family and its ethnic composition, is a major point of controversy between modern Georgian and Abkhaz scholars. This can be largely explained by the scarcity of primary sources on these issues. Most Abkhaz historians claim the kingdom was formed {{as a result of}} the consolidation of the early Abkhaz tribes that enabled them to extend their dominance over the neighboring areas. This is objected to on the side of the Georgian historians, some of them claiming that the kingdom was completely Georgian.|$|E

25|$|Although the species, {{including}} {{many of its}} synonyms, has been placed in the genus Alepes for some time, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> teeth has made this placement controversial. Two authors {{have argued that the}} species should be reassigned to a new monotypic genus due to it having short conical teeth in comparison to the rest of Alepes comblike teeth. This problem was addressed in a molecular phylogenetic study of the Carangidae in which A. kleinii and A. djedaba (Shrimp scad) were included. The results confirmed the placement of A. kleinii in Alepes, with the authors arguing the two species were too closely related to warrant placement in a new genus.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, a {{labourer}} {{uncovered a}} burial at Pouan-les-Vallées, a {{village on the}} south bank of the Aube River, that consisted of a skeleton {{with a number of}} jewels and gold ornaments and buried with two swords. By <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> grave goods, it was initially thought to be the burial of Theodoric, but Hodgkin expressed skepticism, suggesting that this elite burial was that of a princely Germanic warrior who had lived in the 5th century. The Treasure of Pouan is conserved in the Musée Saint-Loup (Musée d'Art d'Archéologie et de Sciences Naturelles), Troyes. It is still unknown whether or not the find is related to the battle.|$|E

25|$|As an {{integral}} part of worship in most Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregations members celebrate the Lord's Supper. Most congregations also sing hymns, read from the Old and New Testaments of Christian Scripture, hear the word of God proclaimed through sermon or other medium and extend an invitation to become Christ's Disciples. As a congregational church, each congregation determines <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> worship, study, Christian service, and witness to the world. Through the observance of communion, individuals are invited to acknowledge their faults and sins, to remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, to remember their baptism, and to give thanks for God's redeeming love. The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) believes that it is in the local congregations where people come, find, and know God as they gather in Christ's name. Because Disciples believe that the invitation to the table comes from Jesus Christ, communion is open to all who confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, regardless of their denominational affiliation.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, {{within weeks}} of Hitler's rise to power in Germany, the German Consul-General in Jerusalem for Palestine, Heinrich Wolff, sent a {{telegram}} to Berlin reporting al-Husseini's belief that Palestinian Muslims were enthusiastic about the new regime and {{looked forward to the}} spread of Fascism throughout the region. Wolff met al-Husseini and many sheikhs again, a month later, at Nabi Musa. They expressed their approval of the anti-Jewish boycott in Germany and asked Wolff not to send any Jews to Palestine. Wolff subsequently wrote in his annual report for that year that the Arabs' political naïvety led them to fail to recognize the link between German Jewish policy and their problems in Palestine, and that their enthusiasm for Nazi Germany was devoid of any real understanding of the phenomenon. The various proposals by Palestinian Arab notables like al-Husseini were rejected consistently over the years out of concern to avoid disrupting Anglo-German relations, in line with Germany's policy of not imperilling their economic and cultural interests in the region by a change in their policy of neutrality, and respect for British interests. Hitler's Englandpolitik essentially precluded significant assistance to Arab leaders. Italy also made <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> assistance to the Palestinian contingent on the outcome of its own negotiations with Britain, and cut off aid when it appeared that the British were ready to admit the failure of their pro-Zionist policy in Palestine. Al-Husseini's adversary, Ze'ev Jabotinsky had at the same time cut off Irgun ties with Italy after the passage of antisemitic racial legislation.|$|E

These reactions are still not common in open chain systems because of the highly ordered nature of the transition state, which is more readily achieved in cyclic molecules.|$|E
