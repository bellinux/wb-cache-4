40|$|In {{the early}} stages of the {{inflammatory}} process, monocytes and granulocytes constitute important effector cells that must function correctly in order to clear infection. By activating leukocytes in vitro it is possible to mimic the in vivo activation of these cells and study their activation potential. However, in vitro activation may not tell the entire story: cells that have been exposed to inflammatory mediators in vivo could have an altered response when activated in vitro. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the functional response, with different activation markers, of peripheral granulocytes and monocytes, in relation to selected inflammatory conditions. Peripheral leukocytes from blood donors are frequently used as control cells in laboratory tests. It is known that blood sampling and separation techniques can affect the quantitative levels of activation markers on leukocytes. In the first study we therefore investigated the influence of two different blood sampling procedures, in a blood donation setting, on peripheral granulocytes. We found that a brief contact with <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> generated an ex vivo activation of peripheral neutrophils probably due to activation of the complement system within <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube.</b> During coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) a whole body inflammatory response occurs, and the heart-lung machine (CPB) has been thought to be the major contributor to this phenomenon. In the second and third part of this thesis we evaluated the impact of the CP 13 on peripheral phagocytes during CABG. Patients were randomised to surgery with (ONCAB) or without (OFFCAB) CPB. We could demonstrate less complement activation in OFFCAB compared to ONCAB patients during and 24 hours after CABG surgery. Despite this finding, both neutrophil and monocyte adhesion molecule expression was similar for both patient groups. The cells responsiveness to in vitro activation was also similar. Neutrophil numbers increased during and after CABG surgery whereas the number of circulating eosinophils decreased considarably. We also found a selective decrease in the numbers of CD 14 +/CD 16 + monocytes during surgery. Both neutrophils and monocytes are activated as a consequence of CABG without apparent additional effects of CPB. The investigated parameters indicate that the surgical trauma could be the most important factor contributing to the enhanced inflammatory response noted during cardiac surgery. In the last part of the study we investigated the systemic influence of a chronic inflammatory condition, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), on peripheral blood phagocytes. We found that neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils from both COPD patients and asymptomatic smokers have an impaired oxidative burst in vitro compared to those from non-smokers. In addition patients and smokers also have vascular involvement as determined by elevated levels of sICAM 1. There were no differences in adhesion molecule expression or mobilisation between the studied groups although smoking had an acute effect on CD 11 b mobilisation in COPD patients. These findings may in part explain why COPD patients show increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis demonstrate the value of monitoring peripheral granulocytes and monocytes during acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.

40|$|Introduction The Comecer ALCEO Metal {{system is}} {{intended}} to be a comprehensive solid targetry system, capable of all steps necessary to produce copper isotopes (60 Cu, 61 Cu & 64 Cu) from enriched nickel: plating, transfer to/from cyclotron, irradiation, and dissolution/purification. To develop plating and chemistry methods, we plate natural nickel, and irradiate with deuterons to produce 61 Cu. This alleviates the need for expensive enriched nickel isotopes, but gives a lower activity yield. We report a few issues with the ALCEO system, and some of our modifications. Material and Methods BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The ALCEO system uses cylindrical shuttles (dia 28 mm, height 35 mm) comprised of an Al body with a Pt well, onto which the Ni is plated. Shuttles are transferred pneumatically from the hot cell to the irradiation module, {{on the end of the}} cyclotron beamline. The plating and dissolution are both done at the electrochemical cell, located in the hot cell. This cell is connected by capillary tubes to the electrolytic solution reservoir (for plating), or the acid reservoir (for dissolution). These tubes form a recirculation loop, through which the fluid is propelled by an inline micropump throughout plating and dissolution. The platinum well is 16 mm in diameter, while an O-ring is used to plate only the center (6 mm in diameter). A constant DC voltage is applied. PLATING: We dissolve natural nickel nitrate (99. 999 % pure) into an electrolytic solution comprised of deionized water, ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride (pH = 9. 3). We use 30 – 100 mg of natNi in a 10 mg/mL solution. We have varied the ALCEO electrochemical cell voltage between 2. 25 – 3 VDC, and tried to maintain a low pump flow rate between 1 – 2 mL/min. The electrochemical cell uses a fixed metal tube as the anode (~ 3 mm above the plating surface). This tube also delivers the electrolytic plating solution to the Pt surface, forming part of the recirculating loop. The Pt surface is in contact with a gold-plated cathode. Due to issues discussed below, we have built a custom plating rig for the ALCEO shuttles, which does not use the pump/recirculation loop, but leaves the reservoir of electrolytic solution in place, atop the plating surface. A graphite rod is used for the anode, rotating offcenter ~ 2 mm above the plating surface. We use the same size O-ring to plate only the center 6 mm of the Pt surface, and apply a constant DC voltage. TRANSFER TO/FROM CYCLOTRON: The pneumatic transfer tube is 50 ft long between the hot cell and the cyclotron vault, and has a rise of 14 ft from under the floor to the ceiling of the cyclotron vault. IRRADIATION: The ALCEO irradiation module holds the plating surface orthogonal to the beam path. The module has a 10 -mil-thick (0. 010 ”) Al front foil, supported by a hex-grid. Once we realized the thickness, we replaced this with a 1 -mil-thick Al foil, followed by a 1 -mil-thick Havar foil. The foil is cooled by a flow of helium, while the shuttle and grid are cooled by a flow of water. The helium and water are cooled in heat ex-changers by chilled water. As initially plumbed, the chilled water flowed through the heat ex-changers in series, cooling the helium first, then the water. After initial runs, we plumbed the heat exchangers in parallel, teeing the chilled water to the supply of each heat exchanger, and teeing the returns together. Irradiation is performed with a PETtrace 800 accelerating deuterons to 8. 4 MeV on target. The beam current limit is 20 μA for the ALCEO Metal target. A set point of 19 μA is used to avoid the system tripping off. DISSOLUTION/PURIFICATION: The ALCEO system circulates 5 mL of 6 M HCl, while heating the shuttle to 100 ⁰C for 40 min. This solution is loaded onto a column containing 10 g of 200 – 400 mesh chromatographic resin in chloride form. A separation is performed yielding three solutions: The column is washed with 40 mL of 6 M HCl to obtain the Recovered Nickel Solution, then 20 mL of 4 M HCl to obtain the Cobalt Solution, then 10 mL of 0. 5 M HCl to obtain the Cop-per Product Solution. Results and Conclusion PLATING: Using the ALCEO method, the platings obtained had a tendency to mound, (up to 0. 75 mm thick for 50 mg) giving a lower density of 3 – 4 g/cm 3. This was attributed to the anode tube being fixed in place over the center of the plating surface. Using the custom rig, almost no mounding was observed, (0. 25 mm thick for 50 mg) giving a density of 7 g/cm 3, closer to nickel’s nominal density of 8. 9 g/cm 3. FIGS. 1 and 2 attempt to show the mounding from the ALCEO method, and relative flatness from the custom rig. Both methods give a rough, or “fuzzy” plated surface. FIG. 2 shows that the custom rig exaggerates this “fuzziness”. Using the ALCEO method, a slower pump speed (~ 1 mL/min) gives a smoother plating surface, but the pump has a tendency to lock up at this lower set point, stalling the plating. Using the ALCEO method, slight increases in the voltage (2. 65 V instead of 2. 25 V), can form thin stalagmites of nickel, electrically connecting the anode and the plating surface, ending the chance for a useable plating. Using the custom rig, no stalagmites are seen, adjusting the voltage from 2. 3 to 3. 0 V. This leads to the potential for a faster plating. Both the ALCEO method and the custom rig have obtained plating efficiencies of 95 %. TRANSFER TO/FROM CYCLOTRON: The shuttle typically transfers without issue in < 15 seconds. Once or twice it has remained in <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube,</b> but been retrieved by cycling the com-pressed air/vacuum a couple of times. IRRADIATION: During initial testing, the temperature of the return water rose rapidly during irradiation. This was attributed to the chilled water already gaining heat from the helium heat exchanger. Once the parallel chilled water plumbing was implemented, the water temperature rose much more slowly. Initial testing with the 10 -mil Al foils gave a very poor activity yield. The 1 -mil Al foil ruptured under the 20 psi helium pressure before beam was applied. The 1 -mil Havar foil produced 1. 57 mCi of 61 Cu at EOB, giving an activity yield of 0. 308 mCi/μAh (results summarized in TABLE 1). This compares to yields of 1. 4 obtained by [1], and 0. 29 obtained by [2] for deuterons on natNi. DISSOLUTION/PURIFICATION: The dissolution in 6 M HCl is close to 100 % efficient by weight. After purification, the three solutions were assayed by dose calibrator as summarized in TABLE 2. The purification is very efficient at removing the starting material, and long-lived Co isotopes from the Copper Product Solution, as seen with the 57 -hour EOB measurements. However, much of the desired 61 Cu is removed as well, with only 32 % remaining in the product. The lack of nuclide impurities in the Copper Product Solution was confirmed by gamma spectroscopy using a HP-Ge detector...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> performance and <b>the</b> thermal efficiency of a molten salt receiver used in the solar power tower plant. A test-bed is built, {{and a series of}} experiments of heat transfer enhancement for two types of molten salt receiver tubes, including smooth and spiral tubes, have been carried out under the high temperature and the high heat flux conditions. The experimental results show that the Nusselt numbers of spiral <b>tube</b> with heat <b>transfer</b> enhancement are in the range of 400 - 1200, which is about 3 times than that of the smooth one on average. The wall temperature of the spiral tube is decreased by about 30 Â Â°C comparing with that of the smooth tube under <b>the</b> identical heat <b>transfer</b> conditions. <b>The</b> results of the experiment show that, by using the spiral <b>tube</b> as <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> performance of <b>the</b> molten salt receiver is obviously improved, and the radiation and convection losses are significantly reduced. The results will be helpful for the design of the molten salt receiver. Molten salt receiver Heat <b>transfer</b> enhancement Spiral <b>tube</b> Radiation and convection losses...|$|R

By simplifying <b>the</b> model, heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> model with spoiler lever was obtained and simulated, the distribution of temperature field, gas ratio, velocity field and press field in rib tube were analyzed, and different inlet velocity of LNG, roughness of the tube wall both effected on the overall gasification, the results shows that the actual gasification efficiency from heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> is higher than normal, small difference of gas ratio outlet, velocity and temperature are both lower, LNG could be easer gasified at operating temperature between - 162 °C~+ 3 °C than that between - 162 °C~+ 0 °C...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{observation}} of HCFC 141 b gas hydrate growth process {{outside of a}} horizontal heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> was done on a visual apparatus of gas hydrate reaction system. Growth processes of two situations (with, or without sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) were observed, their growth morphology were compared and explained with the theory of surface free energy. During the experiment process, phenomenon of gas hydrate fast nucleation from melting ice was found and explained with Zhou V Sloan's hypothesis qualitatively. From the experiment results, {{it was found that}} gas hydrate formed in the liquid HCFC 141 b phase along <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> in a system with SDS (SDS water solution-liquid HCFC 141 b system), while along the glass in a system without SDS (distilled water-liquid HCFC 141 b system), so the formation heat of gas hydrate can be absorbed more quickly in a system with SDS than in a system without SDS, which lead to a more quick growth rate. According to the above research, some suggestions were presented on the designation of heat exchanger and reaction materials for the gas hydrate indirect-contact cool storage system.

40|$|In our {{previous}} work, {{a new concept}} of annular catalyst cooler (ACC) was proposed and validated experimentally, which showed that an internal circulation of solids could be formed by using two gas distributors and both hydrodynamics and heat transfer could be largely improved. The current work simulated detailed hydrodynamics of gas-solids flow to advance {{our understanding of the}} ACC by using the two-fluid model. The influences of effective particle diameter dp⁎ and specularity coefficient φ were examined and compared with experimental data. Optimum values of dp⁎ = 170 μm and φ = 0. 3 were determined and used in the simulations. Detailed hydrodynamics of gas-solids flow were then obtained, and the influential parameters were examined. The results showed that the proper selection of the ratio of gas velocities and the position of <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> were needed to form a stable internal solids circulation in the ACC. The ACC had a combined hydrodynamic feature of up-flow and down-flow catalyst coolers with bigger solids volume fraction and smaller particle resident time, which are beneficial for improving <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> between solids and wall...|$|R
40|$|Removal of fireside {{deposits}} from <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tubes</b> in kraft recovery boilers {{is carried}} out by sootblowing and occasionally "chill-and- blow" practices. During chill-and-blow, black liquor flow is reduced to rapidly cool the deposits. Thermal stresses generated in the deposit {{as a result of}} thermal shock can effectively weaken the deposit, facilitating its cleaning. For this study, we investigated the mechanical weakening effect of thermal stresses generated by the transient temperature gradients. We quantified the mechanical weakening effect due to thermal shock by measuring the decrease in biaxial flexure strength of a preheated sodium chloride disk at various quenching times and surface heat transfer coefficients. We observed that the mechanical weakening occured by transient thermal stresses as well as crack propagation. Approximately 35 % loss in biaxial flexure strength could be achieved at heat transfer coefficients above 3. 3 · 103 W/m 2 K, and at quenching durations above 40 s...|$|R

Besides, if the heat stored is released, it can supply heat for buildings or raise the road surface temperature for snow melting in winter. A road-solar energy system was built in this study, and <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> mechanism and effect of the system were analyzed according to the monitored solar radiant heat, the solar energy absorbed by road and the heat stored by soil. The results showed that the road surface temperature was mainly affected by solar radiation, but the effect is hysteretic in nature. The temperature of the solar road surface was 3 °C– 6 °C lower than that of the ordinary road surface. The temperature of the solar road along the vertical direction was 2 °C– 5 °C lower than that of the ordinary road. The temperature difference increased as the distance to <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tubes</b> decreased. <b>The</b> average solar collector efficiency of the system was 14. 4 %, and the average solar absorptivity of road surface was 36 %.

I {{would like to}} thank the {{following}} people for help, advice, and encouragement throughout this project. Professor Hans W. Liepmann has my greatest admiration and respect. I particularly appreciate the freedom and support that he gave me to pursue research topics of my choosing. It is my hope that some of his enthusiasm to understand and his ability to do so will rub off. Thomas Roesgen greatly aided the author by introducing him to the computer as a practical lab research tool. He also provided constant evaluation, insight, and advice as acuities were encountered and surmounted (he also held the top end of <b>the</b> helium <b>transfer</b> <b>tube).</b> Bill Kath gave constant encouragement and friendship throughout the years here. He made several observations that forced the author to understand cer-tain helium experiments more clearly.
