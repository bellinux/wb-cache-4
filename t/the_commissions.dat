40|$|Does <b>the</b> European <b>Commission</b> (Commission) {{manage to}} {{transform}} and re-direct the roles played by Commission civil servants? To test the old neo-functionalist claim on loyalty transfer among civil servants, {{this article provides}} fresh survey and interview data on seconded national experts in <b>the</b> <b>Commission.</b> <b>The</b> transformative powers of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> are tested by assessing {{the extent to which}} seconded national experts adopt supranational role perceptions. Theoretically, the emergence of supranational role perceptions is accounted for by considering (i) processes of pre-socialisation outside <b>the</b> <b>Commission,</b> (ii) processes of resocialisation inside <b>the</b> <b>Commission,</b> and (iii) organisational incompatibility between <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> and domestic ministries and agencies from which the secondees originate. The empirical analysis shows that secondees evoke multiple loyalties, notably towards own profession, own DG and Unit and towards the EU and <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> as wholes. Crucially, the data reported demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> indeed instils supranational role perceptions into secondees. This observation reflects processes of re-socialisation inside <b>the</b> <b>Commission,</b> <b>the</b> organisational composition of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> as well as organizational incompatibilities between <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> and domestic ministries and agencies. The data does not report robust evidence of pre-socialisation outside <b>the</b> <b>Commission.</b> Hence, <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> is indeed a ‘hothouse for supranationalism’...|$|R

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to <b>the</b> <b>commissions</b> at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E

5|$|The 5th National Congress again {{amended the}} party constitution, adding {{a chapter on}} control {{commissions}} and their aims but devoting little attention to their operations.

5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain {{of the life of}} Hieronymus Bosch or of <b>the</b> <b>commissions</b> or {{influences}} that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in {{a hierarchy of}} six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. <b>The</b> <b>commissions</b> of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E
5|$|In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio {{defeated}} Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of}} {{the most}} hotly contested presidential elections to that time in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Payne was named to the committee at Tilden's request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After <b>the</b> <b>Commissions</b> result, Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall in accepting the Commission's result. The effort failed, and Hayes became president on March 4, 1877.|$|E

5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in <b>the</b> <b>commissions</b> report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E

25|$|Marbury posed a {{difficult}} {{problem for the}} court, which was then led by Chief Justice John Marshall, the same person who had neglected to deliver <b>the</b> <b>commissions</b> {{when he was the}} Secretary of State. If Marshall's court commanded James Madison to deliver <b>the</b> <b>commissions,</b> Madison might ignore the order, thereby indicating the weakness of the court. Similarly, if the court denied William Marbury's request, the court would be seen as weak. Marshall held that appointee Marbury was indeed entitled to his commission. However, Justice Marshall contended that the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional, since it purported to grant original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in cases not involving the States or ambassadors. The ruling thereby established that the federal courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch.|$|E
