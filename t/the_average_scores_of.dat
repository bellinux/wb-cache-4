50|$|Self-disclosure is {{also very}} {{important}} {{when it comes to}} a close dating relationship between men and women. Successful communication in relationships is one of the greatest difficulties most couples are forced to overcome. Men in relationships with women may practice self-disclosure more often than their female partner. Self-disclosure is considered to be a key factor in facilitating intimacy. For example, American heterosexual couples were studied using various measures twice a year. By using <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> both partners, they found that self-disclosure was higher in those couples who remained together at the second administration of the surveys than in those who broke up between two administrations. Similarly, researchers asked heterosexual couples who had just begun dating to complete a self-disclosure measure and to answer the same questionnaire four months later. They found that couples who were still dating four months later reported greater self-disclosure at the initial contact than did those who later broke up. This test shows self-disclosure can be beneficial to facilitating a positive relationship. Self-disclosure is a process which typically begins rapidly, but then plateaus as the couple gains more information. The initial self-disclosure is extremely important when first meeting someone. The first interactions between a potential couple could be deciding factors in the success or failure of the relationship.|$|E

Expectations, however, were significantly lower on him in the vault individual event final as he only managed to finish in seventh place at the last world championships. Appearing not to be affected at all {{by any of the}} emotional restraints from the day before, Shirai scored an average of 15.449, 15.833 and 15.066 on each of his two vaults respectively with the former being the highest-scoring vault of the night in both difficulty and execution, a detail which seemed insignificant at the time but ended up being very much so later in the competition. After the scores of all eight finalists were assessed {{at the end of the}} night, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> Shirai and Marian Dragulescu of Romania, who also gave his best performance in an Olympic Games that evening, were high enough to tie for third place and resulted in a tie-breaking procedure specific only to the Olympic Games, which in this instance had worked in Shirais favour due to the single best score in one of his two vaults being higher than Dragulescus, to be automatically activated.

5000|$|Unlike other {{standardized}} admissions tests (such as the SAT, LSAT, and MCAT), the use {{and weight}} of GRE scores vary considerably not only from school to school, but from department to department, and from program to program. As an example, most business schools and economics programs require very high GRE or GMAT scores for entry, while engineering programs are known to allow more score variation. Programs in liberal arts topics may only consider the applicant's verbal score to be of interest, while mathematics and science programs may only consider quantitative ability. Admission to graduate schools depends on a complex mix of several different factors. Schools see letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, GPA, GRE score etc. Some schools use the GRE in admissions decisions, but not in funding decisions; others use the GRE for the selection of scholarship and fellowship candidates, but not for admissions. In some cases, the GRE may be a general requirement for graduate admissions imposed by the university, while particular departments may not consider the scores at all. [...] Graduate schools will typically provide information about how the GRE is considered in admissions and funding decisions, and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> previously admitted students. In some cases programs have hard cut off requirements for the GRE, such as the Yale Economics PhD program which requires a minimum quantitative score of 160 to apply. The best {{way to find out}} how a particular school or program evaluates a GRE score in the admissions process is to contact the person in charge of graduate admissions for the specific program in question.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} steps {{involved}} in deriving and calculating the EPI. First, {{a set of}} blended variables of “brand positioning” and “ethics” is identified, consisting of five elements of brand positioning sub-divided into 15 and ten sub-elements of ethics. Then, consumer ratings are obtained for all the elements on a 1-5 scale, which in total makes 25 values ranging from 1 to 5. The sub-element scores are then averaged over the whole sample to obtain an average score for each sub-element. Thus, a set of 25 average score is obtained. Second, the sub-elements of brand positioning are taken and combined to obtain five sub-elements of brand positioning.The calculation of scores for the five brand positioning variables is done by evaluating the arithmetic mean of the various sub-elements that a brand positioning variable includes. Thus, a set of five average scores, labeled as SB1-SB5, is obtained which reflect the consumer preference for the various attributes. Similarly, a score is obtained for the ten sub-elements of ethics and are labeled as SE1-SE10. A high score reflects greater liking while a low score indicates dislike and insignificance. Third, the weights are obtained for the various elements. To obtain the weight {{for each of the}} five brand positioning variables, the average score of the variable was divided by the sum of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> all the five brand positioning variables. The weights so obtained were labeled WB1-WB5. Similarly, 15 weights, labeled WE1-WE10, were obtained for all the ten ethic variables from the analysis of the conducted survey. Finally, the EPI score is calculated and arranged in descending order to obtain the EPI ...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{interesting}} thing about the way SimGolf works is the calculation of the skill rating of your course. There are three skills all golfers either have or don't have: length, accuracy, and imagination. Length {{is the ability to}} hit the ball a long way, accuracy the ability to hit the ball straight, and imagination is the ability to [...] "shape" [...] shots the way you want to and put spin on the ball. The skill rating of a hole is determined by <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> people with each skill compared to <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> people without each skill. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> people with length is 4, and without length is 4.5, you have a length rating of 4.25. The skill rating of your hole is the rating in all three categories added together, and the skill rating of your course is the ratings of all your holes added together.|$|R
