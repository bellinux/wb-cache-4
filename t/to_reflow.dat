50|$|The {{small size}} of the exposed contacts, and the large area of exposed thermal pad {{makes it easy for}} small parts, such as 3x3 mm DFN packages, to float on the pool of molten solder under the thermal pad during assembly. This causes the parts to make no contact to the printed circuit board pads in some instances. Due to the {{excellent}} thermal characteristics of this mounting package, {{it is very hard to}} rework the device, as hot air reflow typically does not offer enough heat to the thermal pad without damage to surrounding board material or parts. Oxidation of the exposed chip contact pads after being exposed to a reflow oven during initial assembly makes solder wetting to them during rework quite difficult. Additionally there is no clearance for a soldering pencil <b>to</b> <b>reflow</b> pads under the chip if touch up is desired. Sometimes contact can be made up the sides of the DFN package contact pads, but this does not work well in practice.|$|E

Recent developments in pen-based computing promise to bring this experience to digital documents. However, digital documents are more flexible than their paper counterparts. When a digital document is edited, or displayed on different devices, its layout adapts to the new situation. Freeform digital ink annotations made on such a document must likewise adapt, or "reflow. " But their unconstrained nature yields only vague guidelines for how these annotations should be transformed. Few systems have considered this issue, and still fewer have addressed it from a user's point of view.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} the modification of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) -induced thrombolysis by recombinant lys-plasminogen. Background. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator restores flow in the thrombosed coronary artery, but the artery often reoccludes. The rt-PA-induced thrombolysis {{is a result of}} activation of plasminogen bound to fibrin in the thrombus and results in generation of the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin. Small amounts of lys-plasminogen are formed when rt-PA is used. Lys-plasminogen binds to fibrin with a 10 -fold greater affinity than the predominant native glu-plasminogen, leading to a loose fibrin structure. Methods. Dogs with electrically induced occlusive intracoronary thrombus were treated with saline solution (n = 9), gluplasminogen (2 mg/kg body weight, n = 5) or lys-plasminogen (2 mg/kg, n = 5), followed by infusion of rt-PA (1 mg/kg over 20 min) 10 min later. Results. Reperfusion rates were similar in all groups of dogs, but the time <b>to</b> <b>reflow</b> was lowest in dogs given lys-plasminogen compared with those given saline solution or glu-plasminogen before rt-PA (mean [±SE] 14 ± 2 vs. 22 ± 2 and 23 ± 3 min, respectively, p 120 vs. 39 ± 7 and 82 ± 21 min, respectively, p < 0. 05). Plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 activity decreased during rt-PA infusion and thereafter increased in all dogs, but less so in dogs given lys-plasminogen (p < 0. 05 vs. those given saline solution before rt-PA). Conclusions. Treatment with recombinant lys-plasminogen before rt-PA reduces time <b>to</b> <b>reflow</b> and sustains reflow after thrombolysis, whereas glu-plasminogen has no such effect...|$|E

40|$|Reflow {{soldering}} in a nitrogen {{atmosphere is}} a common process consideration in surface mount technology assembly. This is because the use of nitrogen in reflow equipment may benefit the process as well as the quality of the end product, where it can increase the reliability of the solder joint. So far, many papers have reported effects of cooling speed, type of solder pastes and solder fluxes on the reliability of lead-free solder joints. While the effects of reflow conditions on intermetallic compound (IMC) formation at the solder joint such as the atmosphere during the reflow process are still unclear. The present study investigated thoroughly the effect of different reflow soldering atmosphere, which is air and nitrogen on IMC formation and growth. Several techniques of materials characterization including optical, image analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis will be used to characterise the intermetallics in terms of composition, thickness and morphology. In addition, the effects of cooling rate and isothermal aging were also studied for the solder alloy Sn– 4 Ag– 0. 5 Cu on electroless nickel/immersion gold (ENIG) surface finish. From the study, it was found that reflowing under nitrogen atmosphere had better effect on IMC formation and growth compared <b>to</b> <b>reflowing</b> under air.

40|$|A {{study on}} reflow {{soldering}} process for Sn 3. 5 Ag solder on ENIG substrate was performed using the {{rapid thermal processing}} (RTP) system. The reflow soldering process by RTP system can be successful, but it is sensitive to some typical defects. A poor RTP system design can lead to significant temperature differences where non-uniform heating or cooling may result in material failure due to increase in thermal stresses or serious damage. From this study, {{it was found that}} at a peak temperature (Tpeak) of 251 °C, the reflowed solder was observed to be smooth joint appearance over the solder pad and formed a regular joint shape of the solder due <b>to</b> the efficient <b>reflow</b> profile and sufficient heating input during the reflow process. The Ni 3 Sn 4 intermetallic compounds were found to be continuous, thus resulting in a good metallurgical bonding between Sn 3. 5 Ag solder and ENIG substrate. Meanwhile, an uneven reflowed solder and defect mechanism was detected at Tpeak of 246 and 260 °C.
