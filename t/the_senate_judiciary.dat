5|$|Attorney General George H. Williams {{administered}} the United States Department of Justice with slackness. There were rumors that Williams was taking bribes {{in exchange for}} declining to prosecute pending trial cases. In 1875, Williams was supposed to prosecute the merchant house Pratt & Boyd for fraudulent customhouse entries. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee had found that Williams had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation. Williams had also indiscreetly used Justice Department funds to pay for carriage and household expenses.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{resigned}} from the Advisory Council on October 25, 1894 {{to run for the}} Senate. He was elected in November 1894 and served continuously through 1904. During his tenure in the Senate, Brown served on the Council of State from June 23, 1895 through 1901, and on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary,</b> Coinage, and Foreign Relations committees. In November 1904, though nominated, Brown was not re-elected. There was talk of Brown running again in the general elections of 1906 and 1908, but in 1910 he was re-elected. Cecil Brown effectively retired from the Senate in May 1914.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} {{was held up}} by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, the chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee and a committed segregationist.

He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various {{proposals}} for Reconstruction. Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E

5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act.

5|$|Harlan's {{nomination}} came {{shortly after}} the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary) and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 {{by a vote of}} 71–11. He took seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by Joseph Edward Lumbard.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy and {{his wife}} Joan {{separated}} in 1977, although they still staged joint appearances at some public events. He held Health and Scientific Research Subcommittee hearings in March 1977 that led to public revelations of extensive scientific misconduct by contract research organizations, including Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories. Kennedy visited China on a goodwill mission in late December 1977, meeting with leader Deng Xiaoping and eventually gaining permission {{for a number of}} Mainland Chinese nationals to leave the country; in 1978, he also visited the Soviet Union and Brezhnev and dissidents there again. During the 1970s, Kennedy also showed interest in nuclear disarmament, and as part of his efforts in this field even visited Hiroshima in January 1978 and gave a public speech to that effect at Hiroshima University. He became chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee in 1978, by which time he had amassed a wide-ranging Senate staff of a hundred.|$|E
5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E
5|$|The library {{has been}} criticized for not {{including}} much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office. On January 20, 2001, his last day in office, Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading. Rich's wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton's presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee, in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions. It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon. Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought, but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich's appeal. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama referenced the donations during his primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, President-elect Taft {{announced}} his intent to nominate Senator Philander C. Knox to be Secretary of State. Shortly after the announcement, the Clause {{emerged as a}} problem that caught those involved by surprise: Knox had been elected to serve a term that would not end until 1911, and during that term Congress had voted to increase executive branch pay. Members of Congress considered reverting the fix after the appointed nominee had resigned and assumed the post so that Knox {{would not have to}} forgo any emoluments. Members of Congress also discussed reverting the salaries of all United States Cabinet members. At the suggestion of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, Congress passed a bill reducing only the Secretary of State's salary to the level it had been at before Knox's term began, believing this would cure the problem. The Senate passed the bill unanimously, but there was much more opposition in the U.S. House of Representatives, where the same measure failed to get a required two-thirds vote under a motion to suspend the rules and pass, a procedure normally reserved for uncontroversial matters. After a different procedural rule was applied, it passed by a 173–115 majority vote and President Roosevelt subsequently signed the bill. On March 4, the first Saxbe fix became effective when the salary of the Secretary of State (but not that of other Cabinet members) was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000. The Senate confirmed all of Taft's Cabinet appointees on March 5, and Knox took office on March 6.|$|E
