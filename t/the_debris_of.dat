5|$|It was {{discovered}} in <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E

Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E

5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him {{would have to be}} a much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Jupiter and Saturn {{are thought}} to have formed through co-accretion, a similar process to that {{believed}} to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's Galilean satellites, but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as Iapetus and Rhea, were formed from <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's orbital eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Macedonian architecture, {{although}} {{utilizing a}} mixture of different forms and styles {{from the rest of}} Greece, did not represent a unique or diverging style from other ancient Greek architecture. Among the classical orders, Macedonian architects favored the Ionic order, especially in the peristyle courtyards of private homes. There are several surviving examples, albeit in ruins, of Macedonian palatial architecture, including a palace {{at the site of the}} capital Pella, the summer residence of Vergina near the old capital Aigeiai, and the royal residence at Demetrias near modern Volos. At Vergina, the ruins of three large banquet halls with marble-tiled floors (covered in <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> <b>of</b> roof tiles) with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly 16.7 x 17.6m (54.8 x 57.7ft) demonstrate perhaps the earliest examples of monumental triangular roof trusses, if dated before the reign of Antigonus II Gonatas or even the onset of the Hellenistic period. Later Macedonian architecture also featured arches and vaults. The palaces of both Vergina and Demetrias had walls made of sundried bricks, while the latter palace had four corner towers around a central courtyard in the manner of a fortified residence fit for a king or at least a military governor.|$|E

40|$|Recently, <b>the</b> {{frequency}} <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow disaster has increased, {{which is}} one of the natural disasters during extremely heavy rainfall condition. This paper described the analysis method about deposition characteristics <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow using topographic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path. First, we observed topographic changes by differencing high- resolution LiDAR DEMs acquired before and after <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow event. We assumed that deposition on outside <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path was generated by movements due to <b>the</b> inertia <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flows. Then, we analyzed three topographic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path: slope in flow direction, transition angle of flow path, and <b>the</b> net efficiency(L/H) <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flows defined by the ratio of transport length(L) and elevation difference(H). We applied this method to Umyeon Mountain debris flow event in July 2011. The results showed that deposition on outside <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path due to <b>the</b> inertia <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flows was significantly related to <b>the</b> transition angle <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> flow path.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{accumulation}} <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> and drifts {{around a}} bridge pier can substantially modify the local scour pattern. These local accumulations influence the hydraulic structure, {{which results in}} a new scour configuration. As a result, the scour hole dimensions generally increase as debris accumulation increases. Moreover, the scour process is also affected by the roughness of the accumulation. This paper investigates the time-averaged flow field <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> accumulation at a cylindrical bridge pier and analyses <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> roughness on <b>the</b> flow field. Velocity fields were examined in the presence <b>of</b> different rough <b>debris</b> accumulations with a constant frontal area of 5 % of the total flow area. The data confirm <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> accumulation on <b>the</b> flow field compared with pilot tests. The flow field generally resulted in larger flow velocities and turbulence near the pier and in the pier wake. Finally, {{the data show that}} <b>the</b> roughness <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> accumulation affects <b>the</b> development of the boundary layer underneath <b>the</b> <b>debris,</b> <b>the</b> downflow intensity and the maximum observed velocities...|$|R

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) mechanical-based lithography attracts {{much attention}} in nanomanufacturing {{due to its}} advantages of low cost, high precision and high resolution. However, debris effects during mechanical lithography often lead to an unstable machining process and inaccurate results, which limits further applications of AFM-based lithography. There is a lack <b>of</b> a real-time <b>debris</b> detection approach, which is the prerequisite to eventually eliminating <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debris,</b> and <b>of</b> a method that can solve the above problems well. The ultrasonic vibration (USV) -assisted AFM {{has the ability to}} sense the machining depth in real time by detecting the phase shifting of cantilever. However, whether <b>the</b> pile-up <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> affect <b>the</b> phase response of cantilever is still lack of investigation. Therefore, we analyzed <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>debris</b> effect on force control mode and investigated the relationship between phase shifting and pile-up <b>of</b> <b>debris.</b> Theoretical analysis and experimental results reveal that <b>the</b> pile-up <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> have negligible effect on phase shifting of cantilever.
