5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by <b>the</b> <b>catcher,</b> the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, <b>the</b> <b>catcher,</b> squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of <b>the</b> <b>catcher,</b> all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind <b>the</b> <b>catcher.</b> Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E

5|$|The novel <b>The</b> <b>Catcher</b> in the Rye by J. D. Salinger plays a {{major part}} in the episode, as the South Park boys are {{inspired}} to write their own book when they feel Salinger's book does {{not live up to}} its controversial reputation. The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family from the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E
5|$|After the season, the Baseball Writers' Association of America named Posey the NL MVP. He won the Silver Slugger Award for <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> position. He won the NL Hank Aaron Award, and Miguel Cabrera of the Tigers won the American League (AL) award, {{marking the}} first time in history that World Series opponents won the award in the same year. He was named the NL Comeback Player of the Year, and he {{received}} the Willie Mac Award from the Giants' organization.|$|E

5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind <b>the</b> <b>catcher,</b> to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's <b>The</b> <b>Catcher</b> in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's <b>The</b> <b>Catcher</b> in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E

5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Alston {{managed the}} St. Paul Saints, a Dodgers Class AAA affiliate, to an 86-68 win-loss record. The team {{finished}} in third place, 14 games behind an Indianapolis Indians team managed by Al López. That year, Alston managed Campanella again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. The media {{was critical of}} Alston for playing Campanella; they said that <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers. The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and four of its players collected more than 90 runs batted in (RBI). The team finished in first place, half a game in front of Indianapolis. During the baseball off-season, Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hockey, Iginla played baseball {{as a young}} man and was <b>the</b> <b>catcher</b> on the Canadian national junior team. He credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he would not {{have had the opportunity to}} play sports at a high level if not for his grandfather's support. Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the right wing. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the Alberta Midget Hockey League in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.|$|E

5000|$|Catapult: The {{players were}} {{split into two}} groups: Aisha, Hillal and Shaun were tasked with sling-shooting balls into {{particular}} zones marked by particular amounts of money within an arc, where {{they were to be}} caught by Erin, Nick and Sam. There were also some [...] "dead zones", which, if the ball was caught within those zones by <b>the</b> <b>catchers,</b> would deduct money from the pot. However, to win <b>the</b> money, <b>the</b> <b>catchers</b> would have to catch the ball on the full (that is, without the ball bouncing on the field), to win that amount of money. The catching team managed to catch eleven balls, thus winning $10,000 for the pot. After this round, the players would swap roles; that is, the slingers would catch the balls whilst <b>the</b> <b>catchers</b> would be <b>the</b> ones slinging the balls from the ground. In the second round, the team earned $20,500, thus raising the total money in this challenge won up to $30,500.|$|R
