25|$|It {{was in the}} {{interests}} of the British <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>US</b> citizens aware of German actions and attitudes. One over-enthusiastic propagandist's fabricated story was circulated that in some regions of Germany, schoolchildren were given a holiday to celebrate the sinking of the Lusitania. This story was based on the popular reception given the Goetz medal (see below) and was so effective that James W. Gerard, the US ambassador to Germany, recounted it being told in his memoir of his time in Germany, Face to Face with Kaiserism (1918), though without vouching for its validity.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E

25|$|Eventually the U.S. and British {{political}} leadership reached a compromise {{in which both}} would commit most of their forces to an invasion of France in early 1944, but also launch a relatively small scale Italian campaign. A contributing factor was Franklin D. Roosevelt's desire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>US</b> troops active in the European theatre during 1943 and his attraction {{to the idea of}} eliminating Italy from the war. It was hoped that an invasion might knock Italy out of the conflict, or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it. The elimination of Italy would enable Allied naval forces, principally the Royal Navy, to dominate the Mediterranean Sea, securing the lines of communications with Egypt, the Far East, the Middle East and India. Italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the Balkans and France would be withdrawn to defend Italy, while the Germans would have to transfer troops from the Eastern Front to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the Soviets.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{voted against}} a 1983 {{resolution}} allowing President Reagan <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>U.S.</b> Marines deployed {{as part of}} the Multinational Force in Lebanon, on the grounds that he [...] " [...] not foresee obtainable objectives in Lebanon." [...] After the catastrophic Beirut barracks bombing a month later, this stance against his party and president gained him national media exposure and started his reputation as a political maverick. [...] McCain sided with Newt Gingrich's group of young conservatives in some of their battles against the House Democratic leadership, but declined to join Gingrich's Conservative Opportunity Society. [...] McCain felt personal affection for Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and established good relations with some Democrats in the House, such as Paul Simon and especially Mo Udall.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} favorable reviews. Brad Trechak of the TV Squad said of {{the episode}}: [...] "In the end, the episode was really good {{at the beginning and}} the ending, but the middle kind of dragged." [...] Eric Hochburger of TV Fanatic criticized the Mike Scioscia cameo, although he said that [...] "hile this week's installment will never replace our favorite Simpsons baseball episode, [...] "Homer at the Bat," [...] there [...] certainly plenty of great jokes and a strong enough story with heart <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> entertained." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club compared the episode favorably to [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] although he also criticized the Scioscia cameo, calling it [...] "awkward". In conclusion he gave the episode an A-, the best grade of the night.|$|E

The list also featured 12 [...] "policy makers" [...] that have [...] "the power <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>U.S.</b> government officials in Africa" [...] in order to work toward the capture of Kony.

500|$|Director Tom Hooper {{lets his}} actors shine, {{as he did}} so marvelously in Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I and the child-killer drama Longford, but he {{complements}} them, too, with this kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example – they're askew, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> out of the classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, [...] "The resolution carries," [...] the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment. The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by music critics. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the song {{four out of}} five stars and stated, [...] "Quiet storm gets a freaky sci-fi makeover". Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan commended Usher's collaboration with Diplo as [...] "a doubly satisfying departure from their respective strains of club-ready fare." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard called the song [...] "an ode to the bewildering thoughts and feelings of relationship purgatory" [...] and wrote that it is [...] "a sound that Usher should explore more often." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin felt that the song is [...] "as vividly communicative as it is decoratively beautiful" [...] and praised its articulation, calling it [...] "a tour de force of pacing and dynamics, giving listeners more and more, but then always easing up just enough <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> begging for one more verse." ...|$|E

500|$|Marta Hoelsher of Technorati Media said: [...] "The biggest news {{of season}} two, though, is the {{appearance}} of Donna Mills as Abby Cunningham, the blonde bombshell who wreaks havoc all through the neighborhood. With {{the appearance of}} Abby, things really started to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets her eyes on it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> loving and hating her for years. Abby's clashes with Karen MacKenzie and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling. After a fairly peaceful start to the season, we start to see {{the beginnings of the}} rivalry that defines the show for years: [...] Karen vs. Abby. [...] It's fun watching their early friendship evolve into a bitter rivalry." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European Elections. The BNP polled 943,598votes (6.2%), gaining two MEPs. Griffin and fellow MEP Andrew Brons were {{subsequently}} pelted with eggs as they attempted to stage a celebratory press conference outside the Houses of Parliament. A second venue– a public house near Manchester– was chosen the following day. A line of police blocked a large group of protesters, who chanted [...] "No platform for Nazi Nick" [...] and [...] "Nazi scum off our streets". Griffin viewed the election as an important victory, claiming that his party had been demonised and blocked from holding public meetings. [...] "In Oldham alone there have been hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on employing bogus community workers <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> out. To triumph against that level of pressure as a political party has never been done before." ...|$|E

He was out for an early morning walk and {{was hit by a}} truck. Thank you for the {{messages}} and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> in your prayers." [...] Carla Alcorn's post was subsequently deleted, and her Facebook account was made private. The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District. In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that [...] "Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident. A moment of silence was held in Alcorn's memory before a Kings High basketball game on December 30.|$|E
50|$|In his “Seven Faces” paper, Bullard argued {{it may not}} {{be prudent}} to rely on a near-zero policy rate alone <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>U.S.</b> out of the deflationary outcome; he {{recommended}} that current interest rate policy be supplemented with additional quantitative easing, an unconventional monetary policy tool.|$|R

500|$|When {{asked about}} the new project, drummer Rob Bourdon said, [...] "We tend to be perfectionists and it's sort of how we work. We {{like being in the}} studio and when we get in there we write a ton of material." [...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E
500|$|... "Essence" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that {{while much of}} the episode was a [...] "blur", it was nonetheless exciting. Handlen was complimentary towards the installment's [...] "tremendous sense of purpose [...] builds to a fever pitch that makes questions of who exactly wants what largely irrelevant." [...] While he offered a pessimistic opinion in regards to the series' mythology as a whole, Handlen concluded that the eighth season's sense of purpose, as exemplified in [...] "Essence", made the episode successful. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of Contra Costa Times praised the episode, writing [...] "where have nifty episodes like [...] been the last two years?" [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Praising the storyline, he noted that [...] "Thanks to 'Essence', I've become a believer again." [...] John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "overall, this was a wonderful episode that served to prepare us for the final installment of the alien mythology (presumably) and managed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> in our seats the entire way." [...] Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> engaged." ...|$|E

500|$|June {{started off}} {{as all the}} {{previous}} months had, with Dodd campaigning in New Hampshire and Iowa, but at the June 3 debate in Manchester he made a notable statement {{that led to a}} huge applause from the crowd. During the debate he pointed out a woman in the audience whose husband was fighting in the War on Terrorism, he thanked her for the sacrifice and stated the importance of standing up for America's security while on the campaign trail, [...] "No one is going to be elected president who is not going to have as their primary responsibility <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> safe and secure." [...] After the debate Dodd went back to the trails, but while campaigning he found a new tool to help spread his message. The campaign encouraged voters to confront politicians with video cameras and ask them to talk about Iraq and to support the [...] "Dodd Amendment" [...] which would have required American troops to start redeployment in 30 days. The final step was for the voters to post the interactions on YouTube. The Dodd campaign has used the internet more frequently than other campaigns, often airing staff meetings via the web. The campaign released a new advertisement on June 16 entitled [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] which focused on Dodd's time in the Peace Corps. As June came to a close Dodd made his final appearance of the month at a forum in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, the first time he visited the state which moved up its primary dates, causing a controversy with the DNC. On June 30 the campaign revealed the fundraising totals for the second quarter, Dodd raised $3,250,730, spent $4,384,580 and had a total of $6,378,271 cash on hand.|$|E
500|$|Desiring {{their own}} home stadium, in the early 1970s the Giants reached an {{agreement}} with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to play their home games at a brand-new, state-of-the-art, dedicated football stadium. Some New Yorkers were furious and Mayor John Lindsay had attempted to keep the team in the city by proposing to buy Yankee Stadium and renovate it at a cost of $24 million. Lindsay estimated that they brought $3 million to the city, and was anxious to keep that revenue, as well as satisfy New York Giant fans. Axthlem characterized the Giants fan base at the time as mostly [...] "white, suburban and fairly well to do, and its members drive cars to football games." [...] The battle became nasty with members of the New York City side claiming that the Maras [...] "complained of how inconvenient it was for them to park, or for them to get out to the neighborhood." [...] They claimed the Maras [...] "never really negotiated. They just listened...I think they were afraid if they asked for something, we might give it to them—and they wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> from offering a deal that they couldn't turn down." [...] In fact, the Maras had already made the agreement {{to move out of the}} city, even though Wellington was still placating the city. He felt this was a factor in the Mara's decision to move the stadium, as the attendees could drive to their New Jersey stadium as opposed to traveling through the Bronx to Yankee Stadium. The new stadium, which would become known as Giants Stadium, was to be built at a brand new sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The decision met with outrage from some New Yorkers, and the city's mayor John Lindsay sought legal action to prevent the team from playing in Yankee Stadium — or anywhere else in New York — and demanded a congressional investigation into the deal.|$|E
