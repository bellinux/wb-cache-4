5|$|Three works XJ220-Cs {{were entered}} in the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans race, in the newly created Grand Touring Class. John Nielsen, David Brabham and David Coulthard won the GT class, beating Porsche by two laps; the other two cars retired, both through engine failure. However, the class win was revoked when the Jaguar XJ220-C was {{controversially}} disqualified for failing <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> catalytic converters. The Jaguars had passed scrutiny and completed {{the first day of}} qualifying when senior steward Alain Bertaut complained that Jaguar were not running catalytic converters. The cars had been entered under the IMSA GT category and Bertaut claimed that they needed <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> catalysts. The cars ran in the race under appeal.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E

5|$|By 1932 the Cronulla tramway had closed. Competing bus {{services}} {{had begun}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> unrestricted competition, and the tram line {{by this time}} was so full with services that trams often ran late due to holdups at the crossing loops and passengers missed their connections at Sutherland. The line suffered large losses in its later years, {{and the effect of}} the Great Depression at the time forced it to cease its services, the last passenger service operating on 3 August 1931. The goods service continued until 12 January of the next year.|$|E
5|$|NC State went {{three and}} out after {{receiving}} the ball, and after Tech incurred a running into the kicker penalty on the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on offense at its 27-yard line. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a 10-yard rush. NC State recovered the ball, and the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech 40-yard line. On their first play after the fumble recover, Kramer completed a 12-yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> it, and Virginia Tech's defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense {{to return to the}} field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their 27-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the guineafowl.

Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E

5|$|By 1919, James {{had died}} in office and Governor Augustus Owsley Stanley was elected to his vacant seat. The {{divisive}} prohibition issue and recent Republican gains in the state made the Democratic gubernatorial primary of particular interest. Stanley {{was the leader of}} the party's anti-prohibitionists. Prohibitionists, led by former governor J. C. W. Beckham, did not support James D. Black, who became governor when Stanley went to the Senate and was seeking re-election. At the time of Black's election as lieutenant governor in 1915, he had sided with the prohibitionists; he was chosen <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> Stanley to balance the party's ticket, so the anti-prohibitionists did not entirely trust him either. Attempting to unite the party and prevent a Republican victory, Black invited Barkley, who had not been linked to either leader despite his support for prohibition, to be temporary chairman of the 1919 state Democratic convention. Barkley's convention address attacked Republicans and praised the Democrats' record without making reference to prohibition, but many in the Beckham faction refused to accept Black, and he was defeated in the general election by Republican Edwin P. Morrow. Chairing the convention introduced Barkley to state political leaders outside the First District.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles could not stand up to the demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{suffered}} {{their first}} {{defeat of the}} season {{at the hands of}} the San Francisco 49ers before a crowd of 70,385 in Cleveland. The 49ers led throughout the game, helped by three touchdown passes from left-handed quarterback Frankie Albert. Albert's main target was Alyn Beals, a former Santa Clara University star who caught two of his passes for touchdowns. Kicker Joe Vetrano added to the 49ers lead with a pair of field goals in the first half. Don Greenwood ran for a Browns touchdown in the second quarter, but the extra point was botched. The snap was high and went into kicker Lou Groza's arms. He tried <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> the ball but suffered a back injury when he was tackled short of the end zone. Cliff Lewis was also injured in the second quarter, twisting his knee badly. He was taken to a hospital. The Browns ran only 24 offensive plays in the first half, and the 49ers were ahead by 14 points by halftime. Despite losing 34–21, the Browns matched the 49ers statistically, with 338 total yards to San Francisco's 357. Marion Motley, who had been the AAFC's leading rusher before the game, was held to 22 yards.|$|E
5|$|The next {{batch of}} ballast motor cars were French-built gate stock cars, {{originally}} constructed in 1906, but converted {{in the early}} 1920s <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> the 1920 air-door stock. 20 motor cars were converted, but were replaced by more modern cars in 1930. Although 12 of the displaced cars were scrapped, six were kept as ballast motor cars, becoming numbers L24 to L29 in the service fleet. The final two were further converted to run as single cars on the Aldwych shuttle. During the Second World War they were used as pilot motor cars for refreshment trains on the Piccadilly line, which supplied food to people sleeping on the stations {{to escape from the}} bombing of the city. They returned to the Aldwych shuttle between 1946 and 1949, but were again used as pilot motor cars after that, transferring cars between the engineering works at Acton and various depots. They were both coupled to a flat wagon for a period, and were used to transfer stores from Acton Works to Northfields depot, and also took stores to Croxley Green and Queens Park depots on the Bakerloo line.|$|E

A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> a damaged sail and the one opposite removed without resulting in an unbalanced mill.|$|E
