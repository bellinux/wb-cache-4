5|$|During the {{dictatorship}} of Ferdinand Marcos, {{in accordance with}} Presidential Decree no. 645, the old Manila Hotel Company was liquidated and the government took over its ownership. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was given the mandate {{to form a new}} subsidiary corporation that would restore, renovate, and expand the Manila Hotel. In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants. During her visits, a red carpet and garlands were put out and the air was sprayed with deodorant. Under Imelda's patronage, the hotel reaped international recognition and awards. It was <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and be seen during the martial law years.|$|E
25|$|Hessilhead in its later {{days was}} {{occupied}} by the family of Lord Glasgow, and after they left, the proprietor, a Mr. Macmichael, about the year 1776, took off the roof and allowed <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to ruin. Circa 1887 - 92 it is described as being enclosed as a garden. Dobie records the despoiler of Hessilhead as a Mr. Carmichael, who sold the materials from the castle and also removed parts of the walls, as well as cutting down and selling an impressive old Yew tree. In the 1960s {{the remains of the}} castle were blown up on the instructions of Howie of Dunlop.|$|E
25|$|Melton {{has several}} pubs, some of which, like the Generous Britain (affectionately {{known as the}} Jenny B) {{continue}} to encourage new live music. The Noels Arms Freehouse is Melton Mowbray District CAMRA Pub of the Year 2014 and is <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for fine ales and cider. The Noels also houses Gasdog Brewery {{which is the first}} brewery in the town for over a hundred years. Also gaining great reputation for new and established bands and musicians in Melton Mowbray every Friday and Saturday night, Sunday afternoons sees the pub open to acoustic acts and the now very popular cheese board. There are several other pubs in Melton surviving the latest recession, including one of the oldest establishments in the area, The Anne of Cleves. This ancient building on Burton Street close to St Mary's church has features dating from the early 14th century. Originally home to Chantry Monks the building was taken during the dissolution and given, by Henry VIII to Anne of Cleves as part of the divorce settlement.|$|E

2500|$|The {{area around}} Madison Square {{continued}} to be commercially fashionable.

[...] He told me my low note changed his life. [...] He also folded my steel guitarist Fuzzy Owen in a rollaway bed and rolled him out on the street. [...] That was the pinnacle." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Western {{typically}} takes {{these elements}} and uses {{them to tell}} simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of John Ford or Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Specific settings include isolated forts, ranches and homesteads; the Native American village; or the small frontier town with its saloon, general store, livery stable and jailhouse and the open desert, {{where there are no}} structures and only windswept sand dunes. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the Wild West: it is <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for music (raucous piano playing), women (often prostitutes), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as Sergio Leone said, [...] "where life has no value".|$|E

60|$|This {{proposition}} {{took our}} hero by surprise. He was both flattered and pleased at the self-devotion of Ozema, even while it troubled him. Perhaps {{there were moments}} when he a little distrusted himself. Still Mercedes reigned in his heart, and he shook off the feeling as a suspicion that a true knight could not entertain without offering an insult to his own honor. On second thoughts, there were fewer objections to the scheme than he at first fancied; and, after an hour's discussion, he left <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and consult the admiral.|$|E

I went back to Mr. Blanchard's house. Before I got there, a sudden misgiving seized me, and I turned aside to the harbor. I was right; the harbor was <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to. A ship sailing for Lisbon that {{afternoon}} had offered him the opportunity of taking a passage {{for himself and his}} wife, and escaping me. His answer to my challenge had served its purpose of sending me out of the way into the interior of the island. Once more I had trusted in Fergus Ingleby, and once more those sharp wits of his had been too much for me.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think I {{know the}} reason for making the wall invisible," [...] she said after a while. [...] "The Flatheads use the stairs for coming down and going up. If there was a solid stone wall {{to keep them from}} {{reaching}} the plain they would themselves be imprisoned by the wall. So they had to leave some place to get around the wall, and, if the wall was visible, all strangers or enemies would find <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> around it and then the wall would be useless. So the Flatheads cunningly made their wall invisible, believing that everyone who saw the entrance to the mountain would walk straight toward it, as we did, and find it impossible to go any farther. I suppose the wall is really high and thick, and can't be broken through, so those who find it in their way are obliged to go away again." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{at last we}} {{approached}} the village of our destination, which bore the name of Himi, it was already dusk, and this with the long May twilight meant a late hour before we should be comfortably housed. Indeed, I had been quartered in anticipation {{for the last few}} miles, and was only awaiting arrival to enter into instant possession of my fancied estate. Not content even with pure insubstantiality, I had interviewed various people through Yejiro on the subject. First, the porters had been exhaustively catechized, and then what wayfarers we chanced to meet had been buttonholed beside; with the result of much contradictory information. There seemed to be an inn which was, I will not say good, but the best, but no two informants could agree in calling it by name. One thought he remembered that the North Inn was <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to; another that he had heard the Wistaria House specially commended.|$|E
60|$|The narrow inlets which I have {{mentioned}} go wandering {{out into the}} land everywhere and hiding themselves in it, and pleasure-launches are always exploring them with picnic parties on board. It is said by trustworthy people that if you explore them all {{you will find that}} you have covered 700 miles of water passage. But there are liars everywhere this year, and they will double that when their works are in good going order. October was close at hand, spring was come. It was really spring --everybody said so; but you could have sold it for summer in Canada, and nobody would have suspected. It was the very weather that makes our home summers the perfection of climatic luxury; I mean, when you are out in the wood or by the sea. But these people said it was cool, now--a person ought to see Sydney in the summer time if he wanted to know what warm weather is; and he ought to go north ten or fifteen hundred miles if he wanted to know what hot weather is. They said that away up there toward the equator the hens laid fried eggs. Sydney is <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to get information about other people's climates. It {{seems to me that the}} occupation of Unbiased Traveler Seeking Information is the pleasantest and most irresponsible trade there is. The traveler can always find out anything he wants to, merely by asking. He can get at all the facts, and more. Everybody helps him, nobody hinders him. Anybody who has an old fact in stock that is no longer negotiable in the domestic market will let him have it at his own price. An accumulation of such goods is easily and quickly made. They cost almost nothing and they bring par in the foreign market. Travelers who come to America always freight up with the same old nursery tales that their predecessors selected, and they carry them back and always work them off without any trouble in the home market.|$|E
