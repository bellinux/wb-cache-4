30|$|In conclusion, the {{conductive}} properties and the composition distributions are obtained simultaneously on same single QDs by CAFM measurements combined with NHH etching with a nanoscale trench. In particular, {{it should be}} noticed that, for highly GeSi mixed QDs grown at 680  °C, <b>the</b> NHH <b>etching</b> would form a thick oxide layer on the QDs’ surface, resulting in poorer conductance {{even more than the}} WL. This finding should be useful for similar etching experiments, as it has never been concerned previously. By adding a HF dipping after each NHH <b>etching,</b> <b>the</b> exact <b>composition</b> and current distributions as well as their correlation are obtained.

40|$|Studies of zircon grains using optical microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) {{have been carried out}} to characterize the surface of natural zircon as a function of etching time. According to the surface characteristics observed using an optical microscope after <b>etching,</b> <b>the</b> zircon grains were classified as: (i) homogeneous; (ii) anomalous, and (iii) hybrid. Micro-Raman results showed that, as <b>etching</b> time increases, <b>the</b> crystal lattice is slightly altered for homogeneous grains, it is completely damaged for anomalous grains, and it is altered in some areas for hybrid grains. The SEM (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, EDS) results indicated that, independent of the grain types, where the crystallinity remains after <b>etching,</b> <b>the</b> chemical <b>composition</b> of zircon is approximately 33 % SiO 2 : 65 % ZrO 2 (standard natural zircon), and for areas where the grain does not have a crystalline structure, there are variations of ZrO 2 and, mainly, SiO 2.

Regarding hybrid grains, we discuss whether the areas slightly altered by <b>the</b> chemical <b>etching</b> can be analyzed by the fission track method (FM) or not. Results of zircon fission track and U-Ph dating show that hybrid and homogeneous grains can be used for dating, and not only homogeneous grains.

30|$|Achieving {{constant}} {{process conditions}} {{is crucial for}} the industrial production of porous silicon. For two commonly used <b>etching</b> bath <b>compositions,</b> i.e., high HF concentration {{in the presence of}} ethanol and low HF concentration in the presence of acetic acid, we determined suitable analysis methods. The HF content of etching solutions without acetic acid can be analyzed by titration or F-ISE, respectively; whereas, for acetic acid containing solutions, only F-ISE is useful due to unwanted reactions of the acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. The cuvette test method can be used for both surface wetting agents.

30|$|It {{was found}} that the using of the {{surfactant}} in <b>the</b> <b>etching</b> step is much critical for the formation of the tubular nanostructure.
