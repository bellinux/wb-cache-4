40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted tilting pad bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. Babbitted tilting pad bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting pad bearing which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting pad journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is {{the elimination of the}} bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing,</b> the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting pad bearing over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting pad bearing design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{research}} facility {{has been designed}} and manufactured to study performance characteristics of industrial hydrodynamic thrust bearings. The facility includes a test rig containing two identical tilting pad thrust bearings operating against separate collars. A shaft supported by two journal bearings is driven by a 143 kW variable-speed d. c. motor. The bearings are tested in a balanced pair to accommodate the substantial axial force generated by hydraulic cylinders. Bearing instrumentation encompasses a distribution of thermocouples, pressure transducers and oil-®lm thickness sensors of eddy current type. Two piezoelectric transducers for pressure pro®le measurements and three thermistors are mounted {{in one of the}} shaft collars. Additional instrumentation includes thermocouples, pressure sensors, ¯owmeters, a load cell and inductive sensors. Signals from all sensors are logged by a personal computer-based high-speed data acquisition system that acquires the measured data, conditions them and presents the results on line. Power losses are obtained by monitoring bearing friction torque and by the calorimetric technique. A detailed description of the {{research facility}} is provided together with some representative results of equalizing <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> performance obtained for the steady state and transient operating conditions...|$|E

The effects of supporting condition of thrust pad on the lateral vibration of a hydroelectric generating set are investigated in this paper. The action of a thrust bearing is described as moments acting on the thrust collar, and the tilting stiffness coefficients of thrust bearing are calculated. A model based on typical beam finite element method is established to calculate the dynamic response, {{and the effects of}} supporting conditions such as elastic oil tank support, different heights of the thrust pads with rigid support are discussed. The results reveal that the influence of thrust bearing is small when the elastic oil tanks work normally. When the supporting conditions turn to be rigid due to the oil leakage, the differences of thrust pad heights have evident influence on the load distribution of the thrust pads; while the effects on the tilting stiffness of the thrust bearing and the amplitude of the lateral shaft vibration is small when the maximum load on thrust pads is smaller than the allowable value...|$|E

40|$|Oil-film <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are mainly}} used in {{supporting}} the high axial load of the turbine shaft in vertical hydroelectric units or smaller axial loads of turbo machines. The trend for these applications is to replace the white metal with a polymeric material layer such as PTFE or PEEK, improving the bearing performances and extending its operating conditions.

Significant improvement in load carrying capacity, wear resistance and friction coefficient of the tribiological mechanical component can be achieved by forming regular micro structure in form of micro dimple on the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> surface. In the present work numerical analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of spherical, cylindrical, elliptical, rectangular and square texture on the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> hydrodynamic <b>bearing</b> and a comparison is done with the plain <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> The above texture profile was chosen in the view to easy fabrication of such texture using laser technology or etching process.

This is because as texture height is increased it restricts the flow of lubricants which increases pressure and load carrying capacity.

However with very larger value of aspect ratio the roughness of surface decreases, which decreases the load carrying capacity.

One common modification is the hybridisation of plain <b>thrust</b> <b>pads</b> to allow hydrostatic operation {{to reduce the}} risk of bearing wipe at low speed (virtually all new installations benefit from this feature). A modification such as this is not a difficult undertaking; however, there are numerous factors that need to be considered in order to maximize bearing performance.
