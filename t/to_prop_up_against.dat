60|$|At last {{her father}} woke, and glad enough was she of his human company. They breakfasted upon some {{biscuits}} and water, and afterwards, while Mr. Clifford watched {{near the entrance}} with his rifle, Benita set to work to arrange their belongings. The tent she managed <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> {{the wall of the}} cave by help of some of the wood which they had carried in. Beneath it she spread their blankets, that it might serve as a sleeping place for them both, and outside placed the food and other things.|$|E
50|$|Marshal Tolbert had Christie's body {{strapped}} {{to the door of}} the fort and then loaded it into a wagon for the ride to Fayetteville and then to Fort Smith by train. Along the way, curious citizens flocked to the roads and train stations to view Christie's remains. The door to which Christie was attached allowed the deputies <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> him <b>up</b> <b>against</b> buildings so photographs could be taken. After Fort Smith, Christie's body was sent to Fort Gibson to be identified by his family and to be buried, but the remains were later moved to the Watt Christie Cemetery in Wauhillau, Oklahoma.|$|R
50|$|During {{the crisis}} the eastern provinces {{felt they were}} on their own, and were not {{inclined}} <b>to</b> help <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> Rome <b>against</b> foreign attacks. The Roman-Parthian wars were now the Roman-Sassanid wars. A Persian invasion starting in 236 in the reign of Gordian III (238-244) prompted Roman retaliation but in the ensuing battle to secure the eastern borders, the young Gordian was killed and amongst the terms made was the ceding of Armenia to Persia. Persia again attacked in 251, annexing Armenia and invading Syria in the reign of Trebonianus Gallus (251-253) but were eventually beaten off by the local Roman forces towards the end of his reign.|$|R
5000|$|The Countdown Clowns: These are tall, fat Meanies whose heads can spin {{round and}} round, and who shriek very loudly {{when ready to}} attack, or when they {{feel the need to}} alert other Meanies. If their noses are pressed, {{wherever}} they look there will appear an explosion. They have no hands or arms themselves, however, and so another Meanie has to press their noses for them, often needing <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> a ladder <b>up</b> <b>against</b> them, or sit up on their shoulders when doing so, because they are tall. When the Meanies' spell is broken, they end up simply producing positive words such as [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "OK" [...] in block capitals when they try to cause an explosion.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the year}} 1113 {{during the reign}} of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, {{according}} to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and [...] "a number of Franks had made their entrance therein". And they discovered [...] "(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", [...] "their shrouds having fallen <b>to</b> pieces, lying <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more". Similar information is given in Ibn al Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; [...] "In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver." [...] The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in the southern Levant, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.|$|R
50|$|Tensions {{between the}} Western Allies and the {{communist}} Eastern allies accelerated {{after the end}} of World War II, resulting in the Cold War between the Soviet-led communist East and the American-led capitalist West. Key events that began the Cold War included Soviet, Yugoslav, Bulgarian, and Albanian intervention in the Greek Civil War {{on the side of the}} communists, and the creation of the Berlin Blockade by the Soviet Union in 1948. China returned to civil war between the Western-backed Kuomintang versus Mao Zedong's Communists supported by the Soviet Union with the Communists seizing control of all of mainland China in 1949, creating the People's Republic of China (PRC). Direct conflict between the East and West erupted in the Korean War, when the United Nations Security Council, with the absence of the Soviet Union at the time of the vote, voted for international intervention in Korea to stop the civil war. The United States and other Western powers used the war <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> South Korea <b>against</b> Soviet and PRC-backed communist North Korea led by Kim Il-sung. The war ended in armistice and stalemate in 1953.|$|R
5000|$|The CIA {{believed}} that Mobutu {{was the key}} to stability in the Congo, but was also a useful pawn for the U.S. They collected intelligence and took covert action in order <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> his leadership <b>against</b> internal and external threats. For example, Congo faced the external threat from the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FLNC), a guerrilla force based in Angola. In a CIA memorandum from 1984, the capabilities and threats posed by the FLNC were discussed. The document mentions that, while the FLNC was ineffective, it could be rallied into a disruptive force in the future. The CIA worried that terrorist attacks carried out by the FLNC were so damaging to Mobutu's reputation that the [...] "election was moved forward to July by Mobutu in an effort to shorten the time available for opposition mischief-making." [...] Without Mobutu, the CIA believed the Congo would fall into chaos, and thus were inclined to do everything they could to keep him in power. The memorandum ends stating, [...] "We concur with the American Embassy's judgement that continued control of Kinshasa is the key to Mobutu's remaining in power and that disturbances in the hinterland pose a threat to Mobutu only if sustained".|$|R
500|$|The Suez Canal, {{opened in}} 1869, cut weeks and {{thousands}} of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. [...] Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, {{though some of the}} stock belonged to Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention. The Khedive governed Egypt under the Ottoman Empire; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the Eastern Question of {{what to do about the}} decaying empire governed from Constantinople. With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> the Ottomans <b>against</b> the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria. Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.|$|R
2500|$|The Caliphate lasted in {{the area}} until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it [...] "Castellion Saint Abraham". It was {{designated}} capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom and given, in turn, as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes, Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham. [...] As a Frankish garrison of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, its defence was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'. The Crusaders converted the mosque and the synagogue into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 {{during the reign of}} Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and [...] "a number of Franks had made their entrance therein". And they discovered [...] "(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", [...] "their shrouds having fallen <b>to</b> pieces, lying <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more".

Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver." [...] The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery which excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,'On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything'.|$|R
