5|$|In July 1889, the Metropolitan Police {{uncovered}} a male brothel operated by Charles Hammond in London's Cleveland Street. Under police interrogation, the male prostitutes and pimps revealed {{the names of}} their clients, who included Lord Arthur Somerset, an Extra Equerry to the Prince of Wales. At the time, all homosexual acts between men were illegal, and <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> faced social ostracism, prosecution, and at worst, two years' imprisonment with hard labour.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend from}} the {{discussion}} group, who uses the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying {{a friend of a}} friend has discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. <b>The</b> <b>clients</b> wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E
50|$|The Fairbairnian Object Relations {{therapist}} imagines {{that all}} interactions between <b>the</b> <b>client</b> and <b>the</b> therapist are occurring in <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> inner object relations world, {{in one of}} the three dyads. If <b>the</b> <b>client</b> thinks <b>the</b> therapist is wise and compassionate the therapist sees this as an interaction between <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> Libidinal Ego and Exciting Object. If <b>the</b> <b>client</b> is angry at the therapist for not meeting <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> needs, <b>the</b> therapist might see it as an interaction between <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> Antilibidinal Ego and the Bad Object. The therapist might ask <b>the</b> <b>client</b> if this particular interaction reminds <b>the</b> <b>client</b> of something from childhood.|$|R
50|$|When {{needing a}} ride, <b>the</b> <b>client</b> first calls <b>the</b> organization. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> must have his/her own carâ€”it {{is not a}} taxi service. An escort team of three {{volunteer}}s arrives. One volunteer, the 'escort driver', uses {{his or her own}} car to drive the other two volunteers to <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> location. <b>The</b> 'designated driver' volunteer then drives <b>the</b> <b>client</b> home in <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> own car. <b>The</b> third volunteer is the 'navigator', and drives with the designated driver and client, collecting any donation that <b>the</b> <b>client</b> should want to make, giving <b>the</b> <b>client</b> a receipt, and making conversation with <b>the</b> <b>client</b> so <b>the</b> <b>client</b> does not bother the driver. When the ride is over, the escort driver picks up the designated driver and the navigator.|$|R
5000|$|Dependency {{injection}} {{allows a}} <b>client</b> <b>the</b> flexibility of being configurable. Only <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> behavior is fixed. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> may act on anything {{that supports the}} intrinsic interface <b>the</b> <b>client</b> expects.|$|R
5|$|Fifty {{people are}} interviewed in the film, {{including}} investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project, and Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions {{says that all}} of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> who were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to Richard Young, its cinematographer and co-director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close. The version of the film that was aired by CNN International as part of the CNN Freedom Project was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, first-generation {{symmetric}} multiprocessing (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, {{referred to as}} SMP1. These clients used Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as {{at that time the}} GROMACS cores were not designed to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> performed well in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under Windows. On January24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable thread-based implementation.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{questions}} on the later years of Cairano's career {{is that of the}} completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino delle Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503, with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when delle Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518. The causes for the delay appear to have been, firstly, a commercial dispute between the jeweller and <b>the</b> <b>clients,</b> and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the work, even if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The documents are incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the terms of the contract.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with other}} forms of {{inversion}} of control, dependency injection supports the dependency inversion principle. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> delegates <b>the</b> responsibility of providing its dependencies to external code (<b>the</b> injector). <b>The</b> <b>client</b> {{is not allowed to}} call the injector code. [...] It is the injecting code that constructs the services and calls <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to inject them. This means <b>the</b> <b>client</b> code does not {{need to know about the}} injecting code. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> does not need to know how to construct <b>the</b> services. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> does not need to know which actual services it is using. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how <b>the</b> <b>client</b> may use <b>the</b> services. This separates the responsibilities of use and construction.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{substantial}} {{exceptions to the}} duty to report misconduct. First and foremost, where an attorney learns of the misconduct through a <b>client,</b> <b>the</b> duty of confidentiality to <b>the</b> <b>client</b> trumps <b>the</b> duty to report. The attorney must seek permission of <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to report <b>the</b> misconduct, and if the permission is not granted, the attorney may not report it. Moreover, if reporting the misconduct would harm <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> <b>the</b> attorney may not report it at all. For example, where a client who owns a restaurant tells his attorney, Jones, that a different attorney, Smith, suggested that <b>the</b> <b>client</b> bribe a health inspector, Jones may not report Smith's misconduct unless Jones first gets <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> permission. However, if <b>the</b> <b>client</b> reports that Smith not only made a suggestion that <b>the</b> <b>client</b> bribe <b>the</b> health inspector, but assisted <b>the</b> <b>client</b> in paying <b>the</b> bribe, then Jones may not report this at all because doing so would be harmful to <b>the</b> <b>client.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of a lawyer's job is developing and managing relationships with <b>clients</b> (or <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> employees, if <b>the</b> lawyer works in-house for a government or corporation). The client-lawyer relationship often begins with an intake interview where the lawyer gets to know <b>the</b> <b>client</b> personally, discovers <b>the</b> facts of <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> case, clarifies what <b>the</b> <b>client</b> wants to accomplish, shapes <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> expectations as to what actually can be accomplished, begins to develop various claims or defenses, and explains her or his fees to <b>the</b> <b>client.</b>|$|R
25|$|The activities, results/products and {{the process}} are documented. External reports are written and sent to <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> <b>The</b> <b>clients</b> are then able to adapt their {{requirements}} {{based on the information}} received through the reports. Furthermore, the service provider can adjust their plan or the implementation based on their findings in order to satisfy all the requirements stated in the SLA (including new requirements).|$|E
25|$|A PPM {{needs to}} explain how the model centres around clients, and {{conceptualisation}} of <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> that is in line with the philosophies of social work.|$|E
25|$|Bieber-BÃ¶hm favoured {{stronger}} {{legal action}} by the state against <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> of prostitutes. Pappritz and StÃ¶cker were both opposed to state surveillance and control of prostitutes.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} Java example, <b>the</b> <b>Client</b> class contains a Service member variable that is initialized by <b>the</b> <b>Client</b> constructor. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> controls which implementation of service is used and controls its construction. In this situation, <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{is said to}} have a hard-coded dependency on ServiceExample.|$|R
50|$|Plan some {{behavior}} {{that is likely to}} work better. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> is likely to need some suggestions and prompting from the therapist, but it helps if the plan itself comes from <b>the</b> <b>client.</b> It is important that the initial steps be small enough that <b>the</b> <b>client</b> is almost certain to succeed, in order to build confidence.In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> problem is <b>the</b> result of a bad relationship with someone, and since <b>the</b> <b>client</b> cannot change anyone else's behavior, the therapist will focus on things <b>the</b> <b>client</b> can do unilaterally. <b>The</b> <b>client</b> may be concerned that the other person will take advantage of this and not reciprocate, but in most cases a change in behavior will ease the tension enough that the other person also backs off. If this does not happen, the therapist will also encourage <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to build more positive relationships with other people. The relationship with the therapist sustains <b>the</b> <b>client</b> long enough for them to establish these other relationships.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the {{agreement}} between the insurers, once <b>the</b> <b>client</b> makes a claim or the insurer pays <b>the</b> <b>client</b> from his/her policy the insurer has to reinstate <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> No Claim Discount (NCD) hence, the claim won't and should not affect <b>the</b> <b>client</b> policy especially if that client was not at fault.|$|R
25|$|Differences ensued. One of {{the first}} was that Utzon {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> should receive information on {{all aspects of the}} design and construction through his practice, while <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.|$|E
25|$|He {{supported}} the Canadian government's efforts to tighten its laws concerning prostitution in 1994, {{saying that he}} especially favoured a proposal to impound cars owned by <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> of street prostitutes.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{according}} to the available data, 809,536 users (i.e. 60.6% of <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> connected the distribution network) were subsidized. Together, these consumers accounted for 10.6% of the total energy demand at the distribution level.|$|E
50|$|When DarkComet executes, {{the server}} connects to <b>the</b> <b>client</b> and allows <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{to control and}} monitor the server. At this point <b>the</b> <b>client</b> can use any of the {{features}} which the GUI contains. A beacon goes off from the server every 20 seconds which waits for a command from <b>the</b> <b>client.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>client</b> sends a CertificateVerify message, {{which is}} a {{signature}} over the previous handshake messages using <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> certificate's private key. This signature can be verified by using <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> certificate's public key. This lets the server know that <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{has access to the}} private key of the certificate and thus owns the certificate.|$|R
50|$|When {{practicing}} literomancy, <b>the</b> <b>client</b> puts up a subject, be it {{a single}} character or a name. The literomancer then analyzes <b>the</b> subject, <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> choice of subject or other {{information related to}} the subject, along with other information he sees in <b>the</b> <b>client</b> or that <b>the</b> <b>client</b> supplies {{to arrive at a}} divination.|$|R
25|$|On September 3, 1995, Sheen {{married his}} first wife, Donna Peele. That same year, Sheen was named {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> of an escort agency {{operated}} by Heidi Fleiss. Sheen and Peele divorced in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the course is simple: {{one of the best}} ways to {{understand}} someone is to put yourself in their shoes. So, a group of middleweight marketers take on the role of an advertising agency creative department. While agency Creative Directors take on the role of <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{upper limit}} for stratum is 15; stratum 16 {{is used to}} {{indicate}} that a device is unsynchronized.

50|$|Role reversal: <b>The</b> <b>client</b> {{is asked}} to portray another person while a second actor portrays <b>the</b> <b>client</b> in <b>the</b> {{particular}} scene. This not only prompts <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to think as the other person, but also {{has some of the}} benefits of mirroring, as <b>the</b> <b>client</b> sees him- or herself as portrayed by the second actor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>client</b> sends a CertificateVerify message, {{which is}} a {{signature}} over the previous handshake messages using <b>the</b> <b>client's</b> certificate's private key.

30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{requests}} <b>the</b> first segment, <b>the</b> <b>client</b> cannot calculate R, {{because it}} does not know Slast and Tlast. Moreover, a prolonged download time of the first segment leads to a longer start time for <b>the</b> <b>client</b> watching <b>the</b> video, which has a negative effect on <b>the</b> <b>clientâ€™s</b> QoE [15]. Therefore, the proposed scheme requests the lowest bit rate segment as the first segment, allowing <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to begin watching the video as quickly as possible.|$|R
25|$|Utzon {{was highly}} {{reluctant}} {{to respond to}} questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC). However, he was greatly supported throughout {{by a member of}} the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> wanted to change.|$|E
25|$|With no pension {{or regular}} salary from Harper's Bazaar, Brodovitch {{was faced with}} {{mounting}} hospital bills.

25|$|This clientâ€“server {{terminology}} the user's terminal {{being the}} server and the applications being <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> often confuses new X users, because the terms appear reversed. But X takes {{the perspective of}} the application, rather than that of the end-user: X provides display and I/O services to applications, so it is a server; applications use these services, thus they are clients.|$|E
30|$|Empathic improvising and reflection: the {{therapist}} playing to <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> or following <b>the</b> <b>clientâ€™s</b> input, {{in a way}} that articulates or restates <b>the</b> <b>clientâ€™s</b> apparent emotional state, to provide supportive and empathic confirmation.|$|R
50|$|Deriving {{itself from}} {{transactional}} analysis theory, reparenting seeks to treat {{problems associated with}} defective parenting. The theory of reparenting states that psychological problems due to defective parenting can be overcome by reforming the parent ego state of <b>the</b> <b>client.</b> This achieved by regressing <b>the</b> <b>client</b> {{to a state of}} mind that is vulnerable to new experiences, the child ego state. Once <b>the</b> <b>client</b> is in <b>the</b> child ego state, the therapist traditionally adopts the role as <b>the</b> <b>clientâ€™s</b> new parent and attempts to correctly reparent <b>the</b> <b>client.</b> <b>The</b> nature of reparenting by the therapist should be more positive and influence <b>the</b> <b>client</b> into adopting a healthier parent ego state, which ultimately negates the psychological problems <b>the</b> <b>client</b> may have experienced before reparenting therapy.|$|R
