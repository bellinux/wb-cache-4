5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|Eventually Kwajalein Island was selected, {{as it was}} 4,800miles from California, {{perfect for}} ICBMs, and already had a US Navy base with {{considerable}} housing stocks and an airstrip. The Zeus site, known as the Kwajalein Test Site, was officially established on 1 October 1960. As it grew in size, it {{eventually led to the}} entire island complex being handed over to the Army from the Navy on 1 July 1964. The site took up a considerable amount of the empty land to {{the north side of the}} airfield. The launchers were located on the far southwestern corner of the island, with the Target Tracking Radars, Missile Tracking Radars (MTRs) and various control sites and generators running along the northern side of the airfield. The ZAR <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> were some distance away, off the northeastern edge of the airfield.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} allow both range and bearing to be {{measured}} at the same time, separate antennas, receivers, amplifiers and displays were needed. The antennas were mounted on triangular trusses mounted rigidly to a wooden cabin, in turn mounted on an AA gun carriage bearing system which allowed the entire cabin to be rotated around the vertical axis. For tracking, the <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> cabins were both {{turned to face the}} general direction of the target. The result was an unwieldy system of some complexity.|$|E
25|$|The first {{experimental}} system, Duga, {{was built}} outside Mykolaiv in Ukraine, successfully detecting rocket launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome at 2,500 kilometers.

Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an operational system. The new Duga-1 systems used a <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> separated by about 60km.|$|E
25|$|The first American {{demonstration}} of Meucci's invention {{took place in}} Staten Island, New York in 1854.

Meucci claimed to have invented a paired electromagnetic <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver,</b> where the motion of a diaphragm modulated a signal in a coil by moving an electromagnet, although this was not mentioned in his 1871 U.S. patent caveat. A further discrepancy observed was that the device described in the 1871 caveat employed only a single conduction wire, with the telephone's transmitter-receivers being insulated from a 'ground return' path.|$|E

25|$|In comparison, LORAN was {{deliberately}} {{designed to allow}} skywaves to be used, and the resulting received signal was far more complex. The groundwave remained fairly sharp, but could be received only at shorter distances and was primarily used during the day. At night, as many as thirty different skywaves might be received from a single transmitter, often overlapped in time, creating a complex return pattern. Since the pattern depended on the atmospherics between the <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver,</b> the received pattern was different for the two stations. One might receive a two-bounce skywave from one station {{in the same time}} as a three-bounce wave from another, making interpretation of the display quite difficult.|$|E
25|$|Performance of cross {{interleaver}} : As {{shown in}} the above interleaver figure, the output is nothing but the diagonal symbols generated {{at the end of}} each delay line. In this case, when the input multiplexer switch completes around half switching, we can read first row at the receiver. Thus, we need to store maximum of around half message at receiver in order to read first row. This drastically brings down the storage requirement by half. Since just half message is now required to read first row, the latency is also reduced by half which is good improvement over the block interleaver. Thus, the total interleaver memory is split between <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E
25|$|Across the Atlantic in 1922, after {{placing a}} <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> on {{opposite}} sides of the Potomac River, U.S. Navy researchers A. Hoyt Taylor and Leo C. Young discovered that ships passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, Lawrence A. Hyland at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application as well as a proposal for further intensive research on radio-echo signals from moving targets to take place at NRL, where Taylor and Young were based at the time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{scenario}} in which a single source communicates with a single destination via a distributed MIMO transceiver is considered. The source operates each of the transmit antennas via finite-capacity links, and likewise the destination {{is connected to the}} receiving antennas through capacity-constrained channels. Targeting a nomadic communication scenario, in which the distributed MIMO transceiver is designed to serve different standards or services, <b>transmitters</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivers</b> are assumed to be oblivious to the encoding functions shared by source and destination. Adopting a Gaussian symmetric interference network as the channel model (as for regularly placed <b>transmitters</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivers),</b> achievable rates are investigated and compared with an upper bound. It is concluded that in certain asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes obliviousness of <b>transmitters</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivers</b> does not cause any loss of optimality. I...|$|R

To assist low altitude flight, a Honeywell radar altimeter with <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> in the canard wings was used. The aircraft was also fitted with a Decca Type 72 Doppler navigation radar. TILS (Tactical Instrument Landing System), a landing-aid system made by Cutler-Hammer AIL, improved landing accuracy to 30m from the threshold on the short highway airbase system. In order to effectively enforce Sweden's air space, the Viggen was integrated with STRIL 60 national defence system. The JA 37 Viggen was also equipped with a Garrett AiResearch digital Central Air Data Computer, modified from the unit used upon the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.|$|E
25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver,</b> the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E
25|$|Massive MIMO is a {{technology}} where {{the number of}} terminals is {{much less than the}} number of base station (mobile station) antennas. In a rich scattering environment, the full advantages of the massive MIMO system can be exploited using simple beamforming strategies such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), maximum ratio-combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF). To achieve these benefits of massive MIMO, accurate CSI must be available perfectly. However, in practice, the channel between the <b>transmitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>receiver</b> is estimated from orthogonal pilot sequences which are limited by the coherence time of the channel. Most importantly, in a multicell setup, the reuse of pilot sequences of several co-channel cells will create pilot contamination. When there is pilot contamination, the performance of massive MIMO degrades quite drastically. To alleviate the effect of pilot contamination, the work of proposes a simple pilot assignment and channel estimation method from limited training sequences.|$|E
