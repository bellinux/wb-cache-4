Hot Topics in Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry Vol. 5, The Nature of Biological Systems as Revealed by <b>Thermal</b> <b>Methods,</b> L?rinczy, D. (Ed.) Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp 217 - 251 The Nature of Biological Systems as Revealed by <b>Thermal</b> <b>Methods</b> is a guide for experiments using <b>thermal</b> <b>methods.</b> The Editor has used his many years of experience to create a unique resource that will enable others with a less mathematical background, to realize the beauty and power of this tool and {{to gain a better}} understanding of biological problems. Biological calorimetry (and of course thermal analysis) is of increasing interest and is not covered thoroughly in other resources. The methods presented are macroscopic, for the rather inhomogeneous material (micromethods are often not possible or not pertinent). This book will help beginners in the field of thermal analysis or calorimetry understand the principles of thermodynamics being applied to biological systems. Biological systems are highly organized and very complex. The water and the different types of weak interactions among the macromolecules make the interpretation of thermal events very difficult. This book includes examples how to handle such problems. The Nature of Biological Systems as Revealed by <b>Thermal</b> <b>Methods</b> is unique in that it: -has a broad spectrum, from molecules and biochemistry, tissues, and food, to whole organisms; -combines practical problems (food processing, quality control, thermal denaturation of proteins, plants and small insects, etc.) with concrete solutions and interpretation; -provides practical strategies and tools without 'dry physics and mathematics'; -initiates the application of <b>thermal</b> <b>methods</b> in new fields (e. g. medicine); -forces the reader to go into more detail of thermodynamics and thermal techniques; -simplifies communication between biologists, medical doctors and experts of thermal analysis. The book is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in thermodynamics, including practising professionals applying <b>thermal</b> <b>methods</b> to biological problems; researchers and graduate students beginning work using thermal methods; and specialists of thermal analysis starting work on biological problems. In addition, this book will be a useful resource for libraries and institutes as the only book covering quantitative thermal analysis of biological systems...|$|R

5000|$|The {{print engine}} {{can be taken}} from an {{industrial}} table top printer, {{it can be a}} specifically designed module that can be [...] "bolted" [...] onto an applicator or it can be a proprietary element constructed by the printer applicator manufacturer. A print engine’s primary function is to accept data from a computer and print the data onto a label for application. This printing can be accomplished using either the direct <b>thermal</b> <b>method</b> or the thermal transfer method. Both methods heat up very fine elements (up to 600 per inch) on a print head. Direct thermal burns the image onto the face of specially designed label stock. This is the preferred method for shipping labels and is also very popular in Europe. The thermal transfer process utilizes a ribbon coated with wax, resin, or a hybrid of the two. It is then heated and melted onto the surface of the label substrate. Thermal transfer is the most popular method in the United States. The printer knows what to print via data communication from an outside software package, much like common inkjet printers. The software delivers data formatted in a specific layout and the printer reads the format based on its own driver.|$|E
50|$|The {{first person}} to produce a {{practical}} <b>thermal</b> <b>method</b> was Marcel Grateau in 1872. He devised a pair of specially manufactured tongs, in {{which one of the}} arms had a circular cross-section and the other a concave one, so that one fitted inside the other when the tongs were closed. The tongs were generally heated over a gas or alcohol flame and the correct temperature was achieved by testing the tongs on a newspaper; if the paper browned slightly it was about right. The waving itself was safe if care was taken to keep the tongs away from the scalp. The procedure was to comb a lock of hair towards the operator, moving the comb slowly with one hand to maintain some tension, while applying the tongs to the hair successively down the lock of hair towards the point. Each time the tongs were applied, they were moved slightly in a direction normal to the lock of hair, thus producing a continuous flat or two-dimensional wave. Skill using the wrist could produce slight variations of the wave. Thus, Marcel waving produced a two-dimensional wave, by thermal means only and the change was produced by plastic flow of the hair, rather than by any chemical means. Because of the high temperature used, the process tended to degrade the hair. However, in spite of its drawbacks, forms of Marcel waving have persisted until today, when speedy results and low cost are important.|$|E

The direct <b>thermal</b> <b>method</b> {{is one of the}} thermal techniques which are used to produce semi-solid metal feedstock. In this experimental work, aluminium 7075 alloy was used.

In direct <b>thermal</b> <b>method</b> experiment, a molten 7075 was poured into a cylindrical copper mould at different pouring temperatures of 680 °C and 660 °C meanwhile the holding time of 20 s, 40 s and 60 s before quenched into room temperature water. The sample processed by the cooling rate of 0. 7 °C/s produced a large microstructure. The formation of a spheroidal microstructure was obtained with the combination of a suitable pouring temperature and holding time.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>methods</b> {{of various}} forms {{have been used}} to {{quantify}} carbonaceous materials. Thermal/optical carbon analysis provides measurements of organic and elemental carbon concentrations as well as fractions evolving at specific temperatures in ambient and source aerosols. Detection of thermally desorbed organic compounds with thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) identifies and quantifies over 100 individual organic compounds in particulate matter (PM) samples. The resulting mass spectra contain information that is consistent among, but different between, source emissions {{even in the absence of}} association with specific organic compounds. TD-GC/MS is a demonstrated alternative to solvent extraction for many organic compounds and can be applied to samples from existing networks. It is amenable to field-deployable instruments capable of measuring organic aerosol composition in near real-time. In this review, thermal stability of organic compounds is related to chemical structures, providing a basis for understanding thermochemical properties of carbonaceous aerosols.

Epinephrine (1 : 10, 000), absolute ethanol, and 1 % polidocanol were used as injection solutions. In acute, severely bleeding experimental ulcers {{as well as in}} transected submucosal arteries, injection methods were not as effective as <b>thermal</b> <b>methods</b> in achieving complete hemostasis, although injection therapy, especially with large volumes of epinephrine (1 : 10, 000), very quickly decreased the rate of bleeding.
