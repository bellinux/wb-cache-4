5|$|Ashina She'er's {{soldiers}} were organized in five columns. The Tang army bypassed Karasahr and struck at Kucha {{from the north}} by moving through the Dzungarian Basin, which was {{the territory of the}} Chuyue (possibly Chigil) and Chumi, two Turkic tribes allied with the oasis state. The Tang army defeated the Chuyue and Chumi before entering the Tarim Basin, upon which the king of Karasahr fled his capital city and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> defensible position in Kucha's eastern territories. Ashina She'er's forces pursued the Karasahr king, took him captive, and then executed him.|$|E
5|$|Altgens <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> good camera {{angle on}} the bridge, but uniformed police {{said it was}} private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same}} time as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|By 23:30 on her own, Moltke {{encountered}} four British dreadnoughts, {{from the}} rear division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. Moltkes commander Kapitän von Karpf ordered the ship to swing away, hoping {{he had not been}} detected. The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, Kapitän von Karpf <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape.|$|E

5|$|Following the goal, Independiente under {{instruction}} from their manager José Pastoriza, began {{to sit back}} in their own half inviting Liverpool to attack them. Their plan worked as Liverpool were unable to break down their defence, while their strikers Percudani and Alejandro Barberón counter-attacked when Independiente received the ball. The second half saw Liverpool continue to attack the Independiente goal, but to no avail. Midfielders John Wark and Mølby <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way through the Independiente defence was equal to their efforts. Wark's efforts trying to engineer an equalising goal resulted in him being substituted for Ronnie Whelan in the 76th minute, due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> {{way back}} into the match. With 16 minutes left, Whelan was brought down in the Juventus penalty area by Massimo Bonini, but the referee decided {{that it was not a}} foul. Liverpool created more chances near the end of the match; Tacconi saved a shot from Whelan. Wark and Steve Nicol saw headers go wide of the Juventus goal. No further goals were scored and at {{full-time}} the score was 1–0 to Juventus, who had won their first European Cup and became the first club to win all three seasonal UEFA competitions.|$|E
5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he always <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because {{of the death of}} his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E

5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen {{had a tendency to}} darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} many letters and treatises. Following the Responsio ad Sadoletum, Calvin wrote {{an open letter}} {{at the request of}} Bucer to Charles V in 1543, Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem, {{defending}} the reformed faith. This was followed by an open letter to the pope (Admonitio paterna Pauli III) in 1544, in which Calvin admonished Paul III for depriving the reformers of any prospect of rapprochement. The pope proceeded to open the Council of Trent, which resulted in decrees against the reformers. Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto in 1547. When Charles <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> compromise solution with the Augsburg Interim, Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond. He wrote the treatise, Vera Christianae pacificationis et Ecclesiae reformandae ratio in 1549, in which he described the doctrines that should be upheld, including justification by faith.|$|E

5|$|Docherty {{found work}} as a {{domestic}} servant {{at the age of}} 14, before moving on to working in a factory. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> job after returning from Russia, but her travel there meant that people were unwilling to employ her. Thus she sold firewood along with her father for a while. She eventually found work at the Leith Hospital as a cleaner, because that job did not require references. She then worked as a servant for five years, before leaving to attend to her mother, who was ill. Back in Fife, she worked as an assistant to a dentist. She stated later in life that when she attended rallies with the communist party, she had to lie to her employers about where she went. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she began working in the Crombie munitions factory, before shifting to looking after children in Rosyth. The final job she held was at a cooperative bakery. She continued her work for the Communist Party while holding all of these positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} begins {{six weeks after}} the end of the first, where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley, whom the Cabal {{transformed}} to a vampire-hybrid superabnormal, one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network. When the superabnormals arrive at the Old City Sanctuary, Magnus is able to get through to Ashley, who recognises her in time to save her from another superabnormal, and then teleports. Because an electromagnetic field is active, it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized. Despite this, Magnus believes Ashley's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field's buffer. When it does not, she is forced to accept that Ashley has died. Because of her death, and other loved ones because of her longevity, she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to age at a normal rate again. She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras, but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie-like creatures. After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir's release by an incorporeal guardian, she decides to leave it behind.|$|E

25|$|With {{the death}} of Abu Talib, the {{leadership}} of the clan of Banu Hashim was passed to Abu Lahab who was an inveterate enemy of Muhammad. Soon afterwards Abu Lahab withdrew the clan's protection from Muhammad. This placed Muhammad in mortal danger since the withdrawal of clan protection implied that the blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> protector for himself in another important city in Arabia, Ta'if, but his effort failed and further brought him into physical danger. Muhammad was forced to return to Mecca. A Meccan man named Mut'im ibn Adi and the protection of the tribe of Banu Nawfal made it possible for him safely to re-enter his native city.|$|E
25|$|Response–stimulus {{interval}} (RSI) {{is another}} form of data {{that is used to}} quantify negative priming. RSI is the time difference between the response to prime target and the onset of probe trial. Negative priming effects are observed for delays of 20 millisecond to 8000 millisecond between the prime trial and the probe trial. Several experiments found that negative priming decays rapidly during this delay between prime and probe trials. Many studies have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> rate of this decay but have not been successful. Researchers of both the distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model use varying results of the RSI effects to justify the decay as a part of their model. More globally accepted {{research is needed to determine}} concrete RSI data and establish short-term and long-term negative priming limits.|$|E
