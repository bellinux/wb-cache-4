40|$|The juxtacapsular {{nucleus of}} the {{anterior}} division of the BNST (jcBNST) receives robust glutamatergic projections from the basolateral {{nucleus of the}} amygdala (BLA), the postpiriform transition area, and the insular cortex as well as dopamine (DA) inputs from the midbrain. In turn the jcBNST sends GABAergic projections to the medial division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEAm) {{as well as other}} brain regions. We recently described a form of long-term potentiation of the intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) of neurons of the juxtacapsular nucleus of BNST (jcBNST) in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the stria terminalis <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> protracted withdrawal from alcohol, cocaine, and heroin and in rats chronically treated with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) intracerebroventricularly. Here we show <b>that</b> DAergic neurotransmission <b>is</b> required for the induction of LTP-IE of jcBNST neurons through dopamine (DA) D 1 receptors. Thus, activation of the central CRF stress system and altered DAergic neurotransmission during protracted withdrawal from alcohol and drugs of abuse may contribute to the disruption of LTP-IE in the jcBNST. Impairment of this form of intrinsic neuronal plasticity in the jcBNST could result in inadequate neuronal integration and reduced inhibition of the CEA, contributing to the negative affective state that characterizes protracted abstinence in post-dependent individuals. These results provide a novel neurobiological target for vulnerability to alcohol and drug dependence...|$|R

In Poland, similarly to other developed countries, cardiovascular diseasesare {{the main cause of}} death in women after 50 years of age. Menopause not only induces an increase ofblood pressure, but is also an independent risk factor of cardiovascular complications, especially strokes whenhypertension coexists. The analysis of patients after 64 years of age revealed the prevalence of hypertensionin 81 % of women and 66 % of men. Hypertension {{is one of the most}} important risk factors of coronary arterydisease; in hypertensive women, the risk of development of different cardiovascular complications is 4 timeshigher than in coeval men. Menopause provokes also increased development of atherosclerosis. Cardiovascularrisk factors become more often assessed as the elements of the metabolic syndrome. Some of previous clinicaltrials undermined the positive influence of the treatment of mild hypertension in women because of a lowerrelative risk in this group. The INDANA analysis showed a great absolute benefit of treatment of hypertensionin older women as well as in black people in comparison to men. The decision concerning therapy in younger kobiewomen,especially in Caucasians, has to be made individually depending on the level of the cardiovascularrisk. Diuretics are preferably used in treatment of hypertensive women because of their additional advantage;they have a positive impact on calcium balance <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> menopause.

Previous work with conventional lesions has established that the dorsal hippocampus is essential for both the acquisition and expression of memory in this task.

40|$|International audienceIt <b>is</b> {{commonly}} believed <b>that</b> vision <b>is</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> saccadic eye movements. However, here {{we report}} that some visual stimuli are clearly visible during saccades, and trigger a constriction of the eye's pupil. Participants viewed sinusoid gratings that changed polarity 150 times per second (every 6. 67 ms). At this rate of flicker, the gratings were perceived as homogeneous surfaces while participants fixated. However, the flickering gratings contained ambiguous motion: rightward and leftward motion for vertical gratings; upward and downward motion for horizontal gratings. When participants made a saccade perpendicular to the gratings' orientation (e. g., a leftward saccade for a vertical grating), the eye's peak velocity matched the gratings' motion. As a result, the retinal image was approximately stable {{for a brief moment}} during the saccade, and this gave rise to an intrasaccadic percept: A normally invisible stimulus became visible when eye velocity was maximal. Our results confirm and extend previous studies by demonstrating intrasaccadic perception using a reflexive measure (pupillometry) that does not rely on subjective report. Our results further show that intrasaccadic perception affects all stages of visual processing, from the pupillary response to visual awareness...|$|R

We tested the hypothesis that muscle proprioceptor function is compromised in a mouse model of diet induced obesity. We used an in vitro muscle-nerve preparation to record muscle spindle afferent responses to physiological stretch and sinusoidal vibration. We compared the responses of mice on a control diet (10 % kcal fat) with those eating a high fat diet (60 % kcal fat) alone or in combination with either aspirin (120 mg/kg/day in drinking water) or rosiglitazone (0. 01 % in chow) for 10 weeks. Following high fat diet feeding, adult mice exhibited decreased muscle spindle afferent responses to stretch and lower dynamic sensitivity. Treatment with aspirin or rosiglitazone did not completely rescue muscle spindle afferent responsiveness. Due to the importance of muscle spindle afferents to proprioception and motor control, decreased muscle spindle afferent responsiveness may contribute to balance instability during obesity. Future studies should test this hypothesis in the human population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) is the transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Impairments in semantic memory {{have been demonstrated}} to be {{a critical factor in}} early AD. The Boston Naming Test (BNT) is a straightforward method of examining semantic or visuo-perceptual processing and therefore represents a potential diagnostic tool. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine naming ability and identify error types in patients with amnestic mild {{cognitive impairment}} (aMCI). Methods: Twenty aMCI patients, twenty AD patients and twenty-one normal controls, matched by age, sex and education level were evaluated. As part of a further neuropsychological evaluation, all subjects performed the BNT. A comprehensive classification of error types was devised in order to compare performance and ascertain semantic or perceptual origin of errors. Results: AD patients obtained significantly lower total scores on the BNT than aMCI patients and controls. aMCI patients did not obtain significant differences in total scores, but showed significantly higher semantic errors compared to controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} and emphysema are life-threatening diseases {{resulting from}} impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth {{and contribute to}} alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human fetal and neonatal rat lungs contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal lung ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth-arrested rat lungs mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human cord blood-derived ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored lung function, alveolar and lung vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. Lung ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored. Low ECFC engraftment and the protective effect of cell-free ECFC-derived conditioned media suggest a paracrine effect. Long-term (10 months) assessment of ECFC therapy showed no adverse effects with persistent improvement in lung structure, exercise capacity, and pulmonary hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired ECFC function may contribute to arrested alveolar growth. Cord blood-derived ECFC therapy may offer new therapeutic options for lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage...|$|R

Here we show that voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv) expression <b>is</b> <b>impaired</b> in the brain of tumor-bearing animals. Expression of both delayed rectifier (Kv 1. 1, Kv 1. 2, Kv 1. 3, Kv 1. 5, Kv 1. 6, Kv 2. 1, Kv 3. 1, Kv 4. 2) and A-type potassium channels (Kv 1. 4, Kv 3. 3, Kv 3. 4) was greatly down-regulated in brain from animals bearing a Yoshida AH- 130 ascites hepatoma.

Thirteen patients were studied within the first 2 days of an episode of cerebral ischemia ("acute " group); 11 were studied from 15 days to several months after an ischemic episode ("chronic " group). Measurements of regional {{cerebral blood flow}} (rCBF) were made by recording extracranially in four to six locations the clearance of 85 Kr dissolved in saline and injected into the internal carotid artery. Blood flow values were calculated with a digital computer, using a compartmental analysis of the clear-ance curves. After measuring rCBF in the resting state, the blood pressure was increased by 30 to 40 mm Hg by the intravenous infusion of angiotensin amide (Hypertensin, Ciba). While the blood pressure was kept constant at the new level, a second series of measurements was made. Autoregulation was present in all normal subjects: {{no significant differences were}} found in average or compartmental flow rates between values obtained at normal and at hypertensive levels of blood pressure. Loss of autoregulation was demonstrated in 10 of 13 patients of the "acute " group and in two of 11 patients of the "chronic " group. These data support previous observa-tions <b>that</b> autoregulation <b>is</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> the first few days after an ischemic episode. The three patients of the "acute " group with a preserved autoregulatory response to hypertension had only transient ischemic attacks. In each of the other subjects of this group loss of autoregulation was found in one to three different regions of the brain. Our results suggest that regional loss of autoregulation is found frequently near the periphery of the ischemic brain.

40|$|Drivers' {{ability to}} react to {{unpredictable}} events deteriorates when exposed to highly predictable and uneventful driving tasks. Highway design reduces the driving task mainly to a lane-keeping manoeuvre. Such a task is monotonous, providing little stimulation and this contributes to crashes due to inattention. Research has shown that driver's hypovigilance can be assessed with EEG measurements and <b>that</b> driving performance <b>is</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> prolonged monotonous driving tasks. This paper aims to show that two dimensions of monotony - namely road design and road side variability - decrease vigilance and impair driving performance. This is the first study correlating hypovigilance and driver performance in varied monotonous conditions, particularly on a short time scale (a few seconds). We induced vigilance decrement as assessed with an EEG during a monotonous driving simulator experiment. Road monotony was varied through both road design and road side variability. The driver's decrease in vigilance occurred due to both road design and road scenery monotony and almost independently of the driver's sensation seeking level. Such impairment was also correlated to observable measurements from the driver, {{the car and the}} environment. During periods of hypovigilance, the driving performance impairment affected lane positioning, time to lane crossing, blink frequency, heart rate variability and non-specific electrodermal response rates. This work lays the foundation for the development of an in-vehicle device preventing hypovigilance crashes on monotonous roads...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether diabetes-induced oxidant stress affects the contribution of nitroxyl (HNO) to endothelium-dependent relaxation in the rat aorta. Organ bath techniques were employed to determine vascular function of rat aorta. Pharmacological tools (3 mM l-cysteine, 5 mM 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP), 200 Î¼M carboxy-PTIO and 100 Î¼M hydroxocobalamin, HXC) were used to distinguish between NO and HNO-mediated relaxation. Superoxide anion levels were determined by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. In the diabetic aorta, where there is increased superoxide anion production, responses to the endothelium-dependent relaxant ACh were not affected when the contribution of NO to relaxation was abolished by either HXC or carboxy-PTIO, indicating a preserved HNO-mediated relaxation. Conversely, when the contribution of HNO was inhibited with l-cysteine or 4 -AP, the sensitivity and maximum relaxation to ACh was significantly decreased, suggesting that the contribution of NO <b>was</b> <b>impaired</b> by diabetes. Furthermore, whereas HNO appears to be derived from eNOS in normal aorta, in the diabetic aorta it may also arise from an eNOS-independent source, perhaps derived from nitrosothiol stores. Similarly, exposure to the superoxide anion generator, pyrogallol (100 Î¼M) significantly reduced the sensitivity to the NO donor, DEANONOate and ACh-induced NO-mediated relaxation but had no effect on responses to the HNO donor, Angeli&# 039;s salt and ACh-induced HNO-mediated relaxation in the rat aorta.

40|$|Roberts {{syndrome}} (RBS) is a {{human disease}} characterized by defects in limb and craniofacial development and growth and mental retardation. RBS is caused by mutations in ESCO 2, a gene which encodes an acetyltransferase for the cohesin complex. While the essential role of the cohesin complex in chromosome segregation has been well characterized, it plays additional roles in DNA damage repair, chromosome condensation, and gene expression. The developmental phenotypes of Roberts syndrome and other cohesinopathies suggest <b>that</b> gene expression <b>is</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> embryogenesis. It <b>was</b> previously reported <b>that</b> ribosomal RNA production and protein translation <b>were</b> <b>impaired</b> in immortalized RBS cells. It <b>was</b> speculated <b>that</b> cohesin binding at the rDNA was important for nucleolar form and function. We have explored the hypothesis that reduced ribosome function contributes to RBS in zebrafish models and human cells. Two key pathways that sense cellular stress are the p 53 and mTOR pathways.

Nucleoli, the sites of ribosome production, are highly fragmented in RBS cells. We tested the effect of inhibiting p 53 or stimulating mTOR in RBS cells. The rescue provided by mTOR activation was more significant, with activation rescuing both cell division and cell death.

Two new studies contribute {{to our understanding of}} the role that T reg cells play in the control of allergic airway disease in mice. However, these studies also highlight several outstanding questions in the field. Human disease versus animal models Human allergic airway disease is a complex condition characterized by increased amounts of systemic IgE, elevated allergen-specific T helper (Th) 2 cells and their products, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and structural changes in the lung. Animal models of both acute and chronic allergic airway responses have been described, although none of these models captures all aspects of human disease (1). Nonetheless, animal models have provided invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms of allergic airway disease, including the role of Th 2 cytokines in disease pathology and, more recently, the role of regulatory pathways in the control of disease. These models thus provide an important preclinical tool for dissecting the biological mechanisms involved in the sensitization to allergens and the effector mechanisms associated with disease, as well as for the investigation of novel therapies for human disease. Regulatory T cells T reg cells control peripheral immune responses and are likely to play a central role in determining the incidence and severity of several immune pathologies, including autoimmune, infectious, allergic, and asthmatic diseases (2). One eventual hope for the treatment of allergic airway disease, as for other immune-mediated pathologies, is to design therapies that boost endogenou...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Disadvantages {{related to}} CO 2 {{pneumoperitoneum}} {{have led to}} development of the abdominal wall retractor (AWR), a device designed to facilitate laparoscopic surgery without conventional pneumoperitoneum (15 mmHg CO 2). We investigated {{the effects of the}} AWR on hemodynamics and gas exchange in humans. We also investigated whether the use of an AWR imposed extra technical difficulties for the surgeon. A pilot study revealed that cholecystectomy without low-pressure pneumoperitoneum was technically impossible. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial: Twenty patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly allocated into group 1 : AWR with low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (5 mmHg), or group 2 : conventional pneumoperitoneum (15 mmHg). RESULTS: Surgery using the AWR lasted longer, 72 +/- 16 min (mean +/- SD) vs 50 +/- 18 min compared with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were no differences between the groups with respect to hemodynamic parameters, although a small reduction of the cardiac output was observed using conventional pneumoperitoneum (from 3. 9 +/- 0. 7 to 3. 2 +/- 1. 1 l/min) and an increase during AWR (from 4. 2 +/- 0. 9 to 5. 2 +/- 1. 5 l/min). Peak inspiratory pressures were significantly higher during conventional pneumoperitoneum compared to AWR. A slight decrease in pH accompanied by an increase in CO 2 developed during pneumoperitoneum and during the use of the AWR. In both groups arterial PO 2 decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate <b>that</b> the view <b>was</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> use of the AWR and therefore its use was difficult and time-consuming.

40|$|Heterotrophy {{is known}} to stimulate {{calcification}} of scleractinian corals, possibly through enhanced organic matrix synthesis and photosynthesis, and increased supply of metabolic DIC. In contrast to the positive long-term effects of heterotrophy, inhibition of calcification has been observed during feeding, which {{may be explained by}} a temporal oxygen limitation in coral tissue. To test this hypothesis, we measured the short-term effects of zooplankton feeding on light and dark calcification rates of the scleractinian coral Galaxea fascicularis (n= 4) at oxygen saturation levels ranging from 13 to 280 %. Significant main and interactive effects of oxygen, heterotrophy and light on calcification rates were found (three-way factorial repeated measures ANOVA, p< 0. 05). Light and dark calcification rates of unfed corals were severely affected by hypoxia and hyperoxia, with optimal rates at 110 % saturation. Light calcification rates of fed corals exhibited a similar trend, with highest rates at 150 % saturation. In contrast, dark calcification rates of fed corals were close to zero under all oxygen saturations. We conclude that oxygen exerts a strong control over light and dark calcification rates of corals, and propose that in situ calcification rates are highly dynamic. Nevertheless, the inhibitory effect of heterotrophy on dark calcification appears to be oxygen-independent. We hypothesize <b>that</b> dark calcification <b>is</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> zooplankton feeding by a temporal decrease of the pH and aragonite saturation state of the calcifying medium, caused by increased respiration rates. This may invoke a transient reallocation of metabolic energy to soft tissue growth and organic matrix synthesis.

50|$|While {{studying}} at Colombia, Leta Stetter Hollingworth {{became interested in}} the misconceptions about women <b>that</b> seemed to <b>be</b> a part of the zeitgeist. Thorndike agreed to supervise her dissertation on functional periodicity, which focused on the idea <b>that</b> women <b>are</b> psychologically <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> menstruation. Thorndike greatly influenced the work of Leta Hollingworth as he was a supporter of the variability hypothesis. The variability hypothesis postulated that, because men exhibit a greater variation in both psychological and physical traits than women, women were destined for mediocrity while men both occupied the highest and lowest ends of the range on any given trait (Shields 1982). Hollingworth set out to prove that the variability hypothesis <b>was</b> incorrect and <b>that</b> the extremes <b>were</b> not based on a male genetic superiority, instead extremes were culturally-based. She believed that rather than innate differences, societal roles accounted for the sex differences in the numbers of institutionalized males and females at the Clearing House for Mental Defectives. Although the research of Hollingworth conflicted with the direct interests of Thorndike, she completed her doctorate dissertation beneath his supervision. Her dissertation addressed the previously supported concept of women’s mental incapacity during their monthly menstruations. For the study, she recorded the results of both women’s and men’s performances on a variety of cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks daily for three months. No empirical evidence of a decreased performance with a phase of the menstrual cycle was found.

The thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 5 mu M) {{was added to the}} culture medium 30 min before sampling of the cells, which occurred 1 - 17 h after seeding. Using flow cytometry, coupled with an indirect immunofluorescence technique, which utilized monoclonal BrdUrd and secondary fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies, and the DNA stain propidium iodide, cellular BrdUrd and DNA contents were quantified. To determine if there was a perturbation in the progression of cells through the S phase, the distribution of BrdUrd-labelled {{cells in the}} S phase was evaluated in two ways: (a) by calculating the mean DNA content of BrdUrd-labelled cells in relation to the mean DNA contents of G(1) and G(2) cells (relative movement(zero)) and (b) by studying DNA histograms of BrdUrd-labelled cells. By using both evaluation methods, we show <b>that</b> DNA replication <b>was</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> the first cell cycle <b>that</b> <b>was</b> initiated after seeding CHO cells in the presence of F(2) MeOrn. The cells appeared to enter the S phase normally but were then delayed in their progression through this phase. The impairment of F(2) MeOrn treatment on DNA replication was apparent at 9 h after seeding, a time point at which the putrescine pool was depleted, the spermidine pool was approximately halved, and the spermine pool was unaffected, when compared to corresponding pools of control cells. When cells were seeded in the presence of F(2) MeOrn and putrescine, the effect on DNA replication was prevented. The rates of incorporation of [H- 3]uridine and [H- 3]leucine into RNA and protein, respectively, were the same in control and in F(2) MeOrn-treated cells for at least up to 11 h after seeding...|$|R
40|$|Issues:&# 8194;Although {{increased}} research attention, {{the etiology}} of the hangover remains merely unknown, as are its consequences for daytime functioning. Approach:&# 8194;A literature search was conducted to update {{the current state of}} knowledge on the pathology of alcohol hangover and its consequences for daytime functioning. Key Findings:&# 8194;Much remains unknown about the pathology of alcohol hangover, but a significant role of the immune system seems evident. An overview is given of performance impairment on daily activities such a driving a car. In a recent study, a 100 -km simulated highway driving test was performed by 42 healthy volunteers, the morning following an evening of alcohol consumption and on a control day (no alcohol). Standard deviation of lateral position (i. e. the weaving of the car) was determined. Results showed <b>that</b> driving <b>is</b> significantly <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> alcohol hangover. However, the moderating role of total sleep time is discussed as well as other factors that may impact hangover severity. Finally, potential biomarkers of alcohol hangover and their relationship to performance impairment are discussed. Implications:&# 8194;Alcohol hangover results in reduced productivity and impaired daytime functioning. Future studies should aim to further examine its pathology in order to develop effective hangover cures, develop easy to use biomarkers of the hangover state (e. g. ethyl glucuronidein saliva), and adequate prevention strategies should be developed to reduces excessive alcohol consumption. Conclusion:&# 8194;The consequences of alcohol hangover are often underestimated but have significant socioeconomic and health consequences. Implications for Practice or Policy:&# 8194;The general public should be informed about the negative consequences of alcohol hangover on daytime functioning...|$|R
40|$|Mental {{retardation}} in Down syndrome (DS) {{has been}} imputed to the decreased brain volume, which is evident {{starting from the}} early phases of development. Recent studies in a widely used mouse model of DS, the Ts 65 Dn mouse, have shown <b>that</b> neurogenesis <b>is</b> severely <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> the early phases of brain development, suggesting that this defect may be {{a major determinant of}} brain hypotrophy and mental retardation in individuals with DS. Recently, it has <b>been</b> found <b>that</b> in the cerebellum of Ts 65 Dn mice there is a defective responsiveness to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), a potent mitogen that controls cell division during brain development, suggesting that failure of Shh signaling may underlie the reduced proliferation potency in DS. Based on these premises, we sought to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying derangement of the Shh pathway in neural precursor cells (NPCs) from Ts 65 Dn mice. We found that the expression levels of the Shh receptor Patched 1 (Ptch 1) were increased compared to controls both at the RNA and protein level. Partial silencing of Ptch 1 expression in trisomic NPCs restored cell proliferation, indicating <b>that</b> proliferation impairment <b>was</b> due to Ptch 1 overexpression. We further found that the overexpression of Ptch 1 in trisomic NPCs is related to increased levels of AICD, a transcription-promoting fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Increased AICD binding to the Ptch 1 promoter favored its acetylated status, thus enhancing Ptch 1 expression. Taken together, these data provide novel evidence that Ptch 1 over expression underlies derangement of the Shh pathway in trisomic NPCs, with consequent proliferation impairment. The demonstration that Ptch 1 over expression in trisomic NPCs is due to an APP fragment provides a link between this trisomic gene and the defective neuronal production that characterizes the DS brain. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypothesis}} <b>that</b> women <b>were</b> significantly <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> their menstrual cycle, she tested twenty-three females and two males (as controls) by giving them tasks, which involved perceptual and motor skills and mental abilities over a three-month period. She concluded that her data did, [...] "not reveal a periodic mental or motor inefficiency in normal women." [...] Hollingworth was also interested in challenging the widely accepted belief <b>that</b> intelligence <b>is</b> widely inherited and <b>that</b> women <b>were</b> intellectually inferior to men. She believed that women do not reach positions of prominence due to the social roles <b>that</b> <b>are</b> assigned to them, not because they are intellectually inferior to men. [...] An assertion held at the time <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> greater variability among men while women were less variable. Hollingworth referred to this variability hypothesis as [...] "armchair dogma" [...] which she characterized as the [...] "literature of opinion". This differs, she maintained, from the [...] "literature of fact" [...] which has been carefully obtained through controlled scientific data because it is merely statements made by scientific men not based on experimental evidence. Hollingworth states in her article, [...] "Variability as Related to Sex Differences in Achievement: A Critique", [...] "Undoubtedly {{one of the most difficult}} and fundamental problems that today confront thinking women is how to secure for themselves the chance to vary from the mode of their sex, and at the same time to procreate, in a social order <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> built up on the assumption <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> little or no variations in tastes, interests, and abilities within the female sex. It <b>is</b> a problem <b>that</b> has never confronted me." [...] In order to further her research on the [...] "inherently more variable male hypothesis", Dr. Hollingworth performed another experiment in which she used infants because they have not yet been influenced by the environmental conditions that could account for variability differences in adults. These environmental conditions would provide the adult male with many more opportunities to be more variable than females. Men had a wide range of professions from which to choose that would improve the talents they possessed. Women, on the other hand, had been confined to only one profession, housekeeping, which did not provide them the chance to prove their intelligence. Thus, their natural variability would <b>be</b> <b>impaired.</b> Dr. Hollingworth and Helen Montague collected data on 1,000 consecutively born males and 1,000 consecutively born females in the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. They took ten anatomical measurements on each infant and found that on the whole the male infants were slightly larger than the females, but there were no differences in variability between the sexes. [...] "For the first time a serious crack had appeared in the armor of the variability hypothesis". Hollingworth believed <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> mostly responsible for Thorndike's revised beliefs on the importance of nurture over nature. She also was responsible for Terman modifying his nativistic position concerning gender differences in intelligence testing. This was because Hollingworth showed <b>that</b> more men <b>were</b> classified as gifted due to social factors.|$|R
