5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E
5|$|To {{accomplish}} this goal, Harle helps Lynx manipulate the Acacia Dragoons, the powerful militia governing {{the islands of}} El Nido. As the Dragoons maintain order, <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> with Fargo, a former Dragoon turned pirate captain who holds a grudge against their leader, General Viper. Though tussling with Serge initially, the Acacia Dragoons—whose ranks include the fierce warriors Karsh, Zoah, Marcy, and Glenn—later assist him when the militaristic nation of Porre invades the archipelago. The invasion brings Norris and Grobyc to the islands, a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier, respectively, as they too seek the Frozen Flame.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{behavioral}} economics typically stress the rationality of economic agents. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that experimentally observed behavior has limited application to market situations, as learning opportunities and competition ensure {{at least a}} close approximation of rational behavior.|$|E

25|$|Most historians {{question}} whether the 13th-century ancestor, referred to in various places as a 'Moor' and Berber, was black African. In any event, <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> that the connection, nine and 15 generations removed, was too distant to consider Charlotte 'black' in any cultural way, as her other ancestors were all European.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} {{school of}} thought contends {{that in the case}} of inguinal hernia, the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch.|$|E
25|$|Critics of long {{residency}} hours {{trace the}} problem {{to the fact that}} a resident has no alternatives to positions that are offered, meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision. This process, <b>they</b> <b>contend,</b> reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.|$|E
50|$|Shah Sultan Muhammad's family {{boasted of}} their descent from Alexander the Great. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> that <b>they</b> had swayed the scepter of Badakhshan from three {{thousand}} years.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>contended</b> {{with the}} {{clerical}} group, the Alfaya, {{who supported the}} successors of the jihad leader Karamoko Alfa. The rivalry {{between the two groups}} continued into the 20th century in Guinea.|$|R
25|$|Zhao, Cheng, and Xu {{described}} the new {{genus and species}} Chaoyangsaurus youngi. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> {{that the presence of}} such an early, primitive ceratopsian in Asia suggested that this continent was where the ceratopsians first originated.|$|R
25|$|A {{minority}} of historians dispute that {{substantial numbers of}} mixed-blood Aboriginal children were forcibly taken from their families. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that some children were removed mainly {{to protect them from}} neglect and abuse. Official government estimates are that between one in ten and one in three indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970, affecting all regions of the country.|$|E
25|$|The CNE {{law passed}} quietly in August 2005, with less {{opposition}} than that {{sparked by the}} CPE since it applies to non-unionized businesses. However, its repeal was a primary goal of demonstrations held on October 4, 2005. After the April 2006 cancellation of the First Employment Contract, unions have increased pressure to cancel this contract; <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> that it creates precarious work for employees, endangering job security.|$|E
25|$|Daron Acemoğlu and James A. Robinson {{similarly}} criticized Diamond's work {{in their}} book Why Nations Fail. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that the theory is outdated and can not effectively explain differences in economic growth after 1500 or the reasons why states that are geographically close can exhibit vast differences in wealth. They instead favored an institutional approach in which a societies success or failure {{is based on the}} underlying strength of its institutions.|$|E
50|$|The {{defendants}} {{responded by}} entering a special {{appearance in the}} Delaware court {{for the purpose of}} moving to quash service of process and to vacate the sequestration order, thus contesting Delaware's exercise of jurisdiction over them. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> that none of them had ever set foot in Delaware or conducted any activities in that state. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> that the ex parte sequestration procedure did not accord them due process of law as required by the Fourteenth Amendment, as construed by Supreme Court cases defining the requirements of personal jurisdiction, and that exercising quasi in rem jurisdiction over property in the forum state that was unrelated to the subject-matter of the litigation was constitutionally impermissible.|$|R
25|$|In the 19th century, {{the tribe}} {{resisted}} repeated state efforts {{to declare that}} it was no longer an Indian tribe because its members were multiracial in ancestry. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> that <b>they</b> absorbed other ethnicities into their tribe and continued to identify culturally as Narragansetts.|$|R
50|$|Former {{chairman}} and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than $150 million from the company.

25|$|In 2002 Adam LeBor and Louis Sell {{would write}} that Pavlović was really {{dismissed}} because he opposed Milošević's policies towards Kosovo-Serbs. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that, contrary to advice from Stambolić, Milošević had denounced Pavlović as being soft on Albanian radicals. LeBor and Sell assert that Milošević prepared {{the ground for}} his ascent to power by quietly replacing Stambolić's supporters with his own people, thereby forcing Pavlović and Stambolić from power.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, anti-globalization proponents {{argue that}} those in the West who defend sweatshops show double {{standards}} by complaining about sweatshop labor conditions in countries considered enemies or hostile by Western governments, while still gladly consuming their exports but complaining about the quality. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that multinational jobs {{should be expected to}} operate according to international labor and environmental laws and minimum wage standards like businesses in the West do.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} Thomas is dependent on Syriac writings, including unique versions of the canonical gospels. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that many sayings of the Gospel of Thomas are more similar to Syriac translations of the canonical gospels than their record in the original Greek. Craig A. Evans states that saying 54 in Thomas, which speaks {{of the poor and}} the kingdom of heaven, is more similar to the Syriac version of Matthew 5:3 than the Greek version of that passage or the parallel in Luke 6:20.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, {{the tribe}} {{resisted}} repeated state efforts {{to declare that}} it was no longer an Indian tribe because its members were multiracial in ancestry. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> that <b>they</b> absorbed other ethnicities into their tribe and continued to identify culturally as Narragansetts.|$|R
50|$|Part of this {{reaction}} was a suspicion {{of the wisdom}} of their ecclesiastical rulers, who, they became convinced, had adopted in the past a needlessly strict attitude, opposed to English national aspirations and which (<b>they</b> <b>contended)</b> had been dictated by the Court of Rome.|$|R
5000|$|Former {{chairman}} and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than US$150 million from the company.

25|$|While {{an exact}} number {{has not been}} determined, {{thousands}} of Canadians have purchased and used what <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> to be grey market radio and television services, licensed in the United States but not in Canada. Users of these unlicensed services contend {{that they are not}} directly breaking any laws by simply using the equipment. The equipment is usually purchased from an American supplier (although some merchants have attempted to set up shop in Canada) and the services are billed to an American postal address. The advent of online billing and the easy availability of credit card services has made it relatively easy for almost anyone to maintain an account in good standing, regardless of where they actually live.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{psychiatrist}} David Spiegel {{said that}} the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study was unjustified. He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining {{the results of a}} large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions. Rind et al. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study in the meta-analysis of childhood sexual abuse – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects of CSA. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that the way they handled Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.|$|E
25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} {{found that men}} receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor {{playing the role of}} an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E
50|$|During {{the course}} of the {{investigation}} into the ship’s sinking, representatives of MTL theorized that the ship ran aground during her maneuvering to help the Theodora, fatally damaging the hull. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> that it was this grounding that caused the Marine Electric to sink five hours later.|$|R
50|$|Generals Jacinto Ligot and Carlos Garcia, {{who were}} the AFP's comptrollers when the system was in place, were detained; however, the Office of the Ombudsman went into a plea {{bargaining}} agreement with Garcia, in the government withdrew their cases against him as <b>they</b> <b>contended</b> the evidence was weak.|$|R
50|$|Since 1973, the Dann sisters {{conducted}} civil protest by ranching {{and refusing}} to pay grazing fees to BLM to run their cattle outside their ranch on what they consider Shoshone land. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> the US had taken the land illegally and not abided {{by the terms of}} its treaty.|$|R
25|$|Some people reject all {{claims that}} Cornwall is, or ought to be, {{distinct}} from England. While recognising {{that there are}} local peculiarisms, {{they point out that}} Yorkshire, Kent, and Cheshire (for example) also have local customs and identities that do not seem to undermine their essential Englishness. The legal claims concerning the Duchy, they argue, are without merit except as relics of mediaeval feudalism, and <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> that Stannary law applied not to Cornwall as a 'nation', but merely to the guild of tin miners. Rather, they argue that Cornwall has been not only in English possession, but part of England itself, either since Athelstan conquered it in 936, since the administrative centralisation of the Tudor dynasty, or since the creation of Cornwall County Council in 1888. Finally, they agree with representatives of the Duchy itself that the Duchy is, in essence, a real estate company that serves to raise income for the Prince of Wales. They compare the situation of the Duchy of Cornwall with that of the Duchy of Lancaster, which has similar rights in Lancashire, which is indisputably part of England. The proponents of such perspectives include not only Unionists, but most branches and agencies of government.|$|E
500|$|Smelser and Davies {{argue that}} the revisionist-inspired {{messages}} and visuals {{found their way into}} wargames, Internet chatrooms and forums and the popular culture of Waffen-SS [...] "romancers", that is those who romanticise the German war effort. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that the Achtung Panzer and Feldgrau websites are especially attractive to this group.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Ayesha Jalal, {{while there}} is a tendency towards hagiography in the Pakistani view of Jinnah, in India he is viewed negatively. [...] Ahmed deems Jinnah [...] "the most maligned person in recent Indian history... In India, many see him as the demon who divided the land." [...] Even many Indian Muslims see Jinnah negatively, blaming him for their woes as a minority in that state. Some historians such as Jalal and H. M. Seervai assert that Jinnah never wanted the partition of India—it was the outcome of the Congress leaders being unwilling to share power with the Muslim League. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> that Jinnah only used the Pakistan demand in an attempt to mobilise support to obtain significant political rights for Muslims.|$|E
50|$|The {{respondents}} did {{not seek}} to rely on their foundational allegation on appeal; <b>they</b> <b>contended</b> instead that the matter could be decided on the appellants' affidavits. They based their arguments {{on the premise that}} it appeared from those affidavits that the hearing did not comply with the audi rule.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic gave a {{positive}} retrospective {{review of the}} album. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> that Beans and Fatback lacks the deep emotional resonance of Link Wray, but [...] "goes a lot father toward fusing the rowdy howl of Wray's early instrumental hits with the back-to-the-land flavor of his more personal 1971 set." ...|$|R
2500|$|Five men {{known as}} the [...] "Spanish Negroes" [...] were among those arrested. Dark-skinned Spanish sailors who had been sold into slavery by a privateer, <b>they</b> <b>contended</b> <b>they</b> were full Spanish {{citizens}} and unfairly enslaved. Because Britain was at war with Spain, this did not earn them much sympathy; it even raised suspicions against them as infiltrators. The British colonists were worried about anyone with Spanish and Catholic ties. The five Spanish blacks were convicted and hanged.|$|R
