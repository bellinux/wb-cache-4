Two officers who had responded to a robbery in progress at the Borough Park Tobacco Company in Brooklyn, where Seedman worked at the time, were killed. That was the first time <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> a pair of NYPD officers in 30 years. When one of the suspects, Tony Dellernia, who had surrendered in Chicago and was extradited to New York, Seedman, as was customary, had him perp-walked in front of reporters outside the precinct house.|$|E

Beer was against the law. You could only drink shit like pints of peach schnapps". It consists of a two-note piano figure and a banjo part, over which Smith played a tape recording he had made of the wind howling outside his bedroom window. According to guitarist Marc Riley, [...] "He [...] just said he needed a tune, something Dylanish, and we knocked around on the piano {{in the studio and}} came up with that. But we hadn't heard the words until he suddenly did them." [...] The line [...] "Fall down flat in the Cafe Iol without a glance from the clientele" [...] describes an incident <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Smith that morning. He had tripped in a nearby cafe and fallen across several tables. He was surprised by the lack of response from the other customers, who seemed to have dismissed him as just another drunk.|$|E
500|$|Graham found {{writing for}} two Doctors easy, as Smith's Doctor had a {{constant}} [...] "internal dialogue" [...] {{and was always}} finishing his own sentences. He wanted each character to be different {{and did not want}} all of them to become evil, and the Doctor would help them discover their humanity. Graham wanted Jennifer to be the antagonist as he liked the idea of the quietest character becoming the most evil. The original script explained that she has a perfect memory, and so her Ganger was able to remember every terrible thing <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the Flesh. Several other sequences were cut from the final version of [...] "The Almost People". In the original script, the Doctor quizzes the Flesh Doctor about the events of The Mind of Evil (1971) and mentions former companions Jo Grant, Sarah Jane Smith, Romana, Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, and Donna Noble. There was also a montage of happy memories of the Doctor's life stored in the Flesh Doctor, which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of the show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen. Also cut was the TARDIS providing the Doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he had given it to the Flesh Doctor, in a similar fashion to [...] "The Eleventh Hour".|$|E

500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
