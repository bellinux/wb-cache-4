5|$|The Best Man Wins is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features Thanhouser's leading players Anna Rosemond, Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline in a drama about morality. Two suitors are vying for the hand of Julia Seaton and propose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same day, but she asks for a month to decide between them. In the time the caliber of both men are tested when asked by a young girl, named May, to help her dying mother. The doctor refuses to help and the lawyer offers his assistance, but her mother soon dies. The orphan is taken in by the Seaton family and personally attests {{to the character of}} both men when Julia Seaton has to choose between her suitors. The writer, director and cameraman are unknown. Released on May 14, 1910, the film was met with mostly positive reviews by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{allure of}} class respectability is another {{constant}} in Les Chouans, {{as it is}} for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an illegitimate child contributes to her position {{at the start of the}} novel. The ups and downs of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E

25|$|At {{some time}} in 1589 Crane married her second husband, George Carleton, {{and it was as}} Elizabeth Carleton that she was {{examined}} on 1 October 1589 by the ecclesiastical commissioners.

Together with Sir Richard Knightley, John Hales, and Roger Wigston and his wife, she was imprisoned in the Fleet. The interrogations of Knightley, Hales and the Wigstons likewise failed to elicit the identity of Martin Marprelate, which appears to have been unknown to those who harboured the secret press.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin V's rule, with Raymond of Tripoli as regent and his great-uncle Joscelin of Edessa as his guardian, was short. He was {{a sickly}} child {{and died in}} the summer of 1186. Raymond and his {{supporters}} went to Nablus, presumably in an attempt to prevent Sibylla from claiming the throne, but Sibylla and her supporters went to Jerusalem, where it was decided that the kingdom should pass <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that her marriage to Guy be annulled. She agreed but only if she could choose her own husband and king, and after being crowned, she immediately crowned Guy with her own hands. Raymond had refused to attend the coronation, and in Nablus he suggested that Isabella and Humphrey should be crowned instead, but Humphrey refused to agree to this plan which would have certainly started a civil war. Humphrey went to Jerusalem and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla, as did most of Raymond's other supporters. Raymond himself refused to do so and left for Tripoli; Baldwin of Ibelin also refused, gave up his fiefs, and left for Antioch.|$|E
25|$|Light has an {{associated}} frequency, and this frequency {{may be used}} to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tower. Light going up the tower is a just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive {{at the top of the}} tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock. For a 1km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.|$|E

Writing in her autobiography Barrett described becoming an editor as [...] "an appalling task as I knew nothing whatever of journalism". By taking on the job she also took on the risks connected with the increasingly militant WSPU.
