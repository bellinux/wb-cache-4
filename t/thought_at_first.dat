5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> that he, too, had lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} Reed's return from Baku, {{he began to}} {{experience}} dizziness and headaches, <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed typhus and {{sent him to the}} hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, {{at the head of the}} funeral procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the United States and deported to Russia in late 1919.|$|E
5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, and his face was smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E

5|$|Poly(A)polymerase {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1960 as an enzymatic activity in extracts made from cell nuclei that could polymerise ATP, but not ADP, into polyadenine. Although identified in {{many types of}} cells, this activity had no known function until 1971, when poly(A) sequences were found in mRNAs. The only function of these sequences was <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> to be protection of the 3' end of the RNA from nucleases, but later the specific roles of polyadenylation in nuclear export and translation were identified. The polymerases responsible for polyadenylation were first purified and characterized in the 1960s and 1970s, but {{the large number of}} accessory proteins that control this process were discovered only in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> to be {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate, retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E

25|$|Ervin gained lasting fame {{through his}} {{stewardship}} of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices, {{also known as the}} Senate Watergate Committee, from the 1972 presidential election. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield chose Ervin because it was unlikely Ervin was going to run for re-election in 1974 (and in fact did not), because he had no aspirations beyond his office, because of his knowledge of the law and the Constitution, and because he was an even-keeled, conservative, independent-minded Democrat.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{character}} of Hamlet in Shakespeare's same-titled work {{in the light of}} certain aspects of stoicism and medieval Christian philosophy. Throughout the course of the play we see Hamlet struggling with his <b>thoughts.</b> <b>At</b> <b>first</b> he deliberates without taking action as a consequence of his reasoning, but in the later stages of the play he gives in to passion, which ultimately leads to his own demise. The thesis gives an account of certain aspects of both philosophies that are displayed in the play and shows how those ideas influence {{the character of}} Hamlet and contextualize his personal tragedy. Hamlet fails to follow the philosophies that he praises and to grow as a character by overcoming his passions {{over the course of the}} play...|$|R
25|$|On 20 June 1970, {{two days}} after the Conservative Party's {{unexpected}} election victory, Macleod was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by the new Prime Minister, Heath. Despite being in pain, he made his one and only major speech on the economy as chancellor on 7 July 1970. In the speech Macleod bemoaned the high level of inflation and, at the same time, the highest level of unemployment since 1940. Later that day he was rushed to hospital with what was <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> to be appendicitis, but was in fact a Pelvic Diverticulum. He was discharged 11 days later; yet at 10.30pm on 20 July, while in 11 Downing Street, he suffered a massive heart attack and died at 11.35pm.|$|E
25|$|Damages, such as cracks on solar modules, {{have been}} seen on several occasions, mostly on the Sun installation, where 12 solar modules have been damaged, {{as well as on}} Jupiter and Saturn installations. It was <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> that the cause of the cracks was hitting modules several times with an {{extremely}} heavy metal object because they can take a capacity of 400 kg, and are extremely difficult to break. It was later discovered by chance from the nearby ferry security camera footage that the cracks were caused by 3500 kg pickup truck that ran over modules. After this damage City introduced 24 hours supervisor and surveillance cameras that monitor the Monument. In June 2009, a unidentified hard object smashed 4 modules, and on night of August 8, 2 more. Nevertheless, all broken modules have been replaced with new ones.|$|E

This {{did not mean that}} they were cleared for radar work. When Oliphant made the services of his secretary available for typing up the Peierl's and Frisch's papers for the Maud Committee in September 1940, they were not allowed to enter the Nuffield Building where she worked, so Peierls submitted them for typing by dictaphone on wax cylinders. Frisch and Peierls <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> that uranium enrichment was best achieved though thermal diffusion, but as the difficulties with this approach became more apparent they switched to gaseous diffusion, bringing in a fellow refugee from Germany, Franz Simon, as an expert on the subject. Peierls also recruited yet another refugee from Germany, Klaus Fuchs, as his assistant in May 1941.|$|E

When he did not answer their call, they ran to him and found him dead. According to Father Francis P. Duffy: “A bullet had pierced his brain. His body was carried in and buried by the side of Ames. God rest his dear and gallant soul.” A sniper's bullet likely killed him immediately. [...] According to military records, Kilmer died on the battlefield near Muercy Farm, beside the Ourcq River near the village of Seringes-et-Nesles, in France, on July 30, 1918 at the age of 31. For his valor, Kilmer was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre (War Cross) by the French Republic.|$|E
