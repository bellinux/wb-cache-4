40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} an {{inspection}} game of Customs and a smuggler. Customs has two options: patrol or no-patrol. <b>The</b> <b>smuggler</b> {{makes a decision}} {{on the amount of}} contraband to smuggle. In a given period of days, Customs has a limited number of opportunities to patrol while <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> can ship any amount of contraband as long as he has not exhausted this supply. When both players take action, there are some possibilities that Customs captures <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> and there are also possibilities that <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> is successful. If <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> is captured or there remains no day for playing the game, the game ends. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a multi-stage two-person zero-sum stochastic game, derive a closed form of equilibrium in a specific case and investigate the properties of the optimal strategies for the players. Nearly all past research has studied <b>the</b> <b>smuggler’s</b> strategy with <b>the</b> two choices of smuggling or no-smuggling. This paper focuses on <b>the</b> <b>smuggler’s</b> decision as to the amount of contraband...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} an {{inspection}} {{game of the}} customs and a <b>smuggler.</b> <b>The</b> customs can take two options of assigning a patrol or not. <b>The</b> <b>smuggler</b> has two strategies of shipping its cargo of contraband or not. Two players have several opportunities to take an action during {{a limited number of}} days but only <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> cannot discard any opportunity intentionally. When the smuggling coincides with the patrol, there are three possibilities that the customs captures <b>the</b> <b>smuggler,</b> <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> makes a success of the smuggling or none of them happens. If <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> is captured or there remains no day for playing the game, the game ends. There have been some studies so far on the inspection game. Some consider the cases that <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> has only one smuggling or the perfect-capture case that the customs can certainly arrest <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> on patrol, and others think of a recursive game without the probabilities of fulfilling players’ purposes. However there has been little study in which they discussed the stochastic inspection. In this paper, we formulate the problem into a multi-stage two-person zero-sum stochastic game and investigate some characteristics of its equilibrium solution, some of which are given in closed forms in special cases...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} two stochastic network interdiction {{models for}} thwarting nuclear smuggling. In the first model, <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> travels through a transportation network {{on a path}} that maximizes the probability of evading detection, and the interdictor installs radiation sensors to minimize that evasion probability. The problem is stochastic because <b>the</b> <b>smuggler’s</b> origin-destination pair is known only through a probability distribution {{at the time when}} the sensors are installed. In this model, <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> knows <b>the</b> locations of all sensors and the interdictor and <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> “agree ” on key network parameters, namely <b>the</b> probabilities <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> will be detected while traversing the arcs of the transportation network. Our second model differs in that <b>the</b> interdictor and <b>smuggler</b> can have differing perceptions of these network parameters. This model captures the case in which <b>the</b> <b>smuggler</b> is aware of only a subset of the sensor locations. For both models, we develop the important special case in which the sensors can only be installed at border crossings of a single country so that the resulting model is defined on a bipartite network. In this special case, a class of valid inequalities reduces the computation time for the identical-perceptions model...|$|R

Shortly thereafter, however, he was engaged to write <b>The</b> <b>Smugglers,</b> which he was told should take a higher priority. “The Nazis” was ultimately abandoned on June 15, 1966, with the sentiment being that the events it portrayed were {{too close to the}} present day.|$|E
5|$|Later discoveries {{turned up}} {{a large number of}} excised clips, held by {{interested}} parties as proof of the edits. In October 1996, Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board (now the Classification Board). These clips include <b>The</b> <b>Smugglers,</b> episodes 1, 3-4; The Highlanders, episode 1; The Underwater Menace, episodes 2, 4; The Macra Terror, episode 3; Fury From The Deep, episodes 2, 4-5; and The Wheel In Space, episode 4.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, <b>the</b> <b>smugglers,</b> the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Johnstone (sometimes called Tom Johnson) (1772-1839) was an English sailor, {{smuggler}} and Admiralty saboteur. He was {{commonly known}} as Johnstone <b>the</b> <b>Smuggler</b> or <b>the</b> Hampshire <b>Smuggler.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, in return for <b>the</b> <b>smugglers</b> receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E

25|$|Because {{smuggling}} {{was still}} rampant, he ordered close inspection of all ships arriving in port.
