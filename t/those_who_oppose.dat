5|$|Despite being replaced, {{the former}} flag of Belarus {{is used by}} <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> current Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The former flag {{consisted}} of a white background with a red horizontal stripe in the middle.

5|$|Christof {{continues}} his quest into the late-20th century, where he allies with the Brujah Pink, the enslaved Toreador Lily, and the Nosferatu Samuel. Other characters include the 300-year-old human {{leader of the}} Society of Leopold, Leo Allatius—who has unnaturally extended his lifespan by consuming vampire blood— and the Setite leader Lucretia. During his journey, Christof comes into conflict with Vukodlak, a powerful Tzimisce vampire intent on usurping the clans' ancestors and taking their power for himself. Trapped in a mystical sleep by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> his plot, Vukodlak commands his followers to help resurrect him.|$|E

50|$|During 1970 inner-party and Politburo {{criticism}} of EES gradually increased. On 14th SED plenum on December 1970 Ulbricht’s economic policy was sharply criticized by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> ESS {{for political reasons}} and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> it for the disruptions it caused to the economy. His main opponents were Erich Honecker, Willi Stoph and Alfred Neumann.|$|R

50|$|In Seychelles {{after the}} events of 5 June 1977, the very {{important}} exodus of Seychelles families had begun, as <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> FA Rene were deported. Among the most important challenges was basic: find housing, food and other basic needs such as education or employment. Additionally, however, there was the constant fear {{of the situation in}} Seychelles and those involved making life very difficult for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> or had opposed FA Rene government.|$|R

25|$|Even <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> Crossan’s theory, like Deconick, find {{themselves}} confused {{when attempting to}} locate the possible source for Thomas. Even though she believes the Common Sayings Source theory is unlikely, she does admit that “Thomas emerged as an oral text,” which {{is not out of}} line from what Crossan has suggested.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{opposition}} arose to {{the idea}} of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the World Federalist Movement (WFM). <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary. In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> the posting of the {{ten commandments}} on public {{property}} argue that it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display {{of the ten}} commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge Roy Moore that prohibiting the public practice of religion {{is a violation of}} the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the bombings}} {{generally}} assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties {{on both sides}} in the planned invasion of Japan: Kyūshū was to be invaded in October 1945 and Honshū five months later. It was thought Japan would not surrender unless there was an overwhelming demonstration of destructive capability. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> the bombings argue it was militarily unnecessary, inherently immoral, a war crime, or a form of state terrorism. Critics believe a naval blockade and conventional bombings would have forced Japan to surrender unconditionally. Some critics believe Japan was more motivated to surrender by the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria and other Japanese-held areas.|$|E
25|$|The ACNA has {{attempted}} to incorporate {{the full spectrum of}} conservative Anglicanism within Canada and the United States. As a result, it accommodates Anglo-Catholic, charismatic, and evangelical theological orientations. It also includes <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> and those who support women's ordination. Women can serve as clergy members in some dioceses, while other dioceses maintain an exclusively male clergy. Women are ineligible to serve as bishops. The ACNA defines Christian marriage exclusively as a lifelong union {{between a man and a}} woman and consequently condemns homosexual relationships, as well as extra-marital relations, that are non-celibate as sinful. The church holds a pro-life position on abortion and euthanasia.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{small amount}} of middle ground between those who term the events a coup and those who call them a constitutionally-sound {{succession}} of power. On the one hand, several supporters of Zelaya's removal, including Acting Honduran President Roberto Micheletti and the top army lawyer, have admitted that sending Zelaya out of the country was illegal, although they argue it was justified by the need to prevent violence. Micheletti said forcing deposed President Manuel Zelaya to leave the country, instead of arresting him, was a mistake. On the other hand, a fraction of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> the events consider the arrest warrant against Zelaya to be legal, although they say he was denied a fair trial.|$|E
25|$|Thor faces a {{prolonged}} struggle against Thanos when {{he seeks to}} remake the universe. When Odin dies in battle against Surtur, Thor becomes ruler of Asgard. The thunder god extends his rule to Earth, with major repercussions. Thor and the Asgardians slay or imprison <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> them, including a young religious mutant called Davis; Zarrko the Tomorrow Man; Perrikus of the Dark Gods; the U.S. Government, and even his fellow Avengers. Thor marries Amora (the Enchantress), and has a son, Magni, who upon reaching adulthood doubts his father's judgment. Wracked with guilt, Thor is drawn into battle with his former ally Tarene and the Destroyer (occupied by former foe Desak), and reverses these events via time travel.|$|E
25|$|Historically, abortions {{have been}} done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other {{traditional}} methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder. Those who favor the legality of abortion often hold that a woman {{has a right to}} make decisions about her own body.|$|E

25|$|Repair {{work began}} immediately, {{but it became}} {{apparent}} that it could not be repaired in time for the next sitting. Thus, the session starting on 1 September was moved to the Brussels hemicycle. Parliament was expected to move back to Strasbourg for the session starting on 22 September but had to remain in Brussels for that session as well as safety inspections dragged on. The event was greeted with joy by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> the Parliament's presence in Strasbourg, and mocked by eurosceptics who wore hard hats to the first plenary in Brussels after the incident (if Parliament had been sitting at the time, the collapsing ceiling would have hit members of the eurosceptic parties).|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there have been}} a number of miscarriages of justice since 1965 where someone convicted of murder has later had their {{conviction}} quashed on appeal and been released from prison, strengthening the argument of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> the death penalty's reintroduction. These include the Birmingham Six (cleared in 1991 of planting an IRA bomb which killed 21 people in 1974), the Guildford Four (cleared in 1989 of murdering five people in another 1974 IRA bombing), Stephen Downing (a Derbyshire man who was freed in 2001 after serving 27 years for the murder of a woman in a churchyard) and Barry George (who was freed in 2007 when his conviction for the 1999 murder of TV presenter Jill Dando was quashed on appeal).|$|E
25|$|The poetic {{material}} {{found is}} found largely in chapters 1–25 {{and consists of}} oracles in which the prophet speaks as God's messenger. These passages, dealing with Israel's unfaithfulness to God, the call to repentance, and attacks on the religious and political establishment, are mostly undated and have no clear context, but it is widely accepted that they represent the teachings of Jeremiah and are the earliest stage of the book. Allied to them, and also probably {{a reflection of the}} authentic Jeremiah, are further poetic passages of a more personal nature, which have been called Jeremiah's confessions or spiritual diary. In these poems the prophet agonises over the apparent failure of his mission, is consumed by bitterness at <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> or ignore him, and accuses God of betraying him.|$|E

50|$|The Act {{incorporates}} {{several key}} {{changes to the}} financial arrangements of higher education students, including many additional terms that were added to convince <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> earlier drafts.

25|$|The {{claims that}} there is no {{consensus}} is without merit. About 10 years ago, when opposition formed the central government, they had proposed retail reforms and suggested India consider FDI in retail. Retail reforms discussions are not new. More recently, retail reforms announced evolved after a process of intense consultations and consensus building initiative. In 2010, the Indian government circulated a discussion paper on FDI retail reforms. On 6 July 2011, another version of the discussion paper was circulated by the central government of India. Comments from a wide cross-section of Indian society including farmers' associations, industry bodies, consumer forums, academics, traders' associations, investors, economists were analysed in depth before the matter was discussed by the Committee of Secretaries. By early August 2011, the consensus from various segments of Indian society was overwhelming in favour of retail reforms. The reform outline was presented in India's Rajya Sabha in August 2011. The announced reforms are the result of this consensus process. The current opposition is not helping the consensus process, since consensus is not built by threats and disruption. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> current retail reforms should help build consensus with ideas and proposals. The opposition parties currently disrupting the Indian parliament on retail reforms have not offered even one idea or a single proposal on how India can eliminate food spoilage, reduce inflation, improve food security, feed the poor, improve the incomes of small farmers.|$|E
500|$|Some Belarusian emigrants use [...] "Vajacki marš" [...] and [...] "" [...] {{as their}} anthem.
