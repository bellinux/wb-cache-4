5|$|Most of Kassandra's {{family has}} come to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as mad, and become angry when she feels {{compelled}} to vocalize prophecies that foretell the end of Troy. Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city experiences an earthquake sent by Poseidon, killing the three young sons of Helen and Paris. After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector {{and his younger brother}} Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy. Akhilles kills Penthesilea in battle, and soon after Kassandra fires a fatally poisoned arrow at his unprotected heel.|$|E
5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E

25|$|From {{the time}} Helen was young, the Foster family moved quite {{frequent}}ly. After Helen's birth in Cedar City, the Fosters moved to Chicago so John could attend law school. Several years later, the family once again moved to Idaho. The frequent moves helped to shape Helen's outgoing personality {{as she was}} constantly concerned about what her new peers would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Being the oldest child and only daughter of the family, she took {{on a lot of}} responsibility as the family expanded. She often worked alongside her mother to care for her three younger brothers and complete chores, especially when financial circumstances were difficult for the Fosters.|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Afraid" [...] (featuring rapper Attitude), is a {{description}} of Furtado's fear of what people <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and she has said the chorus reminds her of [...] "walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in. Now that I'm an adult, I care about the inside of me ... Before I said I didn't care about what people thought about me, but I really did." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly {{published}} {{a summary of}} Voigt's research, Anderson released an open letter dated to August 21, 1991, refuting many of Kelly's claims and referring to it as [...] "the stupid drivel {{of those who have}} only a shallow grasp of their alleged research." [...] He stated that contrary to Kelly's assertions, the Harpy Coven had worshiped a goddess, who was known as Lilith, and that [...] "we did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as merely the Goddess, but as God Herself".|$|E

50|$|Eyre draws {{inspiration}} {{from what is}} unseen, and images from her dreams. She describes her work as involving the accumulation of impossible memories in an increasingly deliberate and meticulous documenting of an unreality.  While discarding her everyday life, she instead documents an invisible one and constructs an autobiography that depends less on truth than possibility. In exploring these issues of self-identity, Eyre takes a wholly intuitive approach to art-making and <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> photographs as automatisms. She <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> art as a healing process {{that can be used}} as we become increasingly alienated from our bodies and selves through advanced technology. She hopes that through her personal art she can become more connected. Janieta is more interested in exploring inner lives and <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> photographic practice as a sort of meditation.|$|R
500|$|During {{her time}} at Oxford, she was noted for her {{isolated}} and serious attitude. At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested me. She was good at general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made him <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E
500|$|Her father, Fraser C. Robinson III, {{died from}} {{complications}} from his illness in March 1991. She would later say {{that although he}} was the [...] "hole in my heart" [...] and [...] "loss in my scar", {{the memory of her}} father has motivated her each day since. Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well, Obama later telling Katie Couric that the loss made her <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm. This was seen as a turning point for Michelle.|$|E

[...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then I think maybe I should not have survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E

500|$|Wood spotted Susie Blake in {{a musical}} at the King's Head Theatre and cast her {{in the role of}} the opinionated {{continuity}} announcer. Wood said of her casting at the time, [...] "I didn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> particularly for the continuity announcer, but she came in and could do it, just like that. I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel so sorry for her always having to wear those terrible blouses". When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this is the last time we will all work together but I understand why Vic wanted to stop. Anyway there were only two series of Fawlty Towers and, as far as I'm concerned, this rates with it, so I'm sure it'll be shown lots of times".|$|E
500|$|Six months later, Rachel {{returns to}} Manchester, and moves into Karen and David's spare room. After Pete spots {{her at the}} supermarket, Adam prepares for what he thinks will be her {{homecoming}} with his child. Instead, Rachel reveals {{that she had the}} pregnancy terminated, unable to cope with not knowing whether the father was Adam or Kris. The abortion story was devised to avoid having all three couples in the series having children. Bullen and the executive producers Andy Harries and Christine Langan all agreed that having Rachel suffer a miscarriage would be a [...] "cop out" [...] but they split on whether she should terminate the pregnancy; Harries worried about the effect it would have on the character within the narrative, and what the audience would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> while Langan convinced him that it would be braver and more realistic for the character to go through with it.|$|E
500|$|Woodroof begins {{selling the}} {{drugs on the}} street and at gay nightclubs. He comes back into contact with Rayon, with whom he reluctantly sets up {{business}} since she can bring many more clients. The pair establish the [...] "Dallas Buyers Club", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. He gradually begins to respect Rayon and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a friend. When Woodroof has a heart attack caused by a recently acquired dose of interferon, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial, while Richard Barkley of the FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine buyers clubs (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and approve drugs is seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. Dr. Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.|$|E

500|$|In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas {{was married}} to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually {{shortened}} to [...] "Kasturba", and affectionately to [...] "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the {{custom of the region}} at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|Naruto's romantic {{partner was}} decided {{during the early}} stages of the manga. Since Hinata Hyuga always {{respected}} Naruto, even before the series' beginning, even before Iruka Umino, Kishimoto felt they were meant to be. This angered his wife who wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno. When Sakura was introduced, Kishimoto did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as Naruto's future wife, as he saw them as being just friends and teammates, although once Hinata had appeared, the author thought of forming a love triangle between the three characters. He later regretted the love triangle as he considered Naruto a fighting series with little focus on romance, and he reiterated that [...] "it was all about Naruto and Hinata getting married from an early stage". Later, when seeing the staff's work to focus a film on Naruto's relationship with Hinata, he decided to oversee the project. Nevertheless, he enjoyed seeing Naruto and Hinata's romantical scenes he did not write. In regards to Naruto's rank which remains as the lowest one, Genin, due to Naruto spending most of his Part II's time fighting and training, Kishimoto decided Naruto would skip the following ranks to become the Hokage, which he felt was appealing.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mixed reviews. [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{compared the}} song to [...] "Diva", stating that [...] "Video Phone" [...] is [...] "Almost equally weird, but much better, [...] introduces {{us to the}} unlikely figure of Beyoncé Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it.' She doesn't make for the world's most believable Reader's Wife, but it doesn't matter, because the spare, eerie backdrop of groans and echoing electronics is so thrilling." [...] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Knowles sings in a [...] "dirty groove on the slippery" [...] song. Colin Mcguire from PopMatters wrote that [...] "'Video Phone' is sexy enough {{to the point where}} it almost becomes uncomfortable to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> listening back to this with her father in the room." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the song ended the album abruptly. Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix noted that the song was [...] "smutty" [...] for an artist like Knowles. J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post chose the song as a highlight on I Am... Sasha Fierce saying, [...] "The moaning, groaning 'Video Phone' positions Beyoncé as the star of a sex tape set to a thrillingly spare soundtrack that sounds like a Nine Inch Nails instrumental." [...] A negative review for the song was given by Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald who described it as [...] "awful".|$|E

500|$|Teaching {{was one of}} the few careers {{then open}} to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £25 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she {{attended}} the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach—she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote—led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching. At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had [...] "brought me into the Socialist movement... It always makes me humble to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> indomitable courage". After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters, she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as [...] "brilliant and gifted".|$|E
500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E
