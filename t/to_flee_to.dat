5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus <b>to</b> <b>flee</b> <b>to</b> Gaul.

According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M.
