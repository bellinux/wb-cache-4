5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E

30|$|We {{check the}} {{validity}} of the marital satisfaction variable by examining whether the marital satisfaction in 2012 differed between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> remained married and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> divorced or separated between 2012 and 2014. Of the 3556 individuals <b>who</b> <b>were</b> married in 2012, 42 were divorced between 2012 and 2014 and 12 were separated during the same period. Although few people had changed marital status, the average degree of spousal satisfaction in 2012 for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> continued to <b>be</b> married was 4.459, 3.256 for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> divorced, and 3.000 for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> separated. Therefore, spousal satisfaction <b>was</b> lower for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> divorced or separated between 2012 and 2014, implying that the marital satisfaction variable is a reliable measure of happiness with the spouse.|$|R

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of using NVC {{as well as}} the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and Flack find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not and prefer to converse only among themselves.|$|E

5000|$|Johanan b. Zakkai {{illustrates}} {{the necessity of}} daily conversion and of constant readiness to appear before God in heaven by the following parable: [...] "A king invited his servants to a banquet without stating the exact time at which it would <b>be</b> given. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> wise remembered that all things are ever ready in the palace of a king, and they arrayed themselves and sat by the palace gate awaiting the call to enter, while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> foolish continued their customary occupations, saying, 'A banquet requires great preparation.' When the king suddenly called his servants to the banquet, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> wise appeared in clean raiment and well adorned, while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> foolish came in soiled and ordinary garments. The king took pleasure in seeing <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> wise, but was full of anger at <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> foolish, saying that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had come prepared for the banquet should sit down and eat and drink, but that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had not properly arrayed themselves should stand and look on" [...] (Shab. 153a). Similar parables expressing the same thought {{are found in the}} New Testament (Matt. xxii. 10-12, xxv. 1-12; Luke xii. 36), but the Talmudic fable shows the finer and more striking elaboration.|$|R

For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability.
