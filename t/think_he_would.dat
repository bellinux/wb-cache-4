5|$|Leonard Nimoy was not {{originally}} {{considered for}} the role as the celebrity at the maiden voyage of the monorail, as the writing staff did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> accept, because William Shatner had previously turned the show down. Instead, George Takei was asked to guest star as he had appeared on the show once before. After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying {{he did not want}} to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority). As a result, the staff went to Nimoy, who accepted.|$|E

[...] Jagger retorted: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably like to get the same honour himself. It's like being given an ice creamone gets one and they all want one." ...|$|E
500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{recovering}} in the hospital, Morenz {{received many}} get-well cards and visits from his teammates and players from other NHL teams. So {{many of them}} brought drinks that a teammate remarked that [...] "the whisky was on the dresser and the beer was under the bed." [...] Though there were many visitors, Morenz often found himself alone in the hospital room, unable to move off his bed. To pass the time, he read newspapers to stay up to date with the Canadiens as they finished the season. Since his injury, the team had dropped in the standings, causing Morenz to worry. He began to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never play hockey again and became depressed.|$|E

[...] "He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke. He was no gift. There weren't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up." [...] says Phil Coulter in the book.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{also ran}} an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member, {{and led the}} group on a diving trip to the Bahamas. In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979 (eight years after Reinboldt's high school {{graduation}} in 1971), her brother {{had told her that}} he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation.

500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip [...] "I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brian– give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been a good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{creators of}} Charlotte are Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, and Charlotte {{is the second}} original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! (2010). Hironori Toba of Aniplex approached Maeda in early 2012 with an offer from P.A.Works president Kenji Horikawa to do another anime series with the studio. Maeda was surprised by this, as he never expected to work with P.A.Works again. Horikawa explained that the production staff could now handle things that {{were not able to}} be fully materialized during the production of Angel Beats!. Maeda did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ever be involved in the planning of another anime series, but {{he said that he had}} no choice but to accept Horikawa's offer after discussing it with him. Toba asked Maeda to write a [...] "Key-like story", and Maeda started out by applying his prior experience of working on Angel Beats!. He went through a trial-and-error process to work out what kind of setting and story would work well for an anime series.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with London's Evening Standard in January 2013, Anthony Hopkins (who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock) questioned The Girls portrayal of the director {{and the need for}} a film about that period of Hitchcock's career: [...] "I talked to Tippi Hedren one day...and she never mentioned that...Whatever his obsession was, she didn't want to dwell on it...I don't think it's necessary to put all that into a movie." [...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal {{of a man who was}} a little more complex than that. A lot of people, who were there, do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E
