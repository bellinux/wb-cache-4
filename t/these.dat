5|$|A {{large number}} of stone monuments {{were placed in the}} North Acropolis. By the 9th century AD <b>these</b> {{included}} 43 stelae and 30 altars; 18 of <b>these</b> monuments were sculpted with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. A number of <b>these</b> monuments show the influence of the great city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of <b>these</b> {{differences}} are due to iotacisms and variants in transcribing Hebrew names. <b>These</b> two manuscripts were not written in the same scriptorium.|$|E
5|$|Above <b>these</b> ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. <b>These</b> were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in <b>these</b> rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, <b>these</b> chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with <b>these</b> functional groups. <b>These</b> include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of <b>these</b> functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E

5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. <b>These</b> redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, <b>these</b> redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, <b>these</b> proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. <b>These</b> linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. <b>These</b> bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, <b>these</b> lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, <b>these</b> bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, <b>these</b> spots are interpreted as collapse pits within <b>these</b> ridged plain belts.|$|E
5|$|However, all of <b>these</b> efforts faced {{considerable}} environmental opposition, {{which has}} been successful in blocking <b>these</b> plans, which were estimated to cost as much as $2billion.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} {{theoretical}} advantages, <b>these</b> algorithms {{are not an}} improvement for the typical ranges of <b>these</b> parameters that arise in practical sorting problems.|$|E
5|$|In {{chemical}} fields, such as crystallography, space {{groups and}} point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. <b>These</b> symmetries underlie {{the chemical and}} physical behavior of <b>these</b> systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of <b>these</b> properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur {{simply because of the}} symmetry of the states involved.|$|E
5|$|In <b>these</b> {{conditions}} the Ottoman forces encountered {{on the road}} were the rearguards von Falkenhayn had ordered XX Corps to establish as it retired back to defend Jerusalem. Established on commanding ridges, <b>these</b> rearguards were made up of small groups dug in on the hills. Each of <b>these</b> successive positions were attacked by Indian and Gurkha troops who outmanoeuvred the defenders.|$|E
5|$|Magnesium-poor adakites {{have been}} found at Monte Burney. Fueguino {{volcanic}} rocks also include adakites but <b>these</b> are richer in magnesium. <b>These</b> adakitic magmas reflect the subduction of a relatively hot and young Antarctic Plate. In the case of Monte Burney, <b>these</b> magmas then underwent some fractionation during ascent, as it was retarded by the tectonic regimen, which is somewhat compressive.|$|E
5|$|Minnesotans {{participate}} in {{high levels of}} physical activity, and many of <b>these</b> activities are outdoors. The strong interest of Minnesotans in environmentalism {{has been attributed to}} the popularity of <b>these</b> pursuits.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of <b>these</b> were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of <b>these</b> images shows no discernible differences at <b>these</b> sites. This does not necessarily imply that <b>these</b> reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that <b>these</b> were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test <b>these</b> theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of <b>these</b> models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize <b>these</b> approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on <b>these</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} proteasome was identified in human cells that lack the α3 core subunit. <b>These</b> proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. Interestingly, <b>these</b> alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of <b>these</b> proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing <b>these</b> proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} claim {{sovereignty in}} certain regions. While {{a few of}} <b>these</b> countries have mutually recognised each other's claims, the validity of <b>these</b> claims is not recognised universally.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: <b>these</b> are double-stranded DNA viruses {{with unusual}} and sometimes unique shapes. <b>These</b> viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against <b>these</b> viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. <b>These</b> enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls. <b>These</b> massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. <b>These</b> gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of <b>these</b> outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.|$|E
5|$|The Scout Law, Scout Oath(No {{longer for}} boys only or those that use {{religious}} based morals.), Scout Motto, Scout Slogan, and Outdoor Code are {{the cornerstones of}} Boy Scouting. Each Scout learns to make <b>these</b> ideals {{a part of their}} way of life and personal growth. Boy Scouts must memorize and understand <b>these</b> ideals. They also represent <b>these</b> ideals symbolically in official emblems.|$|E
5|$|The {{assembly}} of <b>these</b> extracellular structures {{is dependent on}} bacterial secretion systems. <b>These</b> transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion systems are known and <b>these</b> structures are often essential for the virulence of pathogens, so are intensively studied.|$|E
5|$|The {{report cards}} for <b>these</b> {{operations}} are highly controversial. Some sources claim the commandos suffered immense casualties and were ineffectual. However, {{it is clear}} that <b>these</b> operations inflicted damage and caused confusion and anxiety among the Israelis, who diverted resources to counter <b>these</b> threats, while reservists were slowed down. One Israeli divisional commander also commended the Egyptian Sa'iqa.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> codes make {{it easier}} and shorter to write down the amino acid {{sequences}} that make up proteins. The nucleotide bases {{are made up of}} purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine or uracil). <b>These</b> nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA. <b>These</b> nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> courses often preceded major {{publications}} in <b>these</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> points can {{be applied}} to the {{structure}} of The Waste Land, though there is not necessarily a fulfilment of <b>these</b> but merely a longing or discussion of them.|$|E
5|$|Until 2017, <b>these</b> {{species were}} {{considered}} part of the family Emberizidae. Most of the species are known as sparrows, but <b>these</b> birds are not closely related to the Old World sparrows which are in the family Passeridae. Many of <b>these</b> have distinctive head patterns.|$|E

5|$|Variations of {{the drink}} include lemon drops {{prepared}} with blueberries and raspberries, which may use vodkas or other liquors flavored with <b>these</b> respective berries. <b>These</b> drinks {{may also be}} served or garnished with <b>these</b> berries, or with lemon. A blueberry lemon drop may be prepared with muddled blueberries, and a raspberry lemon drop may be prepared with puréed or crushed raspberries.|$|E
5|$|When asked, many signers in the South gave anecdotal {{accounts}} {{of differences between}} the signing of Black and White signers. <b>These</b> differences {{turned out to be}} aspects of the differing phonology of BASL. Among <b>these</b> accounts were claims that Black signers had a larger signing space and used more two-handed signs. Investigation into <b>these</b> anecdotes has found correlations.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at <b>these</b> depths, water emerges from <b>these</b> vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at <b>these</b> depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Amounts of {{acetic acid}} used in <b>these</b> other {{applications}} together (apart from TPA) account for another 5–10% of acetic acid use worldwide. <b>These</b> applications are, however, {{not expected to}} grow as much as TPA production.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>these</b> grand state buildings, {{there are}} also several minor {{structures}} and pavilions surrounding the Phra Maha Monthien structures. <b>These</b> include four smaller halls {{at the sides of}} the Amarin Winitchai Throne hall.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with <b>these</b> zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. <b>These</b> continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in <b>these</b> zones. <b>These</b> artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. <b>These</b> data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused <b>these</b> hospitals to close. Many of <b>these</b> rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in rural areas. Some of <b>these</b> hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but {{only a small number}} operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.|$|E
5|$|Hindu mythology {{contains}} numerous incidents where sexual interactions serve a non-sexual, sacred purpose; in some cases, <b>these</b> are same-sex interactions. Sometimes {{the gods}} condemn <b>these</b> interactions but {{at other times}} they occur with their blessing.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{there were}} seven farms on the Aldermaston estate —Forsters Farm, Village Farm, Church Farm, Upper Church Farm, Raghill Farm, Park Farm, and Soke Farm. <b>These</b> {{accounted}} for approximately 75% of the estate's land. Aside from <b>these,</b> there were six smallholdings within the parish but outside the land owned by the court. <b>These</b> were Springhill Farm, Court Farm, Strawberry Farm, Circus Farm, Ravenswing Farm, and Frouds Farm.|$|E
