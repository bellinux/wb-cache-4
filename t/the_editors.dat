5|$|The {{final draft}} went smoothly, {{except for a}} clash with <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> of The Russian Messenger, about which very little is known.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Grant's {{casualties}} in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, {{but it was never}} issued. In response to rumors of one, however, <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E

5|$|Many subgenres {{of heavy}} metal {{developed}} {{outside of the}} commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash. Several {{attempts have been made}} to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.|$|E

5|$|The journal was {{a private}} venture, {{although}} no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> often had to support the publication {{out of their own}} pockets.

5|$|The {{succeeding}} year, {{the only}} time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement. Members of the senior class had decided {{to make fun of}} the professors in the Green Bag—City College's year book since 1896. When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> of the Green Bag and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony.

5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W.

Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Russian Provisional Government declared a general amnesty and offered to fund the return of those Russians who had been exiled as political opponents of the Empire; the entire staff of Golos Truda elected to leave New York City for Russia and to move the periodical to Petrograd. In Vancouver on May 26, 1917, <b>the</b> <b>editors,</b> along with Ferrer Center artist Manuel Komroff and thirteen others, boarded a ship bound for Japan. On board, the anarchists played music, gave lectures, staged plays and even published a revolutionary newspaper, The Float. From Japan, the band made their way to Siberia, and proceeded East to European Russia.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as <b>the</b> <b>editors</b> who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Bibliographers do {{not always}} agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of Amazing.
