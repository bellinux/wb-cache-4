Tom was named the official head of <b>the</b> <b>businesses,</b> Nick and Penny each named vice-chairman. Together, the three were to oversee the Pritzker family assets. Jay intended to keep the family business together, devising a system of trusts that would allow individual family members to receive money from the trusts to meet their needs; however, the family's wealth was to be primarily maintained in the trusts to grow <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> and fund philanthropic endeavors. The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15billion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Business</b> {{constraints}} restrict <b>the</b> enterprise structure, govern <b>the</b> <b>business</b> {{behavior and}} contribute to <b>the</b> <b>business</b> goals. Due to stuff turnover and lack of documentation the knowledge of what constraints exist and how they interact are often poorly defined.

A model-driven discovery approach is proposed to help the user to uncover <b>the</b> <b>business</b> constraints from <b>the</b> enterprise documents. This approach proposes a meta-model to describe the ontological constructs of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> constraints enforcing environment, defines a set of formal templates to document <b>the</b> <b>business</b> constraints to facilitate communication, sharing and reuse, gives a verification algorithm to ensure the completeness and validness of <b>the</b> discovered <b>business</b> constraints, defines <b>the</b> interactions among <b>business</b> constraints and finally proposes an elicitation procedure to efficiently guide <b>the</b> <b>business</b> users to discover <b>the</b> <b>business</b> constraints. Moreover, an example is presented to demonstrate the discovery approach of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> constraints and their usage for decision-making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} uncertainty and <b>the</b> <b>business</b> cycle on US high-tech manufacturing firms' research investment.

Using firm-level data on sales, cash flow, and industry-level indicators of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> cycle, this paper finds that the firm's response to <b>the</b> <b>business</b> depends on <b>the</b> firm's industry and the industry's current location in <b>the</b> <b>business</b> cycle. <b>The</b> data also shows that <b>the</b> <b>business</b> cycle also depresses the firm's reaction to changes in sales and cash flow.

Once on the north side of the canal, NY250 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester and West Shore Subdivisions at a single grade crossing ahead of High Street.

5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage.

5|$|A {{state of}} civil {{disorder}} {{existed in the}} island's mountainous region after {{the invasion of the}} United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under the influence of alcohol, and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the initial silver rush, a town site was platted {{and the town}} was built. The first permanent business building established in Silver Reef was a store {{at the intersection of}} the roads from the Buckeye, White, and East reefs. By 1878, the town's business district consisted of a hotel, boarding houses, nine stores, six saloons, five restaurants, a bank, two dance halls, a newspaper called The Silver Echo (which later became the Silver Reef Miner), and eight dry goods stores. Two cemeteries, one Catholic and one Protestant, were located south of Silver Reef's business district. Most of <b>the</b> <b>businesses</b> in Silver Reef were situated along a mile-long Main Street. The mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills: the Christy, Stormont, Leeds, Buckeye and Barbee & Walker mills. Although it was surrounded by settlements with large Mormon populations, the town never had a Mormon meeting house. A Catholic church was the only church located within the town. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, many of the Chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work. Some returned to China, but others remained in Utah. A group of 250 of these workers set up a Chinatown in a level area just south of Silver Reef. Silver Reef's Chinatown had a Chinese mayor and several businesses. By 1879, Silver Reef's population had reached 2,000, and the town also had a horse race track, a brewery, and a brass band. Shooting matches among members of the Silver Reef Rifle Club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place on the horse race track.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, Germany {{invaded the}} Netherlands, and the {{occupation}} government began to persecute Jews by {{the implementation of}} restrictive and discriminatory laws; mandatory registration and segregation soon followed. Otto Frank tried to arrange for the family to emigrate to the United States – the only destination that seemed to him to be viable – but this possibility was blocked from June 1941, as the U.S. government was concerned that people with close relatives still in Germany could be blackmailed into becoming Nazi spies. The Frank sisters were excelling in their studies and had many friends, but {{with the introduction of}} a decree that Jews could attend only Jewish schools, they were enrolled at the Jewish Lyceum. Anne became a friend of Jacqueline van Maarsen in the Lyceum. In April 1941, Otto took action to prevent Pectacon from being confiscated as a Jewish-owned business. He transferred his shares in Pectacon to Johannes Kleiman and resigned as director. The company was liquidated and all assets transferred to Gies and Company, headed by Jan Gies. In December, Otto followed a similar process to save Opekta. <b>The</b> <b>businesses</b> continued with little obvious change and their survival allowed Otto to earn a minimal income, but sufficient to provide for his family.|$|E
