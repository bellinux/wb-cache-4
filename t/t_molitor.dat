5000|$|The {{fact that}} the binding motif appears as a [...] "triplet" [...] of the conserved TxT repeat, {{as well as the}} {{observation}} that blastp queries have returned no viable matches, has led some researchers to suggest that RiAFP represents a new type of AFP - one that differs from the heavily studied TmAFP (from <b>T.</b> <b>molitor),</b> DcAFP (from D. canadensis), and CfAFP (from C. fumiferana). On the basis of these observations, it has been predicted that the need for insect AFPs came about after insect evolutionary divergence, much like the evolution of fish AFPs; thus, different AFPs most likely evolved in parallel from adaptations to cold (environmental) stress. As a result, homology modelling with TmAFP, DcAFP, or CfAFP would prove to be fruitless.|$|E

50|$|Tenebrionid beetles occupy {{ecological}} niches in mainly deserts {{and forests}} as plant scavengers. Most species are generalistic omnivores, and feed on decaying leaves, rotting wood, fresh plant matter, dead insects, and fungi as larvae and adults. Several genera, including Bolitotherus, are specialized fungivores which feed on polypores. Many {{of the larger}} species are flightless, {{and those that are}} capable, such as <b>T.</b> <b>molitor,</b> only do so when necessary, such as when dispersing or malnourished.The larvae, known as mealworms or false wireworms, are usually fossorial, heavily armored and nocturnal. They may possibly be an important resource for certain invertebrates and small mammals. However, the adults of many species have chemical defenses and are relatively protected against predators. Adults of most species, except grain pests, have slow metabolisms, and live long lives compared to other insects, ranging from approximately six months to two years.|$|E

Understanding the mechanisms evolved by the parasitoids to evade or suppress the host immune system is important for dissecting this interaction, while it was still poorly known. In order to gain insight into the immune response of Tenebrio molitor to parasitization by Scleroderma guani, the transcriptome of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae was sequenced with focus on immune-related gene, and the non-parasitized and parasitized <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae were analyzed by digital gene expression (DGE) analysis with special emphasis on parasitoid-induced immune-related genes using Illumina sequencing. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a single run, 264, 698 raw reads were obtained. De novo assembly generated 71, 514 unigenes with mean length of 424 bp. Of those unigenes, 37, 373 (52. 26 %) showed similarity to the known proteins in the NCBI nr database.

Oxygen consumption measurements on protein extracts showed activity on L-tyrosine, L- 3, 4 -di-hydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) and L-dopamine, indicating phenoloxidase as {{a key player in}} browning. Furthermore, no reaction on 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) was observed, ruling out an important contribution of laccase to browning. The browning reaction was most prominent at pH 6 for <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> and A. diaperinus, and 7 for H. illucens. As the enzyme activity of H. illucens was the lowest with the darkest color formation, this was likely caused by another factor.

40|$|A assincronia entre a dinâmica populacional de pragas e de seus inimigos naturais pode resultar em surtos populacionais de pragas. Isto se deve, dentre outros fatores, à ausência de predadores para a colonização das lavouras e, posteriormente, à falta de alimento para a sustentação desses insetos. O estabelecimento de inimigos naturais é, normalmente, mais lento e, atingem populações expressivas após os picos populacionais das pragas. A compreensão do papel das plantas na dinâmica populacional pode permitir a manipulação de predadores onívoros em sistemas agrícolas e melhorar a eficiência desses inimigos naturais. Supputius cincticeps (Stal) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) apresenta potencial para o controle biológico de pragas e, por isto, a morfologia das glândulas salivares, as características reprodutivas e os parâmetros das tabelas de fertilidade e esperança de vida desse predador foram estudadas com diferentes plantas e pupas de Tenebrio molitor (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) em laboratório. Os tratamentos foram: T 1 - folhas de eucalipto + pupas de <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, T 2 - folhas de soja + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, T 3 - folhas de feijão + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, T 4 - folhas de algodoeiro + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, T 5 - folhas de tomateiro + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água e T 6 - <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água (testemunha). Os casais de S. cincticeps receberam água, diariamente, e duas pupas de <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> três a quatro vezes por semana. Morfologicamente, o sistema salivar de S. cincticeps é constituído por um par de glândulas salivares principais e outro de glândulas acessórias, no protórax. As principais são bilobadas com lóbulo {{anterior}} esférico, menor que o posterior que apresenta forma de saco alongado e as acessórias, longas e tubulares originando-se na porção terminal do ducto acessório, que sofre um abaulamento. Quanto aos parâmetros reprodutivos, o número de ovos por fêmea de S. cincticeps foi menor sem planta que nos demais tratamentos e o de ninfas por fêmea, maior em folhas de eucalipto, soja, feijão ou algodoeiro que com tomateiro ou sem planta. As taxas líquidas de reprodução (Ro) de fêmeas de S. cincticeps foram maiores com folhas de eucalipto (68, 39), soja (57, 28) ou feijão (58, 69) e menor sem planta com 15, 06 fêmeas produzidas por fêmea. As taxas intrínsecas de crescimento (rm) foram maiores com folhas de eucalipto (0, 10) ou de soja (0, 10) e menor sem planta com 0, 07 fêmeas/fêmea de S. cincticeps acrescentadas à população por dia. A razão finita de aumento populacional (&# 955;) foi maior com folhas de soja (1, 11), eucalipto (1, 11) ou feijão (1, 10) e menor sem planta com 1, 07 fêmeas/fêmea de S. cincticeps acrescentadas à população por dia. Plantas de eucalipto, soja ou feijão melhoraram as características biológicas de S. cincticeps, o que é importante para esse predador no controle biológico de pragas nessas culturas. No entanto, o impacto negativo de plantas de tomateiro indica que o controle biológico de pragas nessa cultura com S. cincticeps pode ter baixa eficiência. The asynchrony between {{population dynamics}} of pests and their natural enemies {{may lead to}} population outbreaks of pests. This is due, among other factors {{to the absence of}} predators for the colonization of crops and, subsequently, the lack of food to sustain these natural enemies. The establishment of natural enemies is usually slower and reaches significant populations after peak of pests. Understanding the role of plants in population dynamics may allow for the manipulation of omnivorous predators in agricultural systems and improve the efficiency of natural enemies. Supputius cincticeps (Stal) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) has potential for biological pest controls. The objective of this research was to study the morphology of salivary glands, reproductive characteristics and parameters of fertility and life expectancy tables of the predator S. cincticeps with different plants and Tenebrio molitor (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) pupae in the laboratory. The treatments were: T 1 - eucalyptus leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 2 - soybean leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 3 - bean leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 4 - cotton leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 5 - tomato leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water and T 6 - <b>T</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water (control). The pairs of S. cincticeps received water daily, and two pupae of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> three to four times a week. The salivary system of S. cincticeps is formed by a pair of principal glands and another pair of accessory glands in the prothorax. The principal glands are bilobed with a spherical anterior lobe, which is smaller than the posterior lobe that presents a prolonged sack form. The accessory glands present a long and tubular form that arises from the terminal portion of the accessory duct that suffers a camber. The number of eggs per female of S. cincticeps was lowest without plants. The number of nymphs per female was higher in eucalyptus, soybean, bean and cotton leaves than in tomato leaves and without plants. The net reproductive rates (Ro) of females S. cincticeps were highest on eucalyptus (68. 39), soybean (57. 28) and bean (58. 69) leaves, and lowest without plants with 15. 06 females added per female of this predator. The intrinsic rates of increase (rm) were highest with eucalyptus (0. 10) and soybean (0. 10) leaves, and lowest without plants with 0. 07 females/female of S. cincticeps added to the population per day. The finite rate of increase (&# 955;) was highest with soybean (1. 11), eucalyptus (1. 11) and bean (1. 10) leaves, and lowest without plants with 1. 07 females/female of S. cincticeps added to the population per day. Eucalyptus, soybean and bean plants improved the biological characteristics of S. cincticeps which is important for this predator in the biological control of pests in these crops. However, the negative impact of tomato plants indicates that the biological control of pests in this culture with S. cincticeps may have low efficiency...|$|E
30|$|By {{looking at}} the total fruitbody yield of the six Formulae, {{it can be seen}} that the spent P. eryngii {{substrate}} supplemented with only 1 % sucrose and 1 % lime (Formula  1) could yield 404.17  g/kg fruitbody for 2 flushes, namely achieving a biological efficiency of 40.42 %, which was satisfactorily obtained from a farm waste (Jeznabadi et al. 2016). Supplementation of 10 – 20 % wheat bran (Formulae  2, 3) or 10 % feces (Formula  4) significantly increased total fruitbody yield, so that the biological efficiency was raised to over 51.56 %. Supplementation of 20 % (Formula  5) or 10 % feces plus 10 % wheat bran (Formula  6) resulted in the highest biological efficiency of over 61.10 % which was not only significantly higher than Formula  1 but also higher than the 10 – 20 % wheat bran supplementation formula and the 10 % feces supplementation formula. Therefore, <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> feces was superior to wheat bran to supplement the spent P. eryngii substrate for cultivation of A. chaxingu. It was shown previously that the nutritive value of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> was superior to livestock meat (Rumpold and Schlüter 2013) and insects including <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> are far more efficient in transforming plant biomass into animal biomass than conventional livestock (Nakagaki and DeFoliart 1991).|$|E
40|$|Critical thermal limits {{provide an}} {{indication}} of the range of temperatures across which organisms may survive, and the extent of the lability of these limits offers insights into the likely impacts of changing thermal environments on such survival. However, investigations of these limits may be affected by the circumstances under which trials are undertaken. Only a few studies have examined these effects, and typically not for beetles. This group has also not been considered {{in the context of the}} time courses of acclimation and its reversal, both of which are important for estimating the responses of species to transient temperature changes. Here we therefore examine the effects of rate of temperature change on critical thermal maxima (CT max) and minima (CT min), as well as the time course of the acclimation response and its reversal in two beetle species, Tenebrio molitor and Cyrtobagous salviniae. Increasing rates of temperature change had opposite effects on <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> and C. salviniae. In <b>T.</b> <b>molitor,</b> faster rates of change reduced both CT max (c. 2 °C) and CT min (c. 3 °C), while in C. salviniae faster rates of change increased both CT max (c. 6 °C) and CT min (c. 4 °C). CT max in <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> showed little response to acclimation, while the response to acclimation of CT min was most pronounced following exposure to 35 °C (from 25 °C) and was complete within 24 h. The time course of acclimation of CT max in C. salviniae was 2 days when exposed to 36 °C (from c. 26 °C), while that of CT min was less than 3 days when exposed to 18 °C. In <b>T.</b> <b>molitor,</b> the time course of reacclimation to 25 °C after treatments at 15 °C and 35 °C at 75 % RH was longer than the time course of acclimation, and varied from 3 - 6 days for CT max and 6 days for CT min. In C. salviniae, little change in CT max and CT min (< 0. 5 °C) took place in all treatments suggesting that reacclimation may only occur after the 7 day period used in this study. These results indicate that both <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> and C. salviniae may be restricted in their ability to respond to transient temperature changes at short-time scales, and instead may have to rely on behavioral adjustments to avoid deleterious effects at high temperatures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Insects are considered a valuable resource used by several populations across the world, due to palatability, beliefs, cultural traditions, but mainly because of its nutritional value. The main purpose of this study was to analyze larvaes of Tenebrio molitor and crickets Acheta domesticus as possible food source. Both species have been acquired directly from an insects’ productor and afterwards freeze-dried. The samples reflect high protein contents, 45 % for A. domesticus, 44 % for <b>T.</b> <b>molitor,</b> and a crude fat level of 18 % for both of them. Fatty acids have been quantified unveiling that percentages of 28, 9 % and 32, 9 % of the total amount of crude fat of A. domesticus and <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> represent essential fatty acids (linoleic and α-linolenic). Furthermore both species may be considered as mineral sources due to essential microelements content of iron and zinc (8. 65 and 9. 2 mg of iron / 100 g d. m. and 8. 15 and 6. 17 mg of zinc / 100 g d. m. for A. domesticus and <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> respectively) and also manganese content (2. 5 mg/ 100 g d. m., for A. domesticus...|$|E

Yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.) {{can be grown}} on diets composed of organic by-products. However, these diets could be contaminated with mycotoxins. Thus far, {{little is known about}} possible retention, sequestration, excretion or detoxification of mycotoxins by edible insects. <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> larvae were grown on wheat flour naturally contaminated with mycotoxins among which deoxynivalenol (DON) was predominant (4. 9 mg/kg), wheat flour spiked with 8 mg/kg pure DON, and uncontaminated wheat flour. Larval survival and weight gain on the three diets were compared. Survival was high for larvae on all dietary treatments (> 98 %) and no difference in weight gain was observed when comparing larvae grown on uncontaminated control diet with larvae grown on contaminated diets (P= 0. 091). Presence of mycotoxins in larvae and larval faeces was analysed using LC-MS/MS. No DON or DON-derivatives were detected in <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> after harvest of the larvae, pointing to degradation by the larvae. Excretion of DON in larval faeces was ca. 14 % of the amount of DON ingested for larvae grown on naturally contaminated diet and ca. 41 % for larvae grown on DON-spiked diet. These are promising results with respect to food safety of mealworms or derived products grown on mycotoxin-contaminated feed. However, enzymatic degradation of DON in <b>T.</b> <b>molitor,</b> as well as possible toxicity of the resulting metabolites, remain to be further investigated. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Some {{organisms that}} {{experience}} subzero temperatures, such as insects, fish, bacteria, and plants, synthesize antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that adsorb to surfaces of nascent ice crystals and inhibit their growth. Although some AFPs are globular and nonrepetitive, {{the majority are}} repetitive in both sequence and structure. In addition, they are fre-quently encoded by tandemly arrayed, multigene families. AFP isoforms from the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, are extremely potent and inhibit ice growth at temperatures below) 5 C. They con-tain a 12 -amino acid repeat with the sequence TCTxSxxCxxAx, each of which makes up one coil of the b-helix structure. TxT motifs are arrayed to form the ice-binding surface in all three known insect AFPs: the homologous AFPs from the two beetles, <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> and Dendroides canadensis, and the non-homologous AFP from the spruce budworm, Chori-stoneura fumiferana. In this study, we have obtained the cDNA and genomic sequences of additional <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> isoforms. They show variation {{in the number of}} repeats (from 6 to 10) which can largely be explained by recombination at various TCT motifs. In addition, phylogenetic comparison of the AFPs from the two beetles suggests that gene loss and amplification may have occurred after the divergence of these species. In contrast to a previous study sug-gesting that <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> genes have undergone positive Darwinian selection (selection for heterogeneity), we propose that the higher than expected ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitutions might result from selection for higher AT content in the third codon position...|$|E
40|$|The {{successive}} rearing of parasitoids in factitious hosts {{may affect}} its biological quality. Trichospilus diatraeae Cherian & Margabandhu, 1942 (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) {{has been studied}} for the biological control of sugarcane borer [Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius, 1794) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) ]. This study aimed to evaluate whether the rearing of T. diatraeae for three generations in the factitious host Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, 1758 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) affects its reproductive performance, when subsequently reared in the natural host pupae D. saccharalis. Two groups of T. diatraeae were reared separately for three generations: one in pupae of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> {{and the other in}} pupae of D. saccharalis. Subsequently, 20 pupae of D. saccharalis were exposed, for 72 hours, to the parasitism of T. diatraeae females reared earlier in pupae of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> or D. saccharalis. The successive rearing of T. diatraeae in the factitious host did not affect the number of pupae parasitized and the number of pupae in which the emergence of parasitoids occurred in the natural host D. saccharalis, and increased the longevity of females and the sex ratio of T. diatraeae. The progeny, duration of developmental cycle (egg to adult), width of head capsule of males and females and longevity of males of T. diatraeae were similar on both treatments.

The aim {{of this article is}} to evaluate the impact of food additives and surfactants in a concentration of 350 mg/kg of fodder on the body weight of third age Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, 1758 (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) larvae. A significant change in the body weight of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> larvae was observed when they consumed a diet containing 350 mg/kg of sodium glutamate, sodium cyclamate and sodium benzoate.
