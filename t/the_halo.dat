At low significance we detect a faint second peak in <b>the</b> radio <b>halo</b> close to <b>the</b> X-ray centroid of the smaller sub-cluster (the bullet) suggesting that, similarly to the X-ray emission, <b>the</b> radio <b>halo</b> may consist of two components. Finally, we find that the distinctive shape of the western edge of <b>the</b> radio <b>halo</b> traces out <b>the</b> X-ray detected bow shock. <b>The</b> radio <b>halo</b> morphology and <b>the</b> lack of strong point-to-point correlations between radio, X-ray and weak-lensing properties suggests that <b>the</b> radio <b>halo</b> is still being formed.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of the {{kinematic}} study of the extended gas in a sample of 10 high redshift radio galaxies (z 2. 5) based on high signal to noise Keck II and VLT long slit spectroscopy. In addition to the typical high surface brightness kinematically perturbed regions (FWHM and velocity shifts > 1000 km/s), we find in all objects giant low surface brightness halos which show quieter kinematics with typical emission line FWHM and velocity shifts of s̃everal hundred km/s. <b>The</b> giant <b>halos</b> often extend for more than 100 kpc and sometimes beyond the radio structures. Their emission line specta are typical of high redshift active galaxies.
