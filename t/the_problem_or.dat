500|$|A 2001 survey {{reported}} by Dr. Axel Hoffman showed that an Antoinist healer had received 216 patients {{over a period}} of twenty days, that the reasons to consultate were related to physical (47%), psychological (19%), sentimental (13%) and professional (13%) issues, and that most of these people also consulted a doctor. The Antoinist healing process does not include a doctrinal teaching nor a psychological manipulation. It does not necessarily imply the end of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> illness, and can be divided into three phases: the relief provided by the healer through listening and intercession with God, then acceptance of the problem which requires the recognition of one's responsibilities, and finally the inner peace that results. Whether immediate or gradual, healings are never considered as miracles in the religion because they are supposed to occur inevitably when all necessary conditions, including the faith of the patient, are met. Even after several consultations, the consultant does not necessarily become a follower. Several sociologists deemed the Antoinist healing as [...] "exorcist" [...] as well as [...] "adorcist".|$|E

50|$|A {{structured}} educational approach {{which consists}} of large and small group discussions (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Problem-based learning begins with an educator presenting a series of carefully constructed <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> issues to small groups of students (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> issues typically pertain to phenomena or events to which students possess limited prior knowledge (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). The first component of problem-based learning is to discuss prior knowledge and ask questions related to <b>the</b> specific <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> issues (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Following the class discussion, there is typically time in which students individually research or reflect on the newly acquired information and/or seek out areas requiring further exploration (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). After a pre-determined amount of time (as outlined by the educator), students will meet in the same small groups that were composed prior to the class discussion (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). In the first meeting, groups will spend between one and three hours further discussing <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> issues from class in addition to presenting any new information collected during individual research (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Following the first meeting, students will independently reflect on the group discussion, specifically in comparing thoughts regarding <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> issues in question (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Typically, groups will meet a second time to critically analyse individual and group thoughts and discussions and will attempt to synthesize the information in order to draw conclusions about <b>the</b> given <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> issue (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Within the educational setting, problem-based learning has enabled students to actively construct individual understandings of a topic using both prior and newly acquired knowledge (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007). Moreover, students also develop self-directed and group learning skills which ultimately facilitates the comprehension of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> issues (Schmidt & Loyens, 2007).|$|R

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E

While the APA guidelines list many other forms of contributions to a study that do not constitute authorship, it does state that combinations of these and other tasks may justify authorship.

2500|$|That {{being the}} case, it is {{necessary}} to determine whether there is a nonsafety rationale for 25524.2. California has maintained, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that 25524.2 was aimed at economic problems, not radiation hazards. The California Assembly Committee on Resources, Land Use, and Energy, which proposed a package of bills including 25524.2, reported that the waste disposal problem was [...] "largely economic or the result of poor planning, not safety related." [...] Reassessment of Nuclear Energy in California: A Policy Analysis of Proposition 15 and its Alternatives, p.18 (1976) (Reassessment Report) (emphasis in original). The Committee explained that the lack of a federally approved method of waste disposal created a [...] "clog" [...] in the nuclear fuel cycle. Storage space was limited while more nuclear wastes were continuously produced. Without a permanent means of disposal, the nuclear waste problem could become critical, [...] leading to unpredictably high costs to contain <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or,</b> worse, shutdowns in reactors. [...] "Waste disposal safety," [...] the Reassessment Report notes, [...] "is not directly addressed by the bills, which ask only that a method [...] be chosen and accepted by the federal government."

2500|$|Not {{surprisingly}} {{many cases}} go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company {{policy is the}} first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, [...] "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," [...] thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing [...] " [...] woman's purity," [...] the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with [...] "loose morals". Women would rather brush away <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, [...] "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." [...] The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan [...] "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and {{there is no guarantee that}} the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement." ...|$|E

[...] Many rich employers are too generous to do such a thing; many are too stupid {{to know what they}} are doing. The eugenical opportunity I have described is but an ultimate analysis of a whole drift of thoughts in the type of man who does not analyse his thoughts. He sees a slouching tramp, with a sick wife and a string of rickety children, and honestly wonders what he can do with them. But prosperity does not favour self-examination; and he does not even ask himself whether he means [...] "How can I help them?" [...] or [...] "How can I use them?"--what he can still do for them, or what they could still do for him. Probably he sincerely means both, but the latter much more than the former; he laments the breaking of the tools of Mammon much more than the breaking of the images of God. It would be almost impossible to grope in the limbo of what he does think; but we can assert that there is one thing he doesn't think. He doesn't think, [...] "This man might be as jolly as I am, if he need not come to me for work or wages." ...|$|E

60|$|Since we are {{continually}} discovering that uniformities, not previously {{known to be}} other than ultimate, are derivative, and resolvable into more general laws; since (in other words) we {{are continually}} discovering the explanation of some sequence which was previously known only as a fact; it becomes an interesting question whether there are any necessary limits to this philosophical operation, or whether it may proceed until all the uniform sequences in nature are resolved into some one universal law. For this seems, at first sight, to be the ultimatum toward which the progress of induction by the Deductive Method, resting on a basis of observation and experiment, is tending. Projects of this kind were universal in the infancy of philosophy; any speculations which held out a less brilliant prospect being in these early times deemed not worth pursuing.

Those who are concerned with the problems of public locomotion will be following these aeronautic investigations with a keen and enterprising interest, and so will the physiologist and the sociologist.
