50|$|The {{relative}} risk (RR), also called risk ratio, {{is simply the}} risk (probability) of an event relative to some independent variable. This measure of effect size differs from <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> that it compares probabilities instead of odds, but asymptotically approaches the latter for small probabilities. Using the example above, the probabilities {{for those in the}} control group and treatment group passing is 2/3 (or 0.67) and 6/7 (or 0.86), respectively. The effect size can be computed the same as above, but using the probabilities instead. Therefore, the {{relative risk}} is 1.28. Since rather large probabilities of passing were used, there is a large difference between relative risk and odds ratio.

However, low or fragmented DNA yields from buccal cells collected using FTA cards often requires additional whole genome amplification to produce sufficient DNA for genotyping. In our case–control study of childhood leukaemia, discordance was found between genotypes derived from blood and whole genome amplified FTA buccal DNA samples. We aimed to develop a user-friendly method to correct for this genotype misclassification, as existing methods were not suitable for use in our study. Methods Discordance between the results of blood and buccal-derived DNA was assessed in childhood leukaemia cases who had both blood and FTA buccal samples. A method based on applying misclassification probabilities to measured data and combining results using multiple imputations, was devised to correct for error in the genotypes of control subjects, for whom only buccal samples were available, to minimize bias <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case–control analysis. Results Application of the correction method to synthetic datasets showed it was effective <b>in</b> producing correct <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> from data with known misclassification. Moreover, when applied to each of six bi-allelic loci, correction altered <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> logically anticipated manner given the degree and direction of the misclassification revealed by the investigations in cases. The precision of the effect estimates decreased with decreasing size of the misclassification data set.

This paper {{argues that}} the use of <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> {{parameter}} <b>in</b> epidemiology needs to be considered with a view to the specific study design and the types of exposure and disease data at hand. Frequently, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> measure is being used instead of the risk ratio or the incidence-proportion <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> cohort studies or as an estimate for the incidence density <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> case-referent studies.

The odds ratio estimate in Table  5 for model 3 is 0.367 for LA exposure with a confidence interval from (0.337 – 0.400).

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a prospective case-control study among apparently healthy men and women nested in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort. Baseline concentrations of MBL were measured in serum samples of 946 patients who experienced a myocardial infarction or died of CAD during follow-up, and 1799 matched controls who remained free of CAD. Among men, median MBL levels were 1. 63 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR]: 0. 59 to 3. 80) in cases and 1. 20 ng/mL (IQR: 0. 48 to 3. 37) in controls. Among women, median MBL levels were 1. 02 ng/mL (IQR: 0. 43 to 2. 95) in cases and 1. 01 ng/mL (IQR: 0. 43 to 2. 94) in controls. After adjustment, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> men for future CAD was 1. 59 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 09 to 2. 32; P for linearity= 0. 01) for those in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile. In women no such relation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of MBL are associated with an increased risk of future CAD in apparently healthy men but not in women. The sex difference merits further exploratio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{takes up}} methods for Bayesian {{inference}} in a linear {{model in which}} the disturbances are independent and have identical Student-t distributions. It exploits the equivalence of the Student-t distribution and an appropriate scale mixture of normals, and uses a Gibbs sampler to perform the computations. The new method is applied to some well-known macroeconomic time series. It is found that posterior <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> favor <b>the</b> independent Student-t linear model over the normal linear model, and that <b>the</b> posterior <b>odds</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> favor of difference stationarity over trend stationarity is often substantially less in the favored Student-t models...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{globally}} accepted {{that women are}} {{integral part of the}} society and we should leave no stone unturned to empower them. In spite of this global consensus, {{in many parts of the}} world, women are marginalized and treated unequally. Nepal, one of the poorest countries by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, is not an exception and faces multitude of challenges with regard to women. Decade long civil war left many women widowed and made them even more vulnerable. The aim of this thesis is to assess the level of participation in decision making of those war widows from Nepal. The study is based on the primary data collected in from four districts in Nepal from November 2011 to February 2012. Participation in decision making is used as a dependent variable and four socioeconomic measures are used as independent variables. Binary regression model was used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final model. The results showed that human poverty measures affect the most in decision making among war widows in Nepal. Specifically, social restriction was found to be the main factor that is limiting participation in decision making. Lack of education and early age marriage were also found to diminish participation in decision making...|$|R
