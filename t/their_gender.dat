5|$|Final Fantasy XI is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG), and {{differs from}} previous {{titles in the}} series in several ways. Unlike the predefined main characters of previous Final Fantasy titles, players are able to customize their characters in limited ways, including selecting from one of five races and choosing <b>their</b> <b>gender,</b> facial style, hair color, body size, job, and nation allegiance. Also diverging from previous games in the series, the game {{takes place in a}} fully three-dimensional landscape with enemies freely roaming in it, allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to the random encounters used in previous games - a trend continued in every numbered Final Fantasy title since.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem is a {{tactical}} role-playing game which puts {{players in the}} role of a customizable Avatar: <b>their</b> <b>gender,</b> appearance, character class and statistics can be tailored by the player. Missions are split between story-based chapters and optional side chapters: side chapters give access to new playable characters outside the main narrative. Players can save at any time during battles, with the game opening offering a save {{at the end of each}} chapter. Outside battles, the player can visit towns to buy supplies and items such as weapons. Characters recruited by the player can also engage in support conversations accessed through the battle menu: these raise a character's support rank and grant boons during battle. How characters connect through supports is documented using a relationship chart.|$|E

5|$|The True Directions program {{involves}} the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering <b>their</b> <b>gender</b> identity by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding {{the root of}} their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over {{the course of the}} program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, a college student named Graham (Clea DuVall) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.|$|E
5|$|The {{expanding}} Piast state {{developed a}} professional military force. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Mieszko collected {{taxes in the}} form of weights used for trading and spent those taxes as monthly pay for his warriors. He had three thousand heavily armored mounted soldiers alone, whose quality according to Ibrahim was very impressive. Mieszko provided for all their equipment and needs, even military pay for their children regardless of <b>their</b> <b>gender,</b> from the moment they were born. This force was supported by a much greater number of foot fighters. Numerous armaments were found in the Piast gords, many of them of foreign, e.g. Frankish or Scandinavian origin. Mercenaries from these regions, as well as German and Norman knights, constituted a significant element of Mieszko's elite fighting guard.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of <b>their</b> <b>gender.</b>|$|E

However, Hermes and LaBarbara begin to miss the feeling of physical intimacy and demand the alien to restore <b>their</b> <b>genders.</b> The alien attempts to do so, but inadvertently switches <b>their</b> <b>genders.</b> Before the alien can fix its mistake, it is vaporized by Zapp Brannigan. Back at Planet Express, Leela and Amy {{take advantage of the}} contract clause to force the men-turned-women to pose for the calendar, and enough calendars are sold to save the business. Their celebrations are interrupted by the rock alien's friend, the Borax Kid, who restores everyone to <b>their</b> correct <b>genders</b> before leaving.

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of <b>their</b> <b>gender.</b> She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|In Fire Emblem Fates, {{the player}} begins by {{customizing}} the main character. <b>Their</b> <b>gender,</b> appearance, and name {{can be changed}} to the player's preference. At the game's beginning, there are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Lunatic. There are also modes that dictate the fate of characters in battle should they be defeated. In Classic Mode, a fallen unit is subject to permanent death, a recurring mode in the Fire Emblem series that removes fallen characters {{from the rest of}} the game. Casual Mode enables units to be revived at the end of a battle. The new Phoenix mode revives units on the following player turn. Each version of Fates is focused around a different gameplay style. The gameplay of Birthright is similar to the prior installment Fire Emblem Awakening and features opportunities to gain extra gold and experience. In contrast, Conquest rewards players limited experience and currency per completed map. Also included are additional objectives in battle such as defending a base or suppressing enemy forces, and some levels have a limited number of turns. Revelation uses a mixture of elements from Birthright and Conquest: while offering opportunities for gold and experience as with Birthright, it provides varied objectives and strategic elements similar to Conquest.|$|E
5|$|Playable {{starting}} officers include Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Guan Yu for the Shu Kingdom; Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, and Cao Cao for the Wei Kingdom; and Sun Shang Xiang, Huang Gai, and Sun Jian for the Wu Kingdom. It {{is possible}} to unlock new characters from other kingdoms as well as use a player created character {{in any of the}} campaigns. The new 'Edit Mode' allows players to create an officer from sets of different features, motions, and weapons to use in 'Kaiba Mode.' The characters stance and motion are affected by <b>their</b> <b>gender</b> and the weapon the player has selected them to carry and use. The motions for the weapons are taken from pre-existing officers as well as from two characters removed from Dynasty Warriors 4 that were in Dynasty Warriors 3: Fu Xi and Nu Wa. Some characters are unlocked by fulfilling optional side-goals; most are unlocked by completing certain battles during gameplay. The maximum number of playable characters is 42, 46 with created characters.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{modern day}} depictions have <b>their</b> <b>genders</b> change as well. In Tai Kato's 1963 jidaigeki musical film, Brave Records of the Sanada Clan, Kirigakure is a woman.

40|$|Building {{on recent}} {{investigations}} {{of the role of}} gendered discourses in constructing and maintaining sex-segregated professions this article highlights the significance of small story analysis for the identification of positioning acts which function as rhetorical warrants for career choices and trajectories. It analyses small stories told by Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) and investigates the tensions expressed in the negotiation and performance of <b>their</b> <b>gendered</b> professional identities. Small stories act as a medium of professional identity construction, rapport-building and as a site of contestation, employed to (re) appraise the social order, particularly with respect to 'women's' and 'men's' work. Gendered discourses are shown to impact not only on the amount of men entering the SLT profession but also the specialisms and progression routes that men and women pursue. The analysis points to the reproductive and regulatory power of gendered discourses on individuals' experience of <b>their</b> <b>gendered</b> subjectivity and professional identity...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the more}} known {{examples}} of a pseudo penis {{to occur in the}} insects is found in the species Neotrogla. In this species, the pseudo-penis plays a part in their rarely-seen sexual reversal. In this case, the male has a vagina-like structure while the female has a pseudo-penis. Some may be confused, wondering why the individuals with a vagina-like structure are considered male while the ones with the pseudo-penis are considered female. This is because even though they have visible outer structures of the opposite <b>gender,</b> <b>their</b> inner structures are consistent to <b>their</b> <b>genders.</b>|$|R
