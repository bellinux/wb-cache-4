40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} algebra of {{discrete}} timed input/output au-tomata that execute {{in the context}} of different clock granularities — <b>timed</b> <b>machines</b> — as models of systems that can be dynamically inter-connected at run time in a heterogeneous context. We show how <b>timed</b> <b>machines</b> can be refined to a lower granularity of time and how <b>timed</b> <b>machines</b> with different clock granularities can be composed. We propose techniques for checking whether <b>timed</b> <b>machines</b> are consistent or feasi-ble. Finally, we investigate how consistency and feasibility of composition can be proved at run-time without computing products of automata. ...|$|R
40|$|Closed timelike curves, or <b>time</b> <b>machines,</b> are objects within General Relativity. Such objects bring {{a myriad}} of unsolved paradoxes. Convincing and general {{arguments}} against <b>time</b> <b>machines</b> and their paradoxes are missing today in physics and philosophy. In this article, a philosophical argument against <b>time</b> <b>machines</b> is given. According to the presented argument, the unconscious belief in the principle of individuation motivates the belief in <b>time</b> <b>machines.</b> Then, assuming a process of individuation instead of a principle of individuation, one denies any type of human travel into the past.

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher {{attend a}} museum, where they {{discover}} a broken <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> {{built in the}} 1880s on display. Endeavoring to travel through time themselves, they begin fixing it to work properly. This catches the attention of their sister, Candace, who desires to inform their mother of their activities to get in trouble. When she finally gets their mother Linda to follow her and view the machine, Linda becomes distracted while Candace continues {{to walk to the}} boys, just as their <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> activates. The three are sent back to the Late Cretaceous Period (erroneously stated to be in 300 million B.C.), where a Tyrannosaurus rex immediately destroys the <b>time</b> <b>machine.</b> Now stranded, the three are forced to flee from the T. rex and are eventually saved by a herd of Alamosaurus lounging in a large pond.|$|E

As Dan finally confronts Palethorn, he steals the pages from him and uses them to summon a large blue demon. Dan manages to turn the demon against Palethorn, putting a stop to both of them. As Palethorn blows up his lair with his last breath, Dan decides to join Kiya in the afterlife as they return to their eternal rest. If the player has collected all the Chalices, Dan and Kiya go for a ride on the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> which takes them back to {{the time of the first}} MediEvil instead.|$|E

5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb {{learn from}} their friend Baljeet that a tool they need for their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need.

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} of a <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> {{powered by a}} gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged <b>time</b> <b>machine.</b> The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|Escaping Monarch {{during a}} time stutter, Jack rescues either Nick or Amy, {{students}} apprehended by Monarch who agree to help him. Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch, and learns that Paul was accidentally sent {{to the end of}} time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the path of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the following problem for various infinite <b>time</b> <b>machines.</b> If a real is computable relative to large set of oracles such {{as a set of}} full measure or just of positive measure, a comeager set, or a nonmeager Borel set, is it already computable? We show that the answer is independent from ZFC for ordinal <b>time</b> <b>machines</b> (OTMs) with and without ordinal parameters and give a positive answer for most other machines. For instance, we consider infinite <b>time</b> Turing <b>machines</b> (ITTMs), unresetting and resetting infinite <b>time</b> register <b>machines</b> (wITRMs, ITRMs), and α-Turing machines (α-TMs) for countable admissible ordinals α.

5|$|However, SERN learns of the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> {{and sends}} {{a group to}} {{retrieve}} it, killing Mayuri in the process. Using Kurisu's time leap machine, Rintarō travels back in time numerous times {{to try to save}} Mayuri, but to no avail. As Rintarō reaches wit's end, he is approached by Suzuha Amane, a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a <b>time</b> <b>machine,</b> who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta world line in which Mayuri won't die. By undoing the effects of the D-Mails that caused shifts in the time line, Rintarō regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier, allowing them to crack into SERN's systems and delete the evidence of Rintarō's original D-Mail. However, Rintarō realizes that by doing so, he would have to return to a world line in which Kurisu is dead. After realizing their feelings for each other, Kurisu tells Rintarō to save Mayuri. Reluctantly, Rintarō agrees and deletes the evidence of his D-Mail from SERN's database, returning him to the Beta world line.|$|E

5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Suzuha appears before Rintarō, having {{arrived in}} a <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> from the future. She tells Rintarō {{that the only way}} to prevent World War III in the future is to prevent Kurisu's death at the hands of her father, Dr. Nakabachi, who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name. However, this {{operation}} ends in a disaster as Rintarō ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake. After this failure, Rintarō receives a message from his future self, telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a <b>time</b> <b>machine</b> is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1.048596%, which he dubs the 'Steins Gate'. Returning to the past again, Rintarō puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu's life, prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory, and fool his past self, setting him on his journey through time. Returning to the Steins Gate world line, safe from the threat of a third world war, Rintarō and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance (or by fate) in the streets of Akihabara.|$|E
