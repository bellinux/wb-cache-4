40|$|The year 2001 {{marks the}} 80 th anniversary of Cardozo J 2 ̆ 7 s {{judgment}} in Wagner v International Railway Co 232 NY 176 (1921). This article examines theoretical and procedural {{problems associated with}} the concept of duty of care as a foundation for the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s liability in negligence to altruistic rescuers, and suggests that Cardozo J 2 ̆ 7 s judgment did not establish the principle that defendants owe rescuers a duty of care in negligence. It is argued that subsequent judgments failed to provide the duty of care owed to rescuers under <b>tortious</b> <b>negligence</b> with proper jurisprudential foundations. Conceptual difficulties inherent in a jurisprudential principle that would provide physically injured rescuers with a legal right to a duty of care from the defendant under the tort of negligence were compounded once compensation for negligently occasioned pure emotional distress became available. This article analyses various theories of recovery for pure psychiatric injury and the classification of rescuers into primary and secondary victims. It proposes a solution {{in the form of a}} separate cause of action on the case for liability to injured rescuers, partly based on the principle of necessity that governs the Roman action for negotiorum gestio. Cases from the United States, England and Australia are used to illustrate the similarities and differences in the development of and approaches to, the law of rescue. <br /...|$|E
5000|$|It is, no doubt, proper when {{considering}} <b>tortious</b> liability for <b>negligence</b> to analyse its elements {{and to say}} that the plaintiff must prove a duty owed to him by the defendant, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and consequent damage. But there can be no liability until the damage has been done. It is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is founded. ... Who knows or can be assumed to know all the processes of nature? But if it would be wrong that a man should be held liable for damage unpredictable by a reasonable man because it was [...] "direct" [...] or [...] "natural," [...] equally it would be wrong that he should escape liability, however [...] "indirect" [...] the damage, if he foresaw or could reasonably foresee the intervening events which led to its being done.|$|R
40|$|In 1948, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held in Newman v. Christensen that {{an injury}} occasioned by horseplay {{gave rise to}} a cause of action in {{negligence}} rather than battery, thus affording plaintiff a longer statute of limitations. In so doing, the court adopted the minority definitions of both assault and battery which require an intent to injure to be proved. This is an element of criminal law which is usually not carried over into tort law. This article compares intentional tort and negligence, showing that the 2 ̆ 2 horseplay 2 ̆ 2 case is and has been capable of being analyzed as a civil battery. The article also considers the practical differences in liability between intentional tort and negligence, concluding that although they might not be sufficient in Nebraska to require distinction between intentional <b>tortious</b> battery and <b>negligence</b> in this peculiar situation, the Nebraska plaintiff is denied a legitimate cause of action in the 2 ̆ 2 horseplay 2 ̆ 2 case...|$|R
40|$|All {{causes of}} action in tort, like all causes of action generally, are {{constituted}} by elements or ingredients. It {{is often the case}} that these elements are not crisply separated from each other. That is certainly so in relation to the cause {{of action in}} negligence, it having regularly been pointed out that none of its elements is self-contained. Denning L. J. took that view further than most. In Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 Q. B. 66, 86, he asserted: “you will find that the three questions, duty, causation, and remoteness, run continually into one another. It seems that they are simply three different ways of looking at one and the same problem. ” More commonly it is accepted that although the various elements of the tort of negligence overlap, they nonetheless retain separate identities. Thus, determining whether the tort of negligence has been committed is not generally understood as requiring a single homogeneous enquiry but an analysis whereby one examines each element of the action seriatim in order to determine whether it is present. This conventional understanding was embraced by Lord Simons, delivering the advice of the Privy Council in Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd. v Morts Dock and Engineering Co. Ltd. [1961] A. C. 388, 425, when he said: “It is, no doubt, proper when considering <b>tortious</b> liability for <b>negligence</b> to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove a breach of duty owed by him to the defendant, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and consequent damage. ...|$|R
40|$|Parental {{failure to}} {{adequately}} care for or supervise {{a child has}} recently come under scrutiny both in criminal and civil jurisdictions. While it was once thought that parents enjoyed a form of immunity from <b>tortious</b> liability in <b>negligence</b> for failing to adequately supervise their children, recent cases have highlighted the difficulty in distinguishing between commissions or positive acts (for which a parent may be liable) and omissions to act (where liability is more contentious). Parent’s and guardians also face the prospect criminal sanctions in circumstances where their failure to adequately care for or supervise a child results in harm to the child. There are {{a limited number of}} long standing authorities where a parent or guardian had been convicted following an extended period of neglect resulting in serious harm or even death to a child. It is not until recently however that the courts have considered the criminal responsibility of parent’s for momentary lapses of care resulting in less serious harm. These cases raise interesting questions as to the circumstances under which the responsibility for care of a child can be transferred from one carer to another {{and the extent to which}} an accused's status as a parent or guardian can be taken into consideration in determining whether criminal negligence has been established. This paper considers the various criminal offences that may arise from failure to adequately care for or supervise a child, the distinctions between criminal and civil liability in negligence, how it relates to a parent’s moral duty to care for their child and questions whether the law is moving towards too great a burden on the supervising parent...|$|R
