5|$|With the {{appropriation}} bills approved by both Houses, {{they were sent}} over to Yarralumla where Kerr gave them Royal Assent. With supply assured, he then received Fraser, who advised him that 21bills (including the electoral redistribution bills) which had been introduced since the last election fulfilled the double dissolution provisions of Section57. Fraser asked that both Houses be dissolved for an election on 13 December. Kerr signed the proclamation dissolving Parliament, and sent his Official Secretary, David Smith, to proclaim the dissolution from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>steps</b> of Parliament House.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>steps</b> of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of}} the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E

25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The north entrance {{was closed}} in the 1940s after <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>steps</b> were discovered to be sinking. The driveway {{in front of this}} entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance was used as the main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode the elevator to the roof. But he touched a power line as he climbed off the elevator, giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was {{closed in the}} 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} modern renaissance style, with the outside being composed entirely of red brick. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>steps,</b> the back steps, the columns, and the keystones are all constructed of stone, and the foundation is made of concrete and rubble sheathed with sandstone from the Calgary area. In the early years, {{the basement of the}} courthouse contained the jail cells, the caretaker’s residence, and the Northwest Mounted Police residence. The cells are in their original state, and still contain the original carvings prisoners etched into the brick walls. The caretaker looked after the building and the grounds while his wife looked after the family, as well as feeding the prisoners {{and the members of the}} Northwest Mounted Police housed there. In 1920, two German field cannons that were seized from Germany at the end of World War were placed on the front lawn of the Old Courthouse. These cannons, presented to the citizens of Wetaskiwin by the Dominion Government of Canada, served to honour the many men and women of this community who volunteered for active service.|$|E

500|$|Though the {{building}} had undergone previous alterations—for example, the Church Extension and Missionary Society had [...] "removed deteriorated parapets from the towers" [...] in 1880—it did not undergo significant renovations until the early 1890s. That year the rose window {{on the front of}} {{the building}} was removed, [...] "possibly because it had Christian motifs", and replaced with a large arched window, still in keeping with the Gothic style. The work was undertaken by the architectural firm of (Ernest) Schneider & (Henry) Herter, German immigrants who had worked on a number of other synagogues, including the Park East Synagogue. In 1893 they fixed [...] "serious structural problems", the consequence of neglected maintenance. The work included [...] "stabiliz <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>steps,</b> add brick buttresses to the sides of the church for lateral support, again in a Gothic style, and replac the original basement columns with six-inch cast iron columns."

500|$|In {{the later}} Tandy period (1946– 1949) and {{continuing}} throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less {{frequently in the}} center of the action. The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>steps</b> of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view. However, although Nancy [...] "expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation." [...] Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.|$|E
