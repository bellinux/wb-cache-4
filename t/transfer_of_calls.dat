40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the {{preferred}} signaling protocol for creating and terminating multimedia sessions in an IP network. Also, voice over IP is becoming the favored means of voice communication mainly because of its low cost when compared to voice communication over traditional networks like cellular and PSTN. Therefore, seamless <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> or handoff between the traditional and IP networks becomes important. We describe a technique to achieve seamless mid-call handoffs in a scenario where a handoff occurs between the cellular network and the IP network. The technique we describe makes use of a network element acting as an ISDN gateway, SIP conference server and SIP proxy server. We have measured handoff delays from IP to ISDN network and vice-versa. When using the proposed soft handoff technique, these delays are 0. 10 s and 0. 02 s, respectively. Finally, we share the results {{and some of the}} challenges we faced while implementing the overall mechanism on a dual-mode handset...|$|E

The squids for which mating {{has been observed}} use a hectocotylus, a modified arm, for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> sperm packets <b>called</b> spermatophores. However, many deep-sea squid species lack a hectocotylus. We present the first in situ observations of mating behavior in a deep-sea squid that has no hectocotylus but instead uses an elongated terminal organ for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> spermatangia, which are released from the spermatophores and burrow deeply into the female tissue. With remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), we observed two mating pairs of the deep-sea squid Pholidoteuthis adami in the Gulf of Mexico.

While the male held the female in {{what looked like a}} firm grip, we observed the long terminal organ extending through the funnel of the male, contacting the female dorsal mantle. Examinations of museum specimens show that spermatangia burrow from the outer dorsal mantle into the inner dorsal mantle.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} {{antibiotic}} treatment in pregnant women {{is to treat}} the mother and/or the fetus since {{it is known that}} antibiotics administered to the mother cross the placenta and reach the fetus. A comparison of the drug concentration in maternal and fetal plasma gives an indication of the exposure of the fetus to the maternally administered antibiotics. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} review the literature pertaining to the placental <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics in mail and to classify the antibiotics according to the type <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> involved. A table has been developed for use by physicians that lists the name of the antibiotic, the drug concentration in the cord and material plasma at delivery and the type <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> involved. Methods: An initial medline search was performed with the key words "placental <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics" with the limit of "human". A second medline search was performed with the key words "placental <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> [...] . " followed by the class names of the antibiotic such as penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and macrolides. The bibliographic search on the placental <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics covered the period up to July 2005. Results: 3 types <b>of</b> placental <b>transfers</b> were identified. A few antibiotics cross the placenta rapidly and equilibrate in the maternal and cord plasma; this type <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> is termed "complete" and include the antibiotics ampicillin, methicillin, cefmenoxime and cefotiam. Antibiotics which show incomplete transfer to the placenta where concentrations are lower in the cord than material plasma are said to have "incomplete" transfer and these include azlocillin, dicloxacillin, piperacillin, sulbenicillin, cefoxitin, amikacin, gentamicin, kanatnycin, streptomycin, fosfornycin, thiamphenicol, griseofulvin, vancomycin and colistimethate. Ceftizoxime is the only antibiotic so far known whose concentrations are higher in the cord than material plasma. This type <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> is <b>called</b> "exceeding" transfer. Conclusion: All examined antibiotics cross the human placenta including those with a molecular weight greater than 1000 kDa such as vancomycin and colistimethate but there are 3 distinct types of placental transfer: complete, incomplete and exceeding and most antibiotics exhibit incomplete transfer...|$|R

40|$|Early in F plasmid conjugative transfer, the F relaxase, TraI, cleaves one plasmid strand {{at a site}} {{within the}} origin <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>called</b> nic. The {{reaction}} covalently links TraI Tyr 16 to the 5 ′-ssDNA phosphate. Ultimately, TraI reverses the cleavage reaction to circularize the plasmid strand. The joining reaction requires a ssDNA 3 ′-hydroxyl; a second cleavage reaction at nic, regenerated by extension from the plasmid cleavage site, may generate this hydroxyl. Here we confirm that TraI is transported to the recipient during transfer. We track the secondary cleavage reaction and provide evidence it occurs in the donor and F ssDNA is transferred to the recipient with a free 3 ′-hydroxyl. Phe substitutions for four Tyr within the TraI active site implicate only Tyr 16 in the two cleavage reactions required for transfer. Therefore, two TraI molecules are required for F plasmid <b>transfer.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> TraI translocation on various linear and circular ssDNA substrates supports the assertion that TraI slowly dissociates from the 3 ′-end of cleaved F plasmid, likely a characteristic essential for plasmid re-circularization...|$|R
