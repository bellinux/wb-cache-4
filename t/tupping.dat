40|$|Gene {{duplication}} {{is considered}} an important evolutionary mechanism. Unlike many characterized species, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains two paralogous genes, <b>tup</b> 11 + and <b>tup</b> 12 +, that encode transcriptional corepressors similar to the well-characterized budding yeast <b>Tup</b> 1 protein. Previous reports have suggested that <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12 proteins play redundant roles. Consistently, we show that the two <b>Tup</b> proteins can interact together when expressed at normal levels and that each can independently interact with the Ssn 6 protein, as seen for <b>Tup</b> 1 in budding yeast. However, <b>tup</b> 11 − and <b>tup</b> 12 − mutants have different phenotypes on media containing KCl and CaCl 2. Consistent with the functional difference between <b>tup</b> 11 − and <b>tup</b> 12 − mutants, we {{identified a number of}} genes in genome-wide gene expression experiments that are differentially affected by mutations in the <b>tup</b> 11 + and <b>tup</b> 12 + genes. Many of these genes are differentially derepressed in <b>tup</b> 11 − mutants and are over-represented in genes that have previously been shown to respond to a range of different stress conditions. Genes specifically derepressed in <b>tup</b> 12 − mutants require the Ssn 6 protein for their repression. As for <b>Tup</b> 12, Ssn 6 is also required for efficient adaptation to KCl- and CaCl 2 -mediated stress. We conclude that <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12 are at least partly functionally diverged and suggest that the <b>Tup</b> 12 and Ssn 6 proteins have adopted a specific role in regulation of the stress response...|$|R
40|$|The Ssn 6 p-Tup 1 p {{corepressor}} {{complex is}} important to the regulation of several diverse genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and serves as a model for corepressor functions. To investigate the evolutionary conservation of these functions, sequences homologous to the S. cerevisiae <b>TUP</b> 1 gene were cloned from Kluyveromyces lactis (<b>TUP</b> 1) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (<b>tup</b> 11 +). Interestingly, while the K. lactis <b>TUP</b> 1 gene complemented an S. cerevisiae <b>tup</b> 1 null mutation, the S. pombe <b>tup</b> 11 + gene did not, even when expressed {{under the control of the}} S. cerevisiae <b>TUP</b> 1 promoter. However, an S. pombe <b>Tup</b> 11 p-LexA fusion protein repressed transcription of a corresponding reporter gene, indicating that this <b>Tup</b> 1 p homolog has intrinsic repressor activity. Moreover, a chimeric protein containing the amino-terminal Ssn 6 p-binding domain of S. cerevisiae <b>Tup</b> 1 p and 544 amino acids from the C-terminal region of S. pombe <b>Tup</b> 11 p complemented the S. cerevisiae <b>tup</b> 1 mutation. The failure of native S. pombe <b>Tup</b> 11 p to complement loss of <b>Tup</b> 1 p functions in S. cerevisiae corresponds to an inability to bind to S. cerevisiae Ssn 6 p in vitro. Disruption of <b>tup</b> 11 + in combination with a disruption of <b>tup</b> 12 +, another <b>TUP</b> 1 homolog gene in S. pombe, causes a defect in glucose repression of fbp 1 +, suggesting that S. pombe <b>Tup</b> 1 p homologs function as repressors in S. pombe. Furthermore, <b>Tup</b> 11 p binds specifically to histones H 3 and H 4 in vitro, indicating that both the repression and histone binding functions of <b>Tup</b> 1 p-related proteins are conserved across species...|$|R

The {{very high level of}} divergence in the histone interacting repression domains of the two proteins suggested that determinants distinguishing <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12 might be located in this domain. Here we have combined phylogenetic and structural analysis as well as phenotypic characterization, under stress conditions that specifically require <b>Tup</b> 12, to identify and characterize the domains involved in <b>Tup</b> 12 -specific action. The results indicate that divergence in the repression domain is not generally relevant for <b>Tup</b> 12 -specific function. Instead, we show that the more highly conserved C-terminal WD 40 repeat domain of <b>Tup</b> 12 is important for <b>Tup</b> 12 -specific function. Surface amino acid residues specific for the WD 40 repeat domain of <b>Tup</b> 12 proteins in different fission yeasts are clustered in blade 3 of the propeller-like structure that is characteristic of WD 40 repeat domains.

40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} the fission yeast Ssn 6 -Tup 11 /Tup 12 transcriptional corepressor which is involved in regulation of many genes important {{for a wide variety}} of processes. In contrast to the well characterised budding yeast <b>Tup</b> 1 protein there are two paralogous proteins present in fission yeast, namely <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12. We have shown that the two proteins can interact with each other and are expressed at similar levels, which is in line with a reported redundant function. Sequence analysis shows that the intermediate proposed histone interacting domain is highly variable between <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12 indicating a diversification. Interestingly, we show that <b>tup</b> 11 and <b>tup</b> 12 mutants have different phenotypes on media containing KC 1 and CaC 12. Consistent with this functional difference, we identify a number of target genes by genome wide expression profiling that are differentially affected by <b>tup</b> 11 - and <b>tup</b> 12. Many of these genes are <b>Tup</b> 12 dependent and correlate with genes that have previously been shown to respond to a range of different environmental stress conditions. The observed different physiological roles of <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12 can not be explained by differential recruitment of Ssn 6 which can interact independently with both <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12. Most interestingly we show that the Ssn 6 protein is essential in fission yeast and therefore must have a distinct role separated from <b>Tup</b> 11 and <b>Tup</b> 12. Surprisingly, a conditional ssn 6 HA-ts mutant displays the same growth phenotype as <b>tup</b> 12, indicating a role in <b>Tup</b> 12 dependent stress response. Consistent with the diverse phenotypes of the individual co-repressor proteins, we identify a group of genes that requires Ssn 6 for their regulation which is overlapping but distinct from the group of genes that depend on <b>Tup</b> 11 or <b>Tup</b> 12. Genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that Ssn 6 is almost invariably found in the same genomic locations as <b>Tup</b> 11 and/or <b>Tup</b> 12. All three co-repressor subunits are generally bound to genes that are selectively regulated by Ssn 6 or <b>Tup</b> 11 / 12, and thus, likely in the context of a co-repressor complex containing all three subunits. The co-repressor binds to both the intergenic and coding regions of genes, but differential localization of the co-repressor within genes does not appear to account for the selective dependence of target genes on the Ssn 6 or <b>Tup</b> 11 / 12 subunits. Ssn 6, <b>Tup</b> 11, and <b>Tup</b> 12 are preferentially found at genomic locations at which histones are deacetylated, primarily by the Clr 6 class I HDAC. A subset of co-repressor target genes, including direct target genes affected by Ssn 6 overexpression, is in addition associated with the function of class II (Clr 3) and III (Hst 4 and Sir 2) HDACs. Interestingly, many specific Hst 4 repressed ORF targets involved in amino acid biosynthesis are also direct targets for the Ssn 6 -Tup 11 / 12 co-repressor, suggesting an association with the class ill sirtuins which has not been reported previously...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{the proper}} {{expression}} of the transcriptome during development or {{in response to a}} changing environment requires a delicate balance between transcriptional regulators with activating and repressing functions. The budding yeast transcriptional co-repressor <b>Tup</b> 1 -Ssn 6 is a model for studying similar repressor complexes in multicellular eukaryotes. <b>Tup</b> 1 -Ssn 6 does not bind DNA directly, but is directed to individual promoters by one or more DNA-binding proteins, referred to as <b>Tup</b> 1 recruiters. This functional architecture allows the <b>Tup</b> 1 -Ssn 6 to modulate the expression of genes required for the response to a variety of cellular stresses. To understand the targeting or the <b>Tup</b> 1 -Ssn 6 complex, we determined the genomic distribution of <b>Tup</b> 1 and Ssn 6 by ChIP-chip. We found that most loci bound by <b>Tup</b> 1 -Ssn 6 could not be explained by co-occupancy with a known recruiting cofactor and that deletion of individual known <b>Tup</b> 1 recruiters did not significantly alter the <b>Tup</b> 1 binding profile.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis was directed towards {{the analysis of the}} inter-relationships between management practices and productive performance on a survey group of 30 north-east Wairarapa hill country farms. The initial survey, which essentially concentrated on the period between ewe weaning and <b>tupping,</b> incorporated a combination of mail and personal interview techniques. In addition, sample liveweights of ewe hoggets in autumn (April 1) and of two tooth and mixed aged (MA) ewes prior to mating were obtained to describe production levels more objectively. Preliminary results and appanent opportunities for improving the management of existing production systems were presented to the survey farmers as a group. As a consequence, a follow-up mail survey directed at management practices and associated production levels during the winter and spring (post-mating to weaning) was implemented in August 1983. Sample liveweights of ewe hoggets at spring shearing and ewe and lamb weights at weaning were collected. Results were discussed with the 29 participating farmers. Descriptive statistical methods (e. g. frequencies, cross-tabulation) were initially used to describe farm physical characteristics and the management systems employed. Subsequently, multivariate techniques (regression and MANOVA) were used to estimate the relative importance of different management strategies and farm physical characteristics on system performance. The major recommendation from this study is that increased emphasis should be placed on rearing ewe lambs so that they achieve a liveweight of 35 kg or more by May 1. The average April 1 ewe lamb liveweight on the survey farms in 1983 was 30. 2 kg (range, 18. 7 - 40. 0 kg). Other recommendations include mid-October or later commencement of calving, delaying ewe mating until April 1, earlier weaning of lambs and calves in dry summer areas (8 - 10 weeks and 12 weeks average age respectively) and increasing the winter rotation lengths of ewes. It is suggested that {{a large proportion of the}} potential level of production on hill country can be realised inexpensively through relatively small changes to existing management practices (such as those mentioned above) and associated management control of production system performance...|$|E

Animals that bore twin kids were heavier at <b>tupping</b> than animals that had single kids. The latter were heavier than animals that remained dry. The trial animals showed highly variable fleece characteristics between body positions on an animal and between animals. Responses to environmental and seasonal influences were highly variable. The trial goats had an S/P ratio of around 7, varying between 5 and 10. During spring the mohair fleece showed rudiments of a primitive type double coated fleece by growing kemps, fibres associated with the outer coat of primitive fleeces. The trial goats showed a shedding of the entire fleece by late spring. The trial goats had high fleece yields of around 90 %. The trial animals showed a marked seasonal rhythm of mohair production, with minimum production occurring in winter and maximum production occurring in late spring to early summer. Reproductive activities reduced annual mohair production by about 10 - 14 %. This reduction was brought about by a decrease in fibre diameter, a decrease in fibre length growth rate {{and an increase in}} the number of inactive follicles during winter and early spring. Fleece characteristics changed throughout the year. Average fibre diameter was lowest in winter and highest in spring. Average fibre length growth rate was lowest in winter and highest in summer. The number of growing fibres/unit area was highest in summer and lowest in winter. The degree of medullation (including kemps) was highest in spring and lowest in winter. Relationships between fleece characteristics varied considerably, however: -: average fibre diameter changes occurred prior to average length growth rate changes. -: average fibre diameter and average fibre length correlated positively. -: average fibre diameter and degree of medullation correlated positively. -: average fibre length growth rate and fibre length variation showed an inverse relationship. -: the number of growing fibres/unit area and the degree of medullation showed an inverse relationship. Kemp fibres grew predominantly along the backline and downward over the rump. Kemps grew excessively in spring and to a lesser degree in autumn. Kemps, though relatively few, had a marked influence on average fibre diameter. Angora Goats in Canterbury should be shorn early in spring and early in autumn in order to obtain mohair of high standard. Assessment of the degree of kemp and hairiness of animals should be carried out around late spring to early summer (December). Assessing the average fibre diameter of mohair is best done with a projection microscope on a midside sample, which should be collected in late summer. The C. S. I. R.

Interestingly, deletion of rst 2 (+), encoding a transcription factor controlled by the cAMP-dependent kinase, alleviated the <b>tup</b> 11 delta <b>tup</b> 12 delta defects in chromatin regulation but not in transcription repression. The chromatin at the M 26 site in mitotic cultures of a <b>tup</b> 11 delta <b>tup</b> 12 delta mutant resembled that of wild-type meiotic cells. These observations suggest that these fission yeast <b>Tup</b> 1 -like corepressors repress chromatin remodeling at CRE-related sequences and that Rst 2 antagonizes this function...|$|R
40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans {{serotype}} A strains, {{the major}} cause of cryptococcosis, are distributed worldwide, while serotype D strains are more concentrated in Central Europe. We have previously shown that deletion of the global regulator <b>TUP</b> 1 in serotype D isolates results in a novel peptide-mediated, density-dependent growth phenotype that mimics quorum sensing and is not known to exist in other fungi. Unlike for <b>tup</b> 1 strains of serotype D, the density-dependent growth phenotype {{was found to be}} absent in <b>tup</b> 1 strains of serotype A which had been derived from several different genetic clusters. The serotype A H 99 <b>tup</b> 1 strain showed less retardation in the growth rate than <b>tup</b> 1 strains of serotype D, but the mating efficiency was found to be similar in both serotypes. Deletion of <b>TUP</b> 1 in the H 99 strain resulted in significantly enhanced capsule production and defective melanin formation and also revealed a unique regulatory role of the <b>TUP</b> 1 gene in maintaining iron/copper homeostasis. Differential expression of various genes involved in capsule formation and iron/copper homeostasis was observed between the wild-type and <b>tup</b> 1 H 99 strains. Furthermore, the H 99 <b>tup</b> 1 strain displayed pleiotropic effects which included sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate, susceptibility to fluconazole, and attenuated virulence. These results demonstrate that the global regulator <b>TUP</b> 1 has patho-biological significance and plays both conserved and distinct roles in serotype A and D strains of C. neoformans. The fungal <b>Tup</b> 1 proteins function as global repressor...|$|R

40|$|Yeast mutants {{permeable}} to dTMP (<b>tup)</b> {{were selected}} and two new complementation groups (<b>tup</b> 5 and <b>tup</b> 7) were identified. Assay of {{the levels of}} both acid and alkaline phosphatase in cells grown under either repressing (5 mm PO 4 - 3) or derepressing (0. 03 mm PO 4 - 3) conditions indicated that, in general, <b>tup</b> mutations cause cells to be defective in their regulation of phosphatase synthesis. In addition, three of the <b>tup</b> mutations (<b>tup</b> 1, <b>tup</b> 4 and <b>tup</b> 7) displayed markedly elevated rates of inorganic phosphate transport. The <b>tup</b> 7 locus {{was found to be}} tightly centromere-linked on the right arm of chromosome XV, and was shown to be allelic with the pho 80 regulatory locus on the basis of both genetic and biochemical criteria. Analysis of other mutations known to affect phosphatase levels (pho) indicated that some also conferred permeability to dTMP. Possible allelic relationships between <b>tup</b> genes and certain of these pho mutations are discussed. Regardless of the culture conditions, wild-type strains were not permeable to dTMP; in contrast, it was found {{in the course of this}} work that normal yeast cells were permeable to dUMP and that dUMP permeability was regulated by the concentration of inorganic phosphate present in the medium used to grow the cells. Thus, permeability to 5 '-mononucleotides appears to be under coordinate control with phosphatase synthesis...|$|R
