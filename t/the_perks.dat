In our theory, bundling perks and cash compensation allows a firm to extract information rents from {{employees who have}} private information about their preferences for <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> and about their outside opportunities. We show that in maximizing profit with heterogeneous workers, the firm creates different bundles of <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> and salary in response to different employee characteristics and marginal costs of <b>the</b> <b>perk.</b> Our key result is that strategic bundling can lead firms to provide <b>perks</b> even in <b>the</b> absence of any cost advantage over the outside market and to deviate from the standard marginal cost pricing rule. We study how this deviation depends upon the set of feasible contracts, upon <b>the</b> <b>perk's</b> marginal cost, and upon {{the correlation between the}} agents' preferences for the good and their reservation utilities.

50|$|Translation Attenuation and Cell Cycle Arrest by <b>the</b> <b>PERK</b> Receptor This occurs {{within minutes}} to hours of UPR {{activation}} {{to prevent further}} translational loading of <b>the</b> ER. <b>PERK</b> (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) activates itself by oligomerization and autophosphorylation of the free luminal domain. The activated cytosolic domain causes translational attenuation by directly phosphorylating the α subunit of the regulating initiator of the mRNA translation machinery, eIF26. This also produces translational attenuation of the protein machinery involved in running the cell cycle, producing cell cycle arrest in <b>the</b> G1 phase7. <b>PERK</b> deficiency may {{have a significant impact}} on physiological states associated with ER stress.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to {{gender-related}} characteristics that is congruous with the person’s biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed <b>the</b> <b>perks</b> of androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about sex roles. Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests. This reinforces the idea that gender-typing does result in certain limitations towards the construction of one’s identity.|$|E
25|$|Most top Navy officers, however, were {{comfortable}} with the old system, enjoying <b>the</b> <b>perks</b> and the prestige the Navy provided. Life in the high echelons of the Spanish Navy was more glamorous than among Army and Air Force officers, for it often included Yacht Club membership, with regattas, gala dinners and balls. They cast a dim eye on the reforms {{of the armed forces}} introduced by newly nominated Republican Minister of War Manuel Azaña within {{the first few months of}} the new government. Azaña's aim was to modernize the Spanish Military and cut down the expenses of the state in the aftermath of the Great Depression, but the naming of Santiago Casares Quiroga, a civilian without a Navy background, as Minister of the Navy was unwelcome by the traditional Spanish Navy officers who despised Casares Quiroga and privately mocked him.|$|E
5000|$|Players {{select one}} of seven <b>perks</b> at <b>the</b> start of a match and between rounds. <b>The</b> <b>perk,</b> similar to <b>the</b> idea of a {{character}} class, provides bonuses towards certain weapon types, armor, movement, and other factors. Players can level up each <b>perk</b> to increase <b>the</b> benefits it offers. For example, the [...] "Sharpshooter" [...] perk, which provides accuracy benefits when using scoped rifles, can be raised in level by completing a number of headshots with specific weapons. The player {{does not need to}} play with that perk to raise its level. For example, <b>the</b> Field Medic <b>perk</b> requires <b>the</b> player to heal a number of points to level up, but this can also be done while playing any of <b>the</b> other <b>perks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Concerning {{business}} travel, [...] "The ease {{of international}} air travel {{and the fact}} that, for most of us, the costs are met by our employers, means that ... globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a <b>perk</b> of <b>the</b> job." [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> usually {{is not only the}} business trip itself, but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip, and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel. Thus a conflict of interest is established, whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary. Even when such conflict is not a motivation, <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> of frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds.|$|R

25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of <b>the</b> <b>perks</b> attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
25|$|PSV {{was founded}} by Philips {{and in the first}} decades, the club was only open to employees. The club did sign players from elsewhere, however; one of <b>the</b> <b>perks</b> of playing for PSV was that players who were offered a {{football}} contract were always offered a Philips job as well. Philips has been kit sponsor since 1982 and the PSV home ground has included the Philips name since its foundation. The company pays €7.5 million per year for the sponsoring and will remain kit sponsor until 2016. Frits Philips, chairman of the company between 1961 and 1971, became an icon for PSV during his lifetime. At five years of age, he conducted the ceremonial kick-off at the first Philips Elftal match in 1911. Frits Philips would become intertwined with PSV and Eindhoven; his 100th birthday was widely celebrated in the city. Frits Philips had his own spot in the stands until his death and would sometimes provide pep talks to the squad during half-time. PSV was often a way for Philips to introduce its technology to the public. In 1950, a match between PSV and FC Eindhoven was the first televised match in the Netherlands, with Philips supplying the technique. And in 1958, Philips installed four floodlights in the stadium.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{disturbances}} of the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) lead to {{activation of the}} unfolded protein response (UPR), which {{is involved in the}} consecutive steps of carcinogenesis. In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the UPR is shown to be activated; however, {{little is known about the}} UPR kinetics and effects of UPR modulation in HCC. We sequentially monitored the UPR over time in an orthotopic mouse model for HCC and explored the effects of UPR modulation on cell viability and proliferation in vitro and in the mouse model. The expression of ER-resident chaperones peaked during tumor initiation and increased further during tumor progression, predominantly within the nodules. A peak in Ire 1 signaling was observed during tumor initiation. <b>The</b> <b>Perk</b> pathway was activated during tumor progression, and the proapoptotic target Chop was upregulated from week 5 and continued to rise, especially in the tumors. The Atf 6 pathway was modestly activated only after tumor initiation. Consistent with the UPR activation, electron microscopy demonstrated ER expansion and reorganization in HCC cells in vivo. Strikingly, under ER stress or hypoxia, <b>the</b> <b>Perk</b> inhibitor and not the Ire 1 inhibitor reduced cell viability and proliferation via escalating proteotoxic stress in vitro. Notably, <b>the</b> <b>Perk</b> inhibitor significantly decreased tumor burden in the mouse model. We provide the first evaluation of the UPR dynamics in a long-term cancer model and identified a small molecule inhibitor of Perk as a promising strategy for HCC therapy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} work-related perks, such as corporate jets and limousines, nice offices, secretarial staff, etc., on the optimal incentive contract. In a linear contracting framework, perks characterized by complementarities between production and consumption improve the trade-off between incentives and insurance that determines the optimal contract for a risk-averse agent. We show that (i) <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> may be offered even if its direct consumption and productivity benefits are offset by its cost; (ii) <b>the</b> <b>perk</b> will be offered for free; (iii) agents in more uncertain production environments will receive more perks; (iv) senior executives should receive both more perks and stronger explicit incentives; and (v) better corporate governance can lead firms to award their CEOs more perks.
