50|$|<b>Teiidae</b> is {{a family}} of autarchoglossan lizards native to the Americas. Members of this family are {{generally}} known as whiptails or racerunners; however, tegus also belong to this family. <b>Teiidae</b> is sister to the Gymnopthalmidae, and both families comprise the Teiioidea. The <b>Teiidae</b> includes several parthenogenic species - a mode of clonal reproduction. Presently, the <b>Teiidae</b> consists of 151 species in eighteen genera.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Teiidae</b> contain 151 species {{divided into}} two subfamilies and {{eighteen}} genera. This assessment includes several recent changes: three resurrected genera, five newly described genera, and the large genus Cnemidophorus split into Aspidoscelis and Cnemidophorus. In some technical literature, the <b>Teiidae</b> {{are referred to as}} macroteiids (in opposition to the microteiids, which are members of a sister family Gymnopthalmidae). Parthenogenetic lineages are generally referred to as species, though the concept of a species is meant loosely. Other terms include array, clone, type, or morph.|$|E

50|$|Cnemidophorus is a genus of lizards in {{the family}} <b>Teiidae.</b> Species in the genus Cnemidophorus are {{commonly}} referred to as whiptail lizards or racerunners. Note that the Reeder et al. (2002) re-examined the nomenclature for this genus and split it into the two genera Aspidoscelis and Cnemidophorus.|$|E
5000|$|Pristiguana was {{discovered}} in the Bauru Group of Brazil. Its discoverers said, in 1973, {{that it is the}} oldest fossil lizard in the family Iguanidae. It resembles living primitive South American iguanids in [...] "some features". It shows [...] "similarity" [...] to members of the related family <b>Teiidae.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Spectacled lizards {{are related}} to the <b>Teiidae,</b> but they look like skinks (slightly more distant relatives) with smooth scales. They are {{generally}} small lizards; many species have reduced limbs. Unusually among lizards, however, it is generally the hind limbs that are reduced or absent, rather than the forelimbs.|$|E
50|$|Crocodilurus is {{a lizard}} genus {{that belongs to}} the family <b>Teiidae.</b> It is monotypic, with only a single {{described}} species Crocodilurus amazonicus, the crocodile tegu. This semi-aquatic lizard has a flattened, paddle-like tail and {{is found in the}} Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield in South America. It feeds on arthropods, amphibians, reptiles and fish.|$|E
50|$|Herbivory is rare {{in species}} outside the Iguania clade, but is present in {{isolated}} squamate groups. Within the Scincomorpha (a clade that includes skinks), herbivory independently evolves at least seven times. Specifically, herbivory independently develops {{at least once in}} the Lacertidae, Gerrhosauridae, <b>Teiidae</b> clades, and four times in the Scincidae (in the Corucia, Egernia, Macroscincus, and Tiliqua genera).|$|E
5000|$|Whiptail lizard (<b>Teiidae</b> genus) {{females have}} the ability to {{reproduce}} through parthenogenesis and as such males are rare and sexual breeding non-standard. Females engage in sexual behavior to stimulate ovulation, with their behavior following their hormonal cycles; during low levels of estrogen, these (female) lizards engage in [...] "masculine" [...] sexual roles. Those animals with currently high estrogen levels assume [...] "feminine" [...] sexual roles.|$|E
50|$|Ameiva cineracea, the Guadeloupe ameiva, was {{a species}} of <b>Teiidae</b> lizard that was endemic to Guadeloupe. It is known from {{specimens}} collected by early European explorers. The fossil record shows that it once ranged across Guadeloupe, La Désirade, Marie-Galante, and Îles des Saintes, but in most recent times it was restricted to Grand Ilet, just offshore of Petit-Bourg. Its extinction likely occurred when this area was decimated by a hurricane in 1928.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 {{a number}} of tegu species were {{reclassified}} from Tupinambis to the previously used genus Salvator. The newly proposed classification comes from a restructuring of the <b>Teiidae</b> family based upon the study of 137 morphological characteristics. The new classification is as follows: Salvator duseni (yellow tegu), Salvator rufescens (red tegu), Salvator merianae (black and white tegu), Tupinambis teguixin (gold tegu), Tupinambis longilineus (Rhondonia tegu), Tupinambis palustris (swamp tegu), Tupinambis quadrilineatus (four-lined tegu).|$|E
5000|$|The Saint Lucia whiptail or Vanzo's whiptail (Cnemidophorus vanzoi [...] ) is {{a species}} of lizard in the <b>Teiidae</b> family. The species is endemic to Saint Lucia, {{where it has been}} extirpated from the main island and is now only native to the small islets of Maria Major and Maria Minor, with fewer than 1,000 {{individuals}} estimated. A third population has been established on nearby Praslin Island through translocation. It is the only species of Cnemidophorus found in the Caribbean.|$|E
5000|$|The Martinique giant ameiva (Ameiva major) was {{a species}} of lizard in the <b>Teiidae</b> family.It is {{believed}} to have been endemic to Martinique, though at least one scholar disputes this, instead placing it on Les Iles de la Petite Terre within the Guadeloupean archipelago. [...] It is known only from museum specimens collected by early European explorers. Its extinction may have been caused by a hurricane, or through the introduction of predatory species to the island.|$|E
50|$|Lacertoids {{have a wide}} {{geographic}} distribution. The Lacertidae {{are found}} throughout Europe and Asia, with a major radiation endemic to Africa. The <b>Teiidae</b> are diverse in South America, but {{some members of the}} group occur in southern North America as well. The Amphisbaenia are especially widespread, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. The origins of the group are unclear. The oldest definitive lacertoid is the amphisbaenian Plesiorhineura, from the early Paleocene of North America. Given that it resembles modern worm lizards, the lacertoids most likely appeared and diversified in the Cretaceous.|$|E
50|$|Tupinambis is {{a lizard}} genus which {{belongs to the}} family <b>Teiidae,</b> and {{contains}} seven described species. These large lizards are {{commonly referred to as}} tegus (teiús in Portuguese); T. merianae (Argentine black and white tegu), T. rufescens (red tegu), and T. teguixin (gold tegu) are popular in the pet trade. They are primarily found in South America, although T. teguixin also occurs in Panama. Tegus that have escaped or have been illegally released have adapted and are increasing in several Florida counties including rural and suburban (especially south Miami-Dade and Hillsborough) counties, agricultural areas (especially Homestead and unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida) and publicly owned conservation areas (especially Southern Glades Environmental and Wildlife Area and southeast margin of Everglades National Park) of South Florida See invasive species website (www.IVE-GOT-1.org) for details with specific locations of credible observations and voucher specimens.|$|E
50|$|The Western {{pond turtle}} is an endemic species to the Arroyo Conejo and other creeks. Newbury Park {{is home to}} an {{abundance}} of reptiles, including lizards such as the Western fence lizard, Coast horned lizard, Common side-blotched lizard, Southern alligator lizard, <b>Teiidae</b> and the California legless lizard. There are eleven species of snake recorded in the Greater Thousand Oaks Area: Southern Pacific rattlesnake, Ring-necked snake, Western yellowbelly racer, California whipsnake, Coachwhip, Gopher snake, California kingsnake, Two-striped garter snake, Western Black-headed Snake, Lyre snake, and Night snake. Thousand Oaks proper is home to 171 recorded species of birds, including seventeen raptors such as the Barn owl, Cooper’s hawk, American kestrel, Prairie falcon, Red-shouldered hawk, Golden eagle, Great horned owl, White-tailed kite, California vulture, Northern harrier, Sharp-shinned hawk, Ferruginous hawk, Merlin and Screech owl. Commonly encountered bird species include the House sparrow, House finch, Brewer's blackbird, Common raven, California towhee, Acorn woodpecker, California quail, and the Red-tailed hawk.|$|E
