5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities.</b> The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E
25|$|From its {{earliest}} days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade. During {{most of the}} 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville the only port allowed to trade with the colonies, to Lima, Peru and from it to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products took {{a very long time}} to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among porteños towards the Spanish authorities.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time, {{large amounts of}} federal money went to public schools. In {{practice}} ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities). For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities)</b> received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 {{it was reported that}} {{less than half of the}} funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the daily realities of childhood in <b>the</b> Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city,</b> investigating how <b>the</b> children understand and negotiate the possible dangers and probable safeties of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> Growing up in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> is an image few think is possible. However, throughout my research I will argue for a conceptualisation of childhood that speaks to the urban public spaces in <b>the</b> Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> and an <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> that speaks to the a new childhood in South Africa. I have used danger and safety negotiation as the bridge between studies of <b>the</b> Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> and studies of a South African childhood, and as a bridge in the gap between theories on childhood and theories on the city. I investigate the ways that the children negotiate the everyday dangers in the city and develop practices of safety, and how these practices and avoidance techniques speak to the reality of living in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> very nature of <b>the</b> congested <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> offers a freedom that many suburban childhoods lack, and that the children experience an independent mobility within an infamously dangerous space speaks to the changes within <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> often hidden behind the skewed opinion of many of <b>the</b> Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> I make a claim that <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> offers more freedom of mobility that is expected. This mobility is a relatively simple and well practiced form of creating visibility within the pedestrian congestion of the city. These practises of visibility, I argue, is heavily reliant on the layout of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> and <b>the</b> ways in which children understand the dangers that face them. As such, their safety practices are a complex network of sharing cautionary stories and avoidance techniques. For most children, this environment is also the only space that they know and therefore, what to outsiders might seem a dangerous, chaotic and confusing space is to the children just their everyday experience. These are the stories about which I write...|$|R

During the campaign, Jackson began speaking about a [...] "Rainbow Coalition", an idea created by Fred Hampton, regarding the disadvantaged and welcomed voters from a broad spectrum of races and creeds. The goals of the campaign were to demand social programs, voting rights, and affirmative action for all groups that had been neglected by Reaganomics. Jackson's campaign blamed President Ronald Reagan's policies for reduction of government domestic spending, causing new unemployment and encouraging economic investment outside of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> while they discouraged the rebuilding of urban industry. The industrial layoffs caused by these policies hit the black and other minority populations particularly hard. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention on July 18, 1984, in San Francisco, California, Jackson delivered an address entitled [...] "The Rainbow Coalition". [...] The speech called for Arab Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, youth, disabled veterans, small farmers, lesbians and gays to join with African Americans and Jewish Americans for political purpose. Whereas the purpose of PUSH had been to fight for economic and educational opportunities, the Rainbow Coalition was created to address political empowerment and public policy issues.

2500|$|One team {{of writers}} have {{analyzed}} {{the building of}} the Interstate Highway System, and have concluded that it [...] and other policies of the Federal government {{played a significant role in}} American suburbanization. The building of an efficient network of roads, highways and superhighways, and the underwriting of mortgages for suburban one-family homes, had an enormous influence on the pace of suburbanization. In effect, the government was encouraging the transfer of the middle-class population out of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> and into the suburbs, sometimes with devastating effects on the viability of the city centers. However, some argue that the effect of Interstate Highway Systems on suburbanization is overstated. Researchers holding this view believe city center populations would have declined even in the absence of highway systems, contending that suburbanization is a long-standing and almost universal process. They primarily argue that as incomes rise, most people want the range and choice offered by automobiles. In addition, there is no significant evidence directly linking the development of highway systems to declining urban populations.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1884 Queen Victoria {{intervened in}} what was rapidly {{becoming}} a constitutional crisis, urging the party leaders to meet and break the deadlock. Negotiations duly started at Salisbury's London home in Arlington Street, Westminster, between the Conservative leader and Sir Charles Dilke, a member of Gladstone's cabinet. Lord Salisbury agreed to allow the reform bill to pass on condition that a bill to redistribute parliamentary seats was also enacted; the two parties reached an agreement, the [...] "Arlington Street Compact", whereby the bulk of MPs would be elected in single-member constituencies. He calculated that this would minimise the adverse effect on the Conservatives of {{the extension of the}} vote: dividing the counties would allow Liberal-voting and Conservative-voting districts to be separated. The division of boroughs would allow the suburban areas of towns to be represented separately from <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> allowing the growth of [...] "Villa Toryism". Dilke, a member of the Radical (socially progressive) wing of the Liberal Party, also favoured the division of boroughs to weaken the influence of the Whig faction in the party. Before 1885 many existing two-member boroughs one Whig and one Radical were nominated by agreement, often leading to uncontested elections.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1940 anti-Semitic laws started to come into force in both the {{occupied}} and unoccupied zones. On 3 October 1940 Vichy introduced the statut des Juifs, requiring all Jews in France to register with the authorities and banned Jews from professions such as the law, the universities, medicine and the public service. Jewish businesses were [...] "Aryanized" [...] by being placed in the hands of [...] "Aryan" [...] trustees who engaged in the most blatant corruption while Jews were banned from cinemas, music halls, fairs, museums, libraries, public parks, cafes, theatres, concerts, restaurants, swimming pools and markets. Jews could not move unless informing the police first, own radios or bicycles, were denied phone service, could only use phone booths marked Accès interdit aux Juifs and were only allowed to ride the last carriage on the Paris Metro. The French people at the time distinguished between the Israélites (a polite term in French) who were [...] "properly" [...] assimilated French Jews and the Juifs (a derogatory term in French) who were the [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "unassimilated" [...] Jews who were widely seen as criminals from abroad living in slums in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> of France. All through the 1930s, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe was vastly exaggerated, and popular opinion believed that the majority of Jews living in France were illegal immigrants who were causing all sorts of social problems. In a context where the number of Jews in France, and even more so the number of illegal Jewish immigrants were much exaggerated, Ousby noted about the introduction of the first anti-Semitic laws in 1940: [...] "There was no sigh of public opposition to what was happening, or even widespread unease at the direction in which events were heading [...] [...] [...] Many people, perhaps even most people, were indifferent. In the autumn of 1940 they had other things to think about; later they could find little room for fellow-feeling or concern for the public good in their own struggle to survive. What happened to the Jews were a secondary matter; it was beyond their immediate affairs, it belonged to that realm of the 'political' which they could not longer control or even bring themselves to follow with much interest".|$|E
