5|$|Southern grey desert foxes {{include the}} Asian {{subspecies}} V.v.griffithi, V.v.pusilla, and V.v.flavescens. These foxes display transitional features between northern red foxes and smaller fox species; their skulls possess more primitive, neotenous traits than the northern forms, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> smaller; the maximum sizes attained by southern foxes are invariably {{less than the}} average sizes of northern foxes. Their limbs are also longer, and their ears larger.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|The bald eagle's {{natural range}} covers most of North America, {{including}} most of Canada, {{all of the}} continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. Today, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more common (almost attaining their peak numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less stable.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E
5|$|Polonium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though its metallic character {{resembles that of}} its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table: thallium, lead, and bismuth. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138days) in uranium ores, {{as it is the}} penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.|$|E

5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a {{sedentary}} lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E

5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved {{by the actions of}} only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E

25|$|The cello is {{typically}} made from carved wood, although other {{materials such as}} carbon fiber or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a spruce top, with maple for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as poplar or willow, are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of laminated wood. Laminated cellos are widely used in {{elementary and secondary school}} orchestras and youth orchestras, because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., {{they are less likely to}} crack if bumped or dropped) and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less expensive.|$|E
