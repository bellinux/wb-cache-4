500|$|The Malayan {{government}} was not keen on having the Chinese Singaporean population push the Malays into a minority position in the new Malaysia. Many Malays felt that upsetting the Malay-dominated nature {{of the armed forces}} and police might place them in a dangerous situation. It was also argued that the inferior economic position of the Malays would be emphasised by the entry of even more rich Chinese, setting the stage for major discontent. The Malayans decided to resolve this by merging with Sabah and Sarawak; both British colonies had large native populations whom the government considered [...] "Malay". Under Article 160 of the Constitution, most of them were not Malay; the natives were mainly animists or Christians instead of Muslims as required. <b>To</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> the government expanded its informal definition of [...] "Malay" [...] to include these people.|$|E
500|$|In 1908 Lang was {{nominated}} as Archbishop of York, despite his relatively junior {{status as a}} suffragan rather than a diocesan bishop. His religious stance was broadly Anglo-Catholic, tempered by the liberal Anglo-Catholicism advocated in the Lux Mundi essays. He consequently entered the House of Lords as a Lord Spiritual and caused consternation in traditionalist circles by speaking and voting against the Lords' proposal to reject David Lloyd George's 1909 [...] "People's Budget". This radicalism was not maintained in subsequent years. At {{the start of the}} First World War, Lang was heavily criticised for a speech in which he spoke sympathetically of the German Emperor.

After the war he began to promote church unity and at the 1920 Lambeth Conference was responsible for the Church's Appeal to All Christian People.

500|$|The Netherlands relinquished its {{territorial}} {{claims in}} the archipelago (with the exception of West Papua) following the 1949 Round Table Conference, {{which is the same}} year that the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, allowing the Communist Party of China to take control of mainland China. Most Chinese Indonesians considered a communist China less attractive than a newly independent Indonesia, but in the archipelago their loyalties were questioned. Ethnic Chinese born in the Dutch East Indies whose parents were domiciled under Dutch administration were regarded as citizens of the new state according to the principle of jus soli, or [...] "right of the soil". However, Chinese law considered a person as a Chinese citizen according to the principle of jus sanguinis, or right of blood. This meant that all Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent were also claimed as citizens by the People's Republic of China. After several attempts by both governments <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> Indonesia and China signed a Dual Nationality Treaty on the sidelines of the 1955 Asian–African Conference in Bandung.

500|$|The {{progress}} of Fusōs construction, while the IJN {{waited for the}} funding to be released and foreign developments, caused the IJN to reassess the Fusō-class design. The distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated {{the protection of the}} midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired. Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the [...] shells used in the manually loaded [...] secondary guns used in the Fusō class and earlier designs. <b>To</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> the IJN designed a smaller [...] gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire. It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British s and Russian s. For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by [...] to [...] To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the Fusō class. This reduced the crew's accommodations despite {{a significant increase in the}} crew's numbers and naval historian Fukui Shizuo believed that these ships had the worst habitability of any Japanese capital ship.

40|$|Abstract. Modelling {{a finite}} {{population}} genetic algorithm (GA) as a Markov chain can quickly become unmanageable since {{the number of}} population states increases rapidly with the population size and search space size. One approach <b>to</b> <b>resolving</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> is <b>to</b> “lump ” similar states together, so that a tractable Markov chain can be produced. A paper by Spears and De Jong in [1] presents an algorithm {{that can be used}} to lump states together, thus compressing the probability transition matrix. However, to obtain a lumped model, one needs to calculate the exact transition matrix before the algorithm can be applied to it. In this paper, we explore the possibility of producing a reduced Markov model without the need to first produce the exact model. We illustrate this approach using the Vose model and Spears lumping algorithm on the Onemax problem with a selection-mutation GA. ...|$|R
