40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the behaviour, {{influence and}} role of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> in tradable permits markets. Following the literature, it focuses on a framework {{in order to understand}} how society and <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> react against the firms' emissions due to their participation in the tradable permits' market. Therefore the paper reveals the tradable permits mechanism as a new way for public direct action and highlights the possible benefits for the regulator. An important part of the <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> consists of the very active participation of the Environmental Non Governmental Organisations. Therefore, this paper argues that the <b>third</b> <b>party's</b> <b>participation</b> and specifically the environmental groups' participation in tradable permits' market could drive the market to the optimum equilibrium. In order to examine this "proposition" we use some data from {{the first phase of the}} permits' market in European Union and some available data for the environmental groups' income. We conclude that the environmental groups could purchase the exceeded, overallocated permits and could drive the market in the equilibrium point. Finally, for the regulator the environmental groups' participation could be desirable given that they could improve the efficiency of the tradable permits market. ...|$|R

Our findings suggest that motivation and ability related factors might play both an enabling and inhibiting roles in e-market adoption.

40|$|How is two-party electoral {{competition}} {{influenced by}} <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> even under normal political conditions? I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. House elections by inducing anticipatory strategies by the major parties. This strategic framework for understanding <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> stresses two things. First, one should focus on the major parties in order to gauge the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Second, one should not conclude that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> are irrelevant because of their minimal electoral success. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> effects are in fact present even in elections where a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> does not enter.

In South Australia, the Mining Act 1971 (SA) and Mining Regulations 2011 (SA) together constitute the main statutory regime for protecting the environment from mining activities. While {{the creation of a}} separate set of environmental controls within the Mining Act means that a number of key environmental statutes do not generally apply to activities undertaken pursuant to licences or leases under the Mining Act, the legal position regarding environment protection is more complex than this statement suggests. This article's critique of the regime focuses on issues of compliance and enforcement. First, assuming that a robust system of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>participation</b> is fundamental to a truly rigorous compliance and enforcement regime, it critically assesses the adequacy of rights of third party public participation in the assessment, decision and review of mining proposals.

In this paper, we combine the new buyer's secret key, the new buyer's watermark to embed in resold digital content, and the reseller's encrypted watermark, which can prove legal ownership of the reseller. Using the privacy homomorphism property of RSA and exponential calculus, the original seller of digital content can verify {{the legality of the}} reseller and the new buyer. We also reduced the load of encryption/decryption digital content using a partial encryption/decryption algorithm to make our protocol more efficient and practical. In the proposed protocol, the seller is not able to conduct piracy and easily frame any other innocent secondhand buyer when a case of piracy is found. In fact, piracy can be clearly traced using the privacy homomorphism property of RSA and the embedded watermark mechanism. Further, in the proposed protocol, the seller himself can trace the piracy using exponential calculus.

To facilitate this interoperation, dynamic discovery and selection of services is required. Existing distributed {{solutions for the}} dynamic discovery of services primarily focus on the deployment of directory, broker and matchmaking intermediaries, requiring <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>participation</b> and additional infrastructure costs. The selection of Web services by autonomous actors has become a well-developed area of research. Service-oriented architectures can now provide for complex interactions described by semantically rich process models, thereby enabling consumption by autonomous agents. With distributed agent-based architectures becoming common, academics are increasingly looking towards norm-based approaches to offer flexible control of interacting agents. Current semantically aware service selection methods rely on matching inputs and outputs provided by services profile models. This approach typically fails to allow actors to differentiate between services where the profile models may match, but the process models differ. In this research, the question is asked: How can an actor {{with a set of}} known normative beliefs use these beliefs to aid service selection where IOPE matching typically falls short? The following have been created: a model, a language and a module for the norm-based scoring of process denitions. In doing so it is shown that social norms can be used by actors to reason over the potential cost of any interaction and that this metric can provide useful context when selecting partners where the services' basic inputs and outputs may match, but process model specifications may not. <br/...|$|E

These exchanges, produced by recent health care reform legislation, will amass an unprecedented amount of clinical information on drug usage, demographic variables, and patient outcomes.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of Mexico {{is the development of}} its Petroleum System. A mixture of a bad administration, corruption and a highly restricted juridical scheme has, technically and financially, collapsed the industry. At the present situation, Mexico not only needs foreign and local investors but also experienced players {{due to a lack of}} economic resources and technical expertise, especially on deep waters petroleum exploitation. The main legal problem is the Mexican constitutional framework that reserves for the state the monopoly of the petroleum industry, practically in all its areas. In this context, Mexico has had to create some sui-generis models, Multiple Service Contracts and Pidiregas, for <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>participation</b> in its restricted petroleum industry with a mild success. These models have raised strong questions on their legality and long-term viability. Nevertheless, their importance and function in the Mexican Petroleum Industry is undeniable. Thus, a juridical study is fundamental to understand their reaches and possibilities for <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>participation.</b> On this context, another essential issue would be to contemplate a change in the Mexican constitution, especially on the art. 27 fourth paragraph not only to open the petroleum industry to private players but also to set the legal framework towards the adoption of a more convenient petroleum model. Mexico has the second largest proven crude oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere after Venezuela. In 2006, Mexico produced about 3. 25 million barrels per day, 2. 3 % less than the previous year, equivalent to 77 000 barrels less per day. This information confirms the expected decline in the production of oil. If the production continues at the same rate, with the same petroleum model, the oil would only last for 9 more years. However, Mexico ranked as the world's fifth-largest oil producer, with proven reserves of 12. 9 billion barrels. Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the state oil enterprise, is one of the world's largest oil companies, the single most important entity in the Mexican economy, and a symbol of Mexican sovereignty and independence. Constitutionally, Pemex has exclusive rights to oil exploration and production (E&P) that have fostered its position internationally. Nonetheless, Pemex has been suffering years of corruption and a lack of: competitiveness, expertise, investment and new potential discoveries. This scenario can be substantially improved on the medium-term by adopting the correct petroleum model. As a consequence, Pemex needs a structural and qualitative change to meet the economic and energy production expectations of Mexico and the global market. In this situation, it is necessary to look into the international arena to find a convincing and attractive model that would allow the nation to develop its industry into a successful public/private model, the Norwegian License System. Nowadays, Mexico considers the liberalization of its petroleum sector as a fundamental point in its foreign and internal policy due to comprehensible reasons. The Norwegian Government has let foreign companies carry out petroleum activities through a license system without losing the control of the sector. As a result, the cooperation and competition between private and public sectors in the Norwegian Continental shelf has fostered the industry into becoming one of the leading actors worldwide in the exploitation of offshore deep water wells. The model establishes a strong state control over all the phases of the process with transparency and predictability as pillars for its good performance. Moreover, the system lets the Norwegian government act as a passive/active owner with a main state petroleum company, Statoilhydro, that participates in, practically, all the projects. The Norwegian State receives a substantial part of the revenues while at the same time assures tax reductions, depending on the associated cost of the petroleum production. The Norwegian license system shows that the public and private sectors can work together in a convenient model for both actors, even if they seem to have opposite interests. All these factors have made the Norwegian Petroleum Model a highly attractive structure for the liberalization of the Mexican Oil Industry. The historical opportunity for Mexico to develop its petroleum industry needs a legal analysis of the models that allow <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>participation</b> in the Mexican Petroleum System, their reaches, downs turns and historical facts. Therefore, first, I present a brief synopsis of the Mexican and Norwegian Petroleum Sectors, from their beginnings to their current position, to have a better view of both petroleum industries. Second, I study the legal difficulties connected with the private participation models in the Mexican Petroleum Industry, Multiple Service Contracts and Pidiregas Models, and particularly the problematic associated with the Mexican Constitutional Framework. Third, I present the legal possibility for Mexico to adopt a Norwegian Petroleum Based System. At the present conditions, it is not feasible to foster the petroleum sector in Mexico. The political, economical and social conditions of my country demand, rather sooner than later, a change on the energy model. In the Mexican reality, there is no other economic engine as important as petroleum; thus, it is necessary to study and protect the Mexican petroleum industry, to assure the present and future of the nation...|$|E
30|$|According to {{the model}} of {{constrained}} agency firms actively create, perpetuate, and modify network structure by acquiring, activating, altering, and adjusting relationships (see Gulati and Srivastava 2014). Firms take actions through the choices they make regarding given interorganizational ties. Network positions determine firms’ resources at hand and shape their motivations to employ these resources. This constrained agency is expressed by network actions, which subsequently can alter firms’ initial position in interorganizational networks. The question of forming new ties or dropping old ones becomes therefore a strategic matter {{with respect to the}} design of digital platforms (e.g. Evans and Schmalensee 2016; Gawer 2009). Digital platforms connect actors by facilitating their value co-creating activities that shape the structure of certain digital ecosystems. A platform creates value by attracting third parties (e.g. customers, business partners, research companies etc.) to use the platform for applying and integrating their resources. Platform owners govern relationships and control with whom to establish ties by deploying technical boundary resources (Eaton et al. 2015; Ghazawneh and Henfridsson 2013). <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>participation</b> enhances functionality and network effects and, thereby, allows owners to increase the value of their platforms (Gawer and Cusumano 2002, p. 6). Firms take network actions by leveraging their resources through the platform in order to increase their own performance (Ceccagnoli et al. 2012, p. 267). Thus, the structure of digital ecosystems enables firms to acquire, activate, alter, and adjust ties. Simultaneously, the structure shapes motivation to do so. As a consequence, the ecosystem structure itself tends to constantly change.|$|E
