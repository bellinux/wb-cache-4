25|$|In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the US Supreme Court {{ruled that}} Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions {{applied to all}} detainees in the War on Terror. It said that the {{military}} tribunals used to <b>try</b> <b>these</b> suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law. It {{said that the president}} could not unilaterally establish such tribunals, and that Congress needed to authorize a means by which detainees could confront their accusers and challenge their detention.|$|E
2500|$|Gonzales' {{statement}} that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions [...] "substantially reduces {{the threat of}} domestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act" [...] suggests, at the least, an awareness by those involved in crafting policies in this area that U.S. officials are involved in acts {{that could be seen}} to be war crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court overruled the premise on which this argument is based in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, in which it ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applies to detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and that the Guantanamo military commission used to <b>try</b> <b>these</b> suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law because it was not created by Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1942 Quirin case, the U.S. {{signed and}} {{ratified}} the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which were thus {{considered to be}} a part of U.S. municipal law, in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Constitution of the United States (the Supremacy Clause). In addition the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated this premise, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, by ruling that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applies to detainees in the [...] "War on Terror", and that the Guantanamo military commission process used to <b>try</b> <b>these</b> suspects was in violation of U.S. and international law. In response to Hamdan, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act 2006, which President Bush signed into law on October 17, 2006. The Act's stated purpose was [...] "To authorize trial by military commission for violations of the law of war, and for other purposes." [...] The Act explicitly forbids the invocation of Geneva when executing the writ of habeas corpus or in other civil actions.|$|E

2500|$|Second of the {{original}} batch of locomotives delivered to the railway, No. 2 was named after the Earls of Derby who owned the Isle of Man before it was sold to the British monarch and is often seen in early photographs without her back cab sheet (No. 1 also appears in this form on a famous photograph of opening day. [...] No 2 Set the precedent for Steam On The Electric being used in construction by the Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Co. (there are two photographs illustrating this). No. 2 is the only locomotive on the railway to have been lost to the pages of history, only a pony truck survives today, {{and it is difficult}} to surmise if this was originally No. 2's as so many parts were interchanged on the locomotives. [...] She was withdrawn in 1951 and dismantled at the time for use as spare parts for the other smaller class locomotives. [...] The Frames having survived in store for many years were scrapped in 1980 by [...] "Pat the Rat" [...] (a local scrapman) at the behest of the then manager Bill Jackson. The surviving pony truck was for many years at the end of Birkenhead Siding at Port Erin with No. 4 <b>Try</b> <b>These</b> chalked on it, and is currently in store as a final reminder of the only engine to not exist in one form or another.|$|E

6000|$|The first {{question}} of importance that {{came before the}} Commission was the mode of trial to be adopted {{in the cases of}} those persons accused of acts contrary to the usages of civilised warfare, such as murder.

[...] It is satisfactory to know that the Commissioners gave this somewhat obvious fact [...] "their grave consideration," [...] which, according to their Report, resulted in their determining to let the cases go before the ordinary court, and be tried by a jury, because in referring them to a specially constituted court which would have done equal justice without fear or favour, [...] "the British Government would have made for itself, among the Dutch population of South Africa, a name for vindictive oppression, which no generosity in other affairs could efface." ...|$|E
