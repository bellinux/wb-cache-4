50|$|The South Wales Railway {{agreed to}} alter the {{intersection}} so as to separate the levels of the two lines, and to build a <b>transhipment</b> <b>shed</b> there to reload goods from narrow gauge to broad gauge wagons. These works were completed in 1857.|$|E
50|$|The Llanelly Railway and Dock {{company had}} a Llanelly station near its own dock, but the {{importance}} of connection to the emerging main line network was obvious, and the LR&D opened a short branch line to a terminus alongside the SWR Llanelly station. Nevertheless, because of the gauge difference, through running was not possible, and a <b>transhipment</b> <b>shed</b> was constructed for the transfer of goods there; these facilities opened in 1852.|$|E
50|$|In {{the main}} yard a <b>transhipment</b> <b>shed</b> existed {{for a number}} of years where small {{consignments}} were transferred between wagons; there was no public access to this facility, which closed in 1951. Local and regional freight trains serving local stations as well as the other goods facilities in the Ipswich area were re-marshalled in this yard. Regional destinations included Goodmayes and Temple Mills in London and Whitemoor (March) in Cambridgeshire.|$|E
50|$|Toddbrook Reservoir {{was built}} in 1831 as a feeder for the Peak Forest Canal. It is sited above the town of Whaley Bridge in the High Peak, Derbyshire. The {{reservoir}} is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It provides habitat for herons, ducks and other animals and fish. Also rare mosses and liverworts grow on its shores, particularly short-lived species that grow on seasonally exposed mud. The reservoir is also used for sailing and angling. It hosts many sailing events including DYS (Derbyshire Youth Sailing). The reservoir {{is owned by the}} Canal & River Trust and, like Combs Reservoir, is a feeder reservoir for Peak Forest Canal. The feeder runs though Whaley Bridge, and (along with the Combs feed) enters the canal system in a pool close to the <b>transhipments</b> <b>shed</b> at the Whaley Bridge Canal Basin.|$|R
40|$|Land is {{regarded}} as an important location factor by business firms. Firms change location due to internal and external factors and these changes should be accommodated by spatial reservations, subsequent land development and finally building of offices, plants or <b>transhipment</b> <b>sheds.</b> Business use of land competes with other uses of land, such as housing, leisure or nature. Spatial planning tries to balance these demands. Its success depends on finding criteria to justify a certain balance between economic and ecological interests or between different economic interests. Land-use should be included into a discussion about environmental sustainability. Spatial optimization would come at the agenda of firms and governments more often than is the case now. Yet, there {{is the issue of}} economic dynamics, which could be reduced if not all demands for new land are accommodated, at least according to business. This paper introduces a research program into the linkages between regional-economic-and spatial planning. It discusses the main ideas of this research program. ...|$|R
50|$|Horsehay & Dawley {{platform}} {{sits on a}} north-south through line, beneath Bridge Road. 150 {{yards to}} the west, Spring Village platform {{is at the end}} of a short spur off the running line. In between the two station platforms are the sidings and yard used for storing the railway's stock. Beyond Spring Village platform is the former goods <b>transhipment</b> <b>shed,</b> built in 1860, which had originally permitted the transfer of goods from the W&SJR to the Coalbrookdale Company's narrow gauge plateway system. The building now serves as the railway's engine shed. At the north end of the line TSR's Lawley Village station is located south of the site of the original Lawley station. That site is now occupied by a commercial development.|$|E
5000|$|The {{motorway}} {{service station}} on the left marks the site of Cullompton railway station, and then the line passes the remains of [...] and [...] stations. At [...] the old Exe Valley Railway used to join from the right, and then the railway sweeps through {{the valley of the}} River Culm to where it joins the River Exe near Cowley Bridge Junction. Here the Tarka Line from Barnstaple joins on the right and the line then passes (on the same side) Riverside Yard and an old <b>transhipment</b> <b>shed.</b> Until 20 May 1892, when the then Great Western Railway lines were converted from the [...] broad gauge, the shed was used to transfer goods between broad gauge wagons and the [...] standard gauge wagons used by the London and South Western Railway to Yeovil and Barnstaple. Passing over the wide Red Cow level crossing, the line comes to Exeter St Davids railway station.|$|E
