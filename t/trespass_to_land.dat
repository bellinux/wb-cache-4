5|$|Trespass in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} broadly divided into three groups: {{trespass}} to the person, trespass to goods and <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
25|$|Property torts involve any {{intentional}} {{interference with}} the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognized include <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.|$|E
25|$|Intentional torts are any {{intentional}} {{acts that}} are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories, including tort(s) against the person, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. Property torts involve any intentional {{interference with the}} property rights of the claimant. Those commonly recognised include <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> trespass to chattels, and conversion.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} defences <b>to</b> <b>trespasses</b> against the person; the {{stranger}} {{are the right}} of parents to commit assault and battery against their children for [...] "chastisement" [...] under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, {{and the right of}} the captain of a ship to discipline his crew, as in Hook v Cunard Steamship Co Ltd. There is also a right <b>to</b> eject a <b>trespasser</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> using reasonable force, and a defendant is also not liable for [...] "inevitable accidents", as in Stanley v Powell, where a ricocheting pellet was ruled to be accidental. Individuals and bodies will not be liable for imprisonment, battery or assault if doing so in line with statutory authorities, such as the Criminal Law Act 1967.|$|R
50|$|British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique 1893 AC 602 - the House of Lords {{overturned}} a Court of Appeal {{decision and}} {{by so doing}} established the Mozambique rule, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign <b>land,</b> the right <b>to</b> possession of foreign <b>land,</b> and <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> foreign <b>land</b> non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique 1893 AC 602 (Fry {{sitting in}} the Court of Appeal) - the House of Lords {{overturned}} Frys Court of Appeal decision and by so doing established the Mozambique rule, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign <b>land,</b> the right <b>to</b> possession of foreign <b>land,</b> and <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> foreign <b>land</b> non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions.|$|R
25|$|<b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> is {{any direct}} {{interference}} with {{land in the}} possession of another and is actionable per se. Examples of trespass are unauthorised entry to land, placing things on land and inducing animals to enter. Also, continuing trespass, which is actionable from day to day, occurs when there is continuation of presence after permission is withdrawn. The position taken with regards to the elements of trespass is similar in the UK and India.|$|E
500|$|In English law, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> {{involves}} the [...] "unjustifiable interference with land {{which is in}} the immediate and exclusive possession of another". It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable per se. While most trespasses to land are intentional, in League Against Cruel Sports v Scott, the courts decided that it could also be committed negligently. Accidental trespass also incurs liability, with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident), as in River Wear Commissioners v Adamson. Although previously a pure tort, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> can also be a crime.|$|E
500|$|<b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> {{involves}} the [...] "unjustifiable interference with land {{which is in}} the immediate and exclusive possession of another"; it is both a tort and, in certain circumstances, a crime under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable per se. While most trespasses to land are intentional, the courts have decided that it could also be committed negligently. Accidental trespass also incurs liability.|$|E
50|$|The {{trespasser}} {{need not}} enter the land in person. Indeed, if A and B are standing next <b>to</b> C's <b>land,</b> and A pushes B onto the land without entering it himself, it is A (and not B, who {{did not intend to}} enter that space) who is liable for the <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> C's <b>land.</b> There must be some physical entry, however. Causing noise, light, odors, or smoke <b>to</b> enter the <b>land</b> of another is not a trespass, but is instead a different tort, nuisance.|$|R
50|$|The Moçambique rule, or (to {{adopt an}} anglicised form of spelling) Mozambique rule, {{is a common}} law rule in private {{international}} law. The rule renders actions relating to title in foreign <b>land,</b> the right <b>to</b> possession of foreign <b>land,</b> and <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> foreign <b>land</b> non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions. It was established in 1893 by the House of Lords decision in British South Africa Co v. Companhia de Moçambique 1893 AC 602.|$|R
50|$|British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique 1893 AC 602 (Esher {{sitting in}} the Court of Appeal) - Esher dissented from the Court of Appeal {{decision}} of Fry LJ and Lopes LJ; the House of Lords overturned their decision and by so doing established the Mozambique rule, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign <b>land,</b> the right <b>to</b> possession of foreign <b>land,</b> and <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> foreign <b>land</b> non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|Necessity is {{typically}} a defense to <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> There {{are two kinds}} of necessity, private and public.|$|E
50|$|This is {{typically}} a defense to <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> or trespass to chattels, {{as it can}} refer to realty or personalty.|$|E
50|$|This element {{typically}} {{refers to}} damage, although damage {{is not required}} to prevail on certain intentional torts, such as <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1873, the Judicature Act {{abolished}} r 28 of the Rules of the Court. This {{meant that}} {{there was no need for}} a local venue to be laid. However, this change raised some issues. In particular, R H Collins argued that the legislative change might remove the disability of the English courts in relation to local actions, especially where the parties were domiciled in England. In the Court of Appeal in the Mozambique case, a majority (Fry and Lopes LJJ, Lord Esher dissenting) took a similar view of the effect of that Act. Fry LJ considered that the issue of jurisdiction in actions relating <b>to</b> <b>land</b> outside England could be resolved in two parts: Firstly, if the matter were requiring adjudication as to title, the court could not take jurisdiction, since it would have no power to ensure the execution of its order. Secondly, if the issue related to no more than <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> foreign <b>land,</b> and judgment might be given by way of an award of damages against the defendant, the only bar to the exercise by the English court of jurisdiction was the technical one that the action was a local one for which a local venue was required to be laid. Therefore, Fry LJ concluded that due to the abolition of local venues by the Act, there was nothing to prevent the court from taking jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|As {{a matter}} of {{political}} expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. For example, the fire services and other civil defence organizations have a general duty to keep the community safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a fire break, or <b>to</b> <b>trespass</b> on <b>land</b> <b>to</b> throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they {{believe it to be}} urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, parents who lack the financial means to feed their children cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. Further, some states apply a test of proportionality. So the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of cost-benefit analysis.|$|R

50|$|Trespass in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} broadly divided into three groups: {{trespass}} to the person, trespass to goods and <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
50|$|A person commits <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> when he wrongfully and {{intentionally}} enters, or {{causes a}} thing or third person to enter, land owned or occupied by another.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattels, {{also known}} as <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> goods or <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> {{personal}} property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property … proximately causing injury". <b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattel {{does not require a}} showing of damages. Simply the [...] "intermeddling with or use of … the personal property" [...] of another gives cause of action for trespass. Since CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, various courts have applied the principles of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattel to resolve cases involving unsolicited bulk e-mail and unauthorized server usage.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattels, {{also known}} as <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> goods or <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> {{personal}} property, is defined as [...] "an intentional interference with the possession of personal property...proximately causing injury". While originally a remedy for the asportation of personal property, the tort grew to incorporate any interference with the personal property of another. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattels has been codified to clearly define {{the scope of the}} remedy; in most jurisdictions, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattel remains a purely common law remedy, the scope of which varies by jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{action on}} the case for negligence, the rapid {{expansion}} of which is traced to Donoghue v Stevenson 1932. The tort of negligence {{lies at the heart of}} the modern law of tort, which also includes obligations enforced via the old actions of <b>trespass</b> (<b>to</b> the person, to goods, and <b>to</b> <b>land),</b> actions on the case, conversion, deceit, and defamation.|$|R
50|$|Property torts involve any {{intentional}} {{interference with}} the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognized include <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.|$|E
50|$|The tort of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> {{requires}} an intentional physical {{invasion of the}} plaintiff's real property by the defendant or a refusal to leave when ordered to leave.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> is {{a common}} law tort or crime that is {{committed}} when an individual or the object of an individual intentionally (or, in Australia, negligently) enters the land of another without a lawful excuse. <b>Trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> is actionable per se. Thus, the party whose land is entered upon may sue even if no actual harm is done. In some jurisdictions, this rule may also apply to entry upon public land having restricted access. A court may order payment of damages or an injunction to remedy the tort.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of trespass, {{the first of which}} is <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person. Whether intent is a {{necessary}} element of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person varies by jurisdiction. Under English decision, Letang v Cooper, intent is required <b>to</b> sustain a <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person cause of action; in the absence of intent, negligence is the appropriate tort. In other jurisdictions, gross negligence is sufficient <b>to</b> sustain a <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person, such as when a defendant negligently operates an automobile and strikes the plaintiff with great force. [...] "Intent is to be presumed from the act itself." [...] Generally, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person consists of three torts: assault, battery, and false imprisonment.|$|R

5|$|The general {{principle}} {{is that a}} <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person must be a direct and intentional act, while if it was indirect or unintentional the tort of negligence is more appropriate, as established in Letang v Cooper. The tort of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person contains three possible types; assault, battery and false imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|There may be {{regulations}} that hold a trespasser {{to a higher}} duty of care, such as strict liability for timber trespass (removing trees beyond a permitted boundary), which {{is a type of}} trespass to chattels {{as a result of a}} <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{court case}} lasted 20 years, and was {{complicated}} {{by the death of}} one of the defendants. It involved a matter in which the defendant had committed a <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> of his neighbor by tunneling under the plaintiffs' land and mining coal from it.|$|E
5000|$|In English law, <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> {{involves}} the [...] "unjustifiable interference with land {{which is in}} the immediate and exclusive possession of another". It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable per se. While most trespasses to land are intentional, in League Against Cruel Sports v Scott, the courts decided that it could also be committed negligently. Accidental trespass also incurs liability, with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident), as in River Wear Commissioners v Adamson. Although previously a pure tort, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> can also be a crime.|$|E
2500|$|In sum, {{the basic}} {{elements}} of a claim of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff's consent <b>to</b> the <b>trespass,</b> 2) interference or intermeddling with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant's actions. [...] Actual damage is not necessarily a required element of a <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> chattels claim.|$|R

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> goods; while <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> the person requires intent, the requirements for <b>trespass</b> <b>to</b> goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|R
