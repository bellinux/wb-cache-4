5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post <b>traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post <b>traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E

5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting <b>traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post <b>traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes.

5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early <b>traumatic</b> <b>stress</b> response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{repetitive}} micro <b>traumatic</b> <b>stresses</b> {{placed on}} the athletes shoulder joint complex during the throwing motion challenge the surrounding tissues. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare shoulder rotational strength, range of motion and proprioception between the throwing athletes and non-athletic persons. Methods: Fifteen throwing athletes and 15 non-athletes participated in a nonrandom case – control study. Strength of shoulder rotational movements was tested with a hand held dynamometer. The ranges of internal and external rotation of shoulder were measured by a standard goniometer. The ability of subjects to replicate the target position and kinesthetic sense was examined on the subjects’ right shoulder by using a continuous passive motion device. Independent and paired t tests were used to statistically analyze between and within group differences. Results: No significant difference was detected on the range of internal rotation between throwing athletes and non-athletic candidates (P= 0. 3). The range of external rotation was significantly more in athletic subjects (P= 0. 03). The results also showed that throwing athletes demonstrated a significantly higher isometric strength of shoulder external and internal rotation than the non-athletic group (P< 0. 05). However, the comparison of the internal and external rotation strength of dominant side in each group showed that throwing athletes showed a significant lower isometric strength of shoulder external rotation than internal rotation (P< 0. 001). It was also demonstrated higher joint position acuity in the throwing athletes than non athlete subjects (P= 0. 01). Conclusion: The repetitive nature of overhead throwing and the high forces that it causes result in adaptive changes of the dominant extremity. Throwing can lead to mobility, strength and neural adaptation...|$|R

40|$|M. A. In social work, {{the focus}} is on the care for others, but the issue of {{self-care}} is neglected. There is no internship requirements for students to learn about selfcare and the consequences that a lack of self-care behaviours will have on them personally and professionally. This research study had the dual purpose of teaching social work honours students Autogenic Training (AT) as a practical method of self-care and to measure and evaluate the personal and professional value of AT for them. Autogenic training is a deep relaxation technique with an autonomic and cognitive focus, and formed the basis of the self-care programme that was presented in 10 weekly sessions. An availability sample was used, and a combined quantitativequalitative approach adopted, by using a pre-test post-test group design. A validated self-report instrument was used to measure the impact on somatic, behavioural and cognitive anxiety symptoms, while a phenomenological enquiry was used to evaluate the personal meanings and experiences of the students as a result of engaging with this programme. The high drop-out rate reflected poorly on the overall results of the self-report instrument, however, the programme proved to be a successful psychosocial intervention, as it impacted positively on the students’ physical and emotional awareness, the awareness of the impact of their past and current <b>traumatic</b> <b>stresses</b> on their physical, mental and emotional functioning, and an awareness of self-care needs. They also learned and mastered an effective stress management skill, and participation in the group was valued by the students for the emotional support it provided to help them cope with their current stresses more effectively. An experiential self-care programme could be a beneficial component of the curriculum. Future research should involve such studies as part of the curriculum to allow sufficiently sized samples and prevent the high drop-out rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and extent of}} traumatic lesions were prospectively evaluated with MR imaging in 40 patients with closed head injuries. Primary intraaxlal lesions were classified according to their distinctive topographical distribution within the brain and were of four main types: (1) diffuse axonal injury (48. 2 %), (2) cortical contusion (43. 7 %), (3) subcortical gray-matter injury (4. 5 %), and (4) primary brainstem Injury (3. 6 %). Diffuse axonal injury most commonly involved the white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes, the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, and the corona radlata. Cortical contusions most frequently involved the Inferior, lateral, and anterior aspects of the frontal and temporal lobes. Primary brainstem lesions were most commonly seen in the dorsolateral aspects of the rostral brainstem. The pattern and distribution of primary lesions seen by MR were compared with those expected from previous pathologic studies and found to be quite similar. Our data and {{review of the literature}} would also indicate that MR detects a more complete spectrum of traumatic lesions than does CT. Secondary forms of injury (territorial arterial infarction, pressure necrosis from Increased intracranial pressure, cerebral hemiation, secondary brainstem injury) were also visible by MR in some cases. The level of consciousness was most Impaired in patients with primary brainstem injury, followed by those with widespread diffuse axonal injury and subcortical gray-matter injury. The best MR Imaging planes, pulse sequences, and imaging strategies for evaluating and classifying traumatic lesions were evaluated, and the mechanisms by which <b>traumatic</b> <b>stresses</b> result in injury were reviewed. MR was found to be superior to CT and to be very effective in the detection of traumatic head lesions and some secondary forms of injury.
