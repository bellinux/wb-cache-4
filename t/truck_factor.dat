40|$|Truck {{traffic is}} one of the major inputs to any {{pavement}} design procedure. In almost all pavement design procedures, truck traffic is represented in terms of the accumulated Equivalent Axle Load (EAL) applications. The level of EAL applications is mainly dependent on the prevailing values of truck factors. Thus efforts have to be made to accurately estimate <b>truck</b> <b>factor</b> values based on local loading conditions. The current practice of the Ministry of Communications (MOC) involves recording axle weights of loaded trucks only without including empty trucks. This, in turn, leads to higher <b>truck</b> <b>factor</b> estimates and consequently over-designed pavement structures. The main objective of this study is to quantify the effect of excluding empty trucks when estimating truck factors, on highway pavement design. The truck factors associated with loaded trucks were determined from MOC data files. The empty truck factors were determined from a field sample consisting of 4000 empty trucks. The empty-adjusted truck factors were calculated as the weighted average of the two <b>truck</b> <b>factor</b> values. An analysis has been conducted to study the effects of using the empty-adjusted truck factors on pavement design instead of loaded truck factors, using the AASHTO design procedure. The analysis indicated that the average <b>truck</b> <b>factor</b> for empty trucks is about 1. 15, the average <b>truck</b> <b>factor</b> for loaded trucks is about 9. 87 and the average empty-adjusted <b>truck</b> <b>factor</b> is about 6. 63.

40|$|Traffic {{on a road}} {{pavement}} {{is characterized by a}} large number of different vehicle types, and these can be considered in pavement design by using <b>truck</b> <b>factors</b> to transform the damage they apply to the pavement to the damage that would be applied by a standard axle. The definition of the <b>truck</b> <b>factors</b> to convert <b>trucks</b> into standard axles or load equivalent factors to convert axles into standard axles is carried out by considering the average loads for each axle. This process includes the vehicles that travel with axle loads above the maximum legal limit. There are also a substantial number of overloaded vehicles in terms of total vehicle weight. These axles/vehicles cause significant damage to the pavements that increases the pavement construction and rehabilitation cost. Thus, this paper investigates the impact of overloaded vehicles on {{road pavement}}s by studying the <b>truck</b> <b>factors</b> for different vehicle cases applied to a set of pavements composed by 5 different asphalt layer thickness and 5 different subgrade stiffness moduli.

These vehicles are considered in the pavement design by converting their effects through the use of <b>truck</b> <b>factors</b> which transform the damage they apply to the pavement to the damage that would be applied by a standard axle. The definition of the <b>truck</b> <b>factors</b> to convert <b>trucks</b> into standard axles or load equivalent factors to convert axles into standard axles is carried out by considering the maximum legal loads for each axle or considering the loads measured in weigh-in-motion systems corresponding to the actual loads.

Weigh-in-motion data from two stations located between two major cities of Pakistan (Peshawar and Rawalpindi) on Grand Trunk Road (N- 5) were collected and analyzed. Analysis of variance and comparison of actual and designed <b>truck</b> <b>factor</b> were performed to identify the most damaging axle truck type. It was found that axle truck type 3 (single/tandem axle) is most damaging among all truck types.

The equivalency factors for front and rear axles of single unit trucks were developed using AASHO Road Test equation after considering the decrease in front axle load and the increase in rear axle load due to the axle load redistribution on upgrades. The axle loads on upgrades are function of position of center of gravity of the truck, wheel base, upgrade magnitude and truck weight. The <b>truck</b> equivalence <b>factors</b> are obtained by summing up the equivalency factors of front and the corresponding rear axles. For upgrade <b>truck</b> equivalence <b>factors</b> the new term H / B representing the ratio of the height of the center of gravity H to the base length of single unit truck is of great importance.

In this paper, the fatigue damage of an asphalt mixture under different axle groups and truck configurations was determined directly from the indirect tensile cyclic load test by using load pulses that are equivalent to the transverse response due to the passage of an entire axle group or truck. In addition, the fatigue damage was obtained for different pavement structures using the SAPSI-M computer program and compared with laboratory results. The pavement fatigue damage and the LEFs/TFs were calculated using three different methods: peak strains, peak-midway strains, and dissipated energy. The results reveal that, in general, the LEFs/TFs based on the peak-midway strain method agree reasonably well with those from the dissipated energy method.

Funding agencies have shown interest in providing financial assistance for this task. Road design engineers require reliable traffic data and design specifications for detailed design of provincial roads. One of the basic inputs required for the pavement design is the ESAL values for each vehicle category in each road. The most common method used for the estimation of ESAL values for trucks is the static axle load survey conducted by RDA for national roads. The axle load surveys are rarely done for provincial roads. Different approaches have been adopted for the estimation of <b>truck</b> <b>factors</b> for provincial roads. Lack of institutional arrangements, inadequacy of funds, lack of technical knowledge and equipment are the main reasons for the inability to carry out proper studies in this sector. Currently used axle load survey methods and their errors are being discussed under literature review. A simple but accurate methodology is required for the estimation of axle loads. The main objective is to find out > How to estimate the truck loads from visual observation > Then how this load is distributed among the axles A good vehicle classification system is highly desirable for provincial road network in order to find out ESAL values. The vehicle load can be estimated using first principles. The historical axle load survey data shall be used to derive a relationship for the distribution of vehicle load between axles. Then the results will be used for the estimation of ESAL for a sample road. The analysis of results will be done with probability approach. The results will also be checked and verified for accuracy and reliability. Actual axle load survey data will be used for this verification. A simple yet very effective method for the estimation of <b>truck</b> <b>factors</b> shall be introduced for the provincial roads. Most of the provincial road agencies can use this method to find out ESAL values for the entire road network with the available resources. Further recommendations will be made for further improvements on the methodology to improve the reliability of result. ii...|$|R

Each crash type is further sorted into mutually exclusive categories {{on the basis of the}} roadway element responsible for the crashes: midblock segment, signalized intersection, and access point. Genetic programming (GP) is adopted for predicting crash frequency. GP, which is primarily based on genetic algorithms, uses the concept of evolution to develop models through the processes of crossover and mutation. The GP modeling approach gives independence for model development without restrictions on distribution of data. The models developed were compared to the basic negative binomial models. Morning and afternoon peak periods are observed to have fewer occurrences of rear-end crashes at all roadway elements. Higher traffic volume results in an increased number of angle crashes.

40|$|<b>Truck</b> <b>Factor</b> (TF) is a metric {{proposed}} by the agile community {{as a tool to}} identify concentration of knowledge in software development environments. It states the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In other words, TF helps to measure how prepared is a project to deal with developer turnover. Despite its clear relevance, few studies explore this metric. Altogether there is no consensus about how to calculate it, and no supporting evidence backing estimates for systems in the wild. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus of 133 popular project in GitHub. We later survey developers as a means to assess the reliability of our results. Among others, we find that the majority of our target systems (65 %) have TF <= 2.

Operating costs for personal vehicles (autos, pickups, SUVs, vans) are developed primarily from consumer guides, with an overall fleet average cost based on vehicle sales. Operating costs for large commercial trucks are based on a review of a number of sources of <b>trucking</b> costs. <b>Factors</b> for adjusting the costs based on stop-start conditions, pavement roughness, and inflation are derived from various sources. The results are that in a “baseline ” case of highway driving on smooth pavement, with a fuel price of $ 1. 50 per gallon, and other costs in 2003 dollars, that personal vehicles average 17. 1 cents per mile to operate, and trucks average 43. 4 cents per mile, not counting costs associated with the driver or travel time. City driving conditions, involving frequent stops and starts, increase this cost by 3. 9 cents per mile for personal vehicles and 9. 5 cents for trucks. Extremely rough pavement increases the baseline cost by 2. 7 cents for personal vehicles and 5. 5 cents for trucks...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Construction {{logistics}} is {{an essential}} part of construction supply chain management (CSCM). However, limited attention has been paid to this issue in the New Zealand construction industry. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge about what hampers efficiency in transporting construction materials and plants to a construction site. The intention is to gain detailed understanding of the practice and obstacles in efficient construction logistics and thus identify interventions to improve logistics efficiency, especially using the numbers of vehicle movements to the construction site as an indicator. Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach was adopted with on-site observations and interviews. Observations were performed during constructions on-site from the start of construction to “hand-over” to the building owner. A selection of construction suppliers and subcontractors involved in the studied project were interviewed. Findings – Data analysis suggested that cost-related factors affecting the construction logistics, both monetary and non-monetary factors were not measured and largely ignored, especially the possible environmental and/or social impact occurred by the <b>truck</b> movement. <b>Factors</b> in the service-related sector were insufficiently managed in the observed site. The main contribution to inefficient construction logistics are related to understanding and implementing CSCM. It is noticed that there is inadequate awareness of CSCM and logistics efficiency largely due to lack of commitment from the management level and skills at the operational level. Originality/value – Significant intrinsic and extrinsic interventions necessary to enhance construction logistics were acknowledged from the data analysis. These include both qualitative and quantitative data. These intrinsic and extrinsic interventions, such as implementing appropriate logistics tools that suits individual site and introducing traffic management costs, offer plausible explanations regarding how to improve the efficiency in construction logistics through optimising transportation movements to the construction site...|$|R
40|$|Azure Dynamics {{provides}} {{electric vehicle}} powertrain technology to commercial truck fleets in North America and Europe. Azure Dynamics is a firm in distress and fighting for survival, having {{filed for bankruptcy}} protection in March 2012. An analysis of commercial <b>trucking</b> markets reviews <b>factors</b> driving vehicle electrification and provides a market segmentation to find segments best suited to Azure’s technology. Porter’s Five Forces methodology is used to assess target market attractiveness and to identify key success factors. An internal analysis of Azure employs a value chain and a VRIO model to identify core competencies. A strategic fit matches firm capabilities to the Differentiation Focus generic strategy. A performance assessment maps Azure’s competitive position within light-duty and medium-duty truck market segments. Strategic options emerge from this analysis and are evaluated using a Balanced Scorecard. From the analysis, the strategic option of selling Azure as a going concern is recommended. Ideally, the acquirer would be a firm with deep financial resources and a long-term vision. This option provides Azure with enough working capital to let it deal with product gross margin issues, and to eliminate use of equity financing to fund operating costs...|$|R
