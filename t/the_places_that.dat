5|$|C-SPAN {{offers a}} number of public {{services}} related to the network's public affairs programming. C-SPAN Classroom, a free membership service for teachers, began in July 1987 and offers help using C-SPAN resources for classes or research. The C-SPAN School Bus, introduced in November 1993, traveled around the U.S. educating the public about government and politics using C-SPAN resources, {{and served as a}} mobile television studio. The bus also recorded video footage of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> it visited. A second bus was introduced in 1996. The two original buses were retired in 2010, and the C-SPAN Digital Bus was inaugurated, introducing the public to C-SPAN's enhanced digital products. C-SPAN has also equipped six Local Content Vehicles (LCVs) to travel the country and record unique political and historical stories, with each vehicle containing production and web-based technologies to produce on-the-spot content.|$|E

This use of the tudung was {{uncommon}} prior to the 1979 Iranian revolution, and <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> had women in tudung tended to be rural areas. The usage of the tudung sharply increased after the 1970s, as religious conservatism among Malay people in both Malaysia and Singapore increased.|$|E

One day, he notices a woman who reminds him of Madeleine, despite her different appearance. Scottie follows her and she identifies herself as Judy Barton, from Salina, Kansas.|$|E

By November, prostitution activity in Israel has become less apparent.

However, campaigners say that police action has shifted the industry to private apartments and escort agencies, making the practice more difficult to detect.|$|E

The Cabal {{have been trying}} to break the encryption on the Vex Gate with only limited success, but they do control many of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> the Guardian needs to visit on Mars thanks to their Exclusion Zone, which nobody had ever penetrated. The player's Guardian becomes the first to penetrate the Exclusion Zone and heads to the Garden's Spire, which charges the Gate Lord's eye. They also travel to the Buried City, the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an AI that used to be linked to the Warmind of Mars, but is now controlled by Rasputin. With the Vex now present on Mars, the Guardian finds out what they are doing; they are returning to their home, the Black Garden.|$|E

500|$|The {{closure of}} the Desert Inn in 2000 and {{subsequent}} demolition was unpopular with many as it seemed to {{mark the end of}} old Las Vegas. Historian Michael Green stated: [...] "To a lot of people outside of Las Vegas, these two places (the Desert Inn and the Sands) really meant Las Vegas. These were <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> represent the images of Las Vegas, in a far greater way than the Dunes, the Aladdin, the Hacienda and the Landmark". Robert Maheu, Howard Hughes's publicist for many years, remarked that the [...] "Desert Inn was the gem of Las Vegas". The hotel remained popular with locals until the end, as the heavily tourism-driven modern Las Vegas emerged in the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|The Syrian {{geographer}} al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as [...] "so rich {{in trees}} {{it looks like}} a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land". He accounted to Gaza the cities and towns of Ascalon, Jaffa, Caesarea, Arsuf, Deir al-Balah, al-Arish (in north-central the Sinai), Bayt Jibrin, Karatiyya, Hebron and Jerusalem—all of which had their own sub-governors. Emir Baibars al-Ala'i ruled Mamlakat Ghazzah between 1307-1310, during the second reign of an-Nasir Muhammad until the latter was briefly overthrown by Baybars al-Jashnakir. Gaza was one of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> returned to the allegiance of the exiled sultan; in 1310, an-Nasir Muhammad defeated Sultan Baybars in Gaza, forcing the latter to surrender his throne to him. Baybars was imprisoned in the city.|$|E
500|$|While Rogers' book enjoyed {{financial}} success, it had {{a practical}} purpose—to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, {{he would not have}} had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> he explored, with special emphasis on [...] "such [...] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade". [...] He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay [...] "within the limits of the South Sea Company", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times has {{recommended}} Cornell Plantations {{as a place}} to visit several times, calling it [...] "a satisfying experience" [...] in 1965, one of the sights of Cornell in 1979, a destination along a bicycling tour in 1985, [...] "another free diversion" [...] in 1989, and [...] "one last outing before leaving [...] " [...] in 2002. [...] The Boston Globe recommended the Plantations in 2000 as a [...] "free to the public museum of living plants". [...] In 2007, The Ithaca Journal referred to it as [...] "one of the area's gems" [...] and three years later said it [...] "combines the best of walking with the eye appeal of well tended gardens". [...] The Buffalo News portrayed the Plantations in 2010 as one of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> made Cornell worth a vacation for non-students.|$|E

500|$|The {{gunshot wounds}} that Scully, and later Mulder, {{discover}} on Maurice and Lyda were created on a computer. Special effects editor Bill Millar was tasked with designing the [...] "bloodless bullet holes" [...] {{that were on}} Asner's head and Tomlin's stomach. To create this effect, Millar attached orange fluorescent cloth to <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> would become the bullet wounds. An ultraviolet light was then added to the set lighting so that the invisible reflected light would function as tracking data. The orange cloth was then excised during post-production and the computerized bullet wounds were inserted in their place. Millar admits that the technique was borrowed from the 1992 movie Death Becomes Her, although he sarcastically admitted that, [...] "we did it better and with less money." [...] Gillian Anderson was later critical of the fake blood used for the episode because the sheer quantity soon coagulated and formed a [...] "gummy mess." ...|$|E
