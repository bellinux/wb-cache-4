5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the opening of}} the three new stations 6,000 additional commuters used the northwest service. <b>The</b> <b>Cumberland</b> station became particularly attractive to suburban commuters from Des Plaines and Park Ridge; a study commissioned shortly after the station's opening found that only 12.4% of commuters parking in <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> and Rosemont stations were Chicagoans. The influx of suburban commuters to the new Blue Line stops led to a fall in ridership on the Chicago & Northwestern's Northwest Line, which traditionally served the northwest suburbs near the new stops.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Presbytery, also {{within the}} Kentucky Synod, faced a {{shortage}} of ministers and decided to license clergy candidates who were less educated than was typical and who could not subscribe completely to the Westminster Confession. In 1805, the synod suspended many of these ministers, even bringing heresy charges against a number of them, and by 1806 the synod had dissolved the presbytery. In 1810, ministers dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} synod formed <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Presbyterian Church (CPC). The CPC subscribed to a modified form of the Westminster Confession that rejected the Calvinist doctrines of double predestination and limited atonement.|$|E

5|$|The 1903 {{revision}} of the Westminster Confession eventually led {{a large number of}} congregations from the Arminian–leaning Cumberland Presbyterian Church to reunite with the PCUSA in 1906. While overwhelmingly approved, the reunion caused controversy within the PCUSA due to concerns over doctrinal compatibility and racial segregation in <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Presbyterian Church. Warfield was a strong critic of the merger on doctrinal grounds. Northern Presbyterians, such as Francis James Grimké and Herrick Johnson, objected to the creation of racially segregated presbyteries in the South, a concession demanded by <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Presbyterians as the price for reunion. Despite these objections, the merger was overwhelmingly approved.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is located}} on <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Plateau, atop Lookout Mountain. On the summit of Lookout Mountain, the waters of Daniel Creek and Bear Creek cut gorges through the rock, {{converging}} to form Sitton Gulch Creek. The flat-topped mountains of <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Plateau are {{significantly different from the}} narrow Armuchee ridges beyond nearby Chickamauga Valley to the east. From a geological standpoint, Lookout Mountain is transitional between the flat-lying sedimentary beds of central Tennessee, and the ridges and valley to the east, which display more intensive folding and faulting. Most of the canyon's rock formations consist of sandstone; shale layers below the sandstone are marked by pine trees.|$|E

5|$|Cumberland's dismal winning {{percentage}} {{and the inability}} to field a team led to their disbanding {{at the end of}} the season. After only playing eight first-grade matches and one trial match, Cumberland ceased to exist and passed into history. Seven of <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> players moved to neighbours Western Suburbs, although only Harry Bloomfield, A. Halling and S. Jarvis played first-grade rugby league again.|$|E
5|$|Fields opposed a plan {{to develop}} {{hydroelectric}} power generation capabilities on <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Falls. In order to prevent development, he accepted an offer from T.

5|$|Fort Donelson {{was named}} for Brig. Gen. Daniel S. Donelson, who {{selected}} its site and began construction in 1861. It was considerably more formidable than Fort Henry. Fort Donelson rose about 100 feet (30m) on approximately 100 acres of dry ground above <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> River, which allowed for plunging fire against attacking gunboats, an advantage Fort Henry did not enjoy. The river batteries included twelve guns: ten 32-pounder smoothbore cannons, two 9-pounder smoothbore cannons, a 8-inch howitzer, a 6.5-inch rifle (128-pounder), and a 10-inch Columbiad. There were three miles (5km) of trenches in a semicircle around the fort and {{the small town of}} Dover. The outer works were bounded by Hickman Creek to the west, Lick Creek to the east, and <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> River to the north. These trenches, located on a commanding ridge and fronted by a dense abatis of cut trees and limbs stuck into the ground and pointing outward, were backed up by artillery and manned by Buckner and his Bowling Green troops on the right (with his flank anchored on Hickman Creek), and Johnson/Pillow on the left (with his flank near <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> River). Facing the Confederates, from left to right, were Smith, Lew Wallace (who arrived on February 14), and McClernand. McClernand's right flank, which faced Pillow, had insufficient men to reach overflowing Lick Creek, so it was left unanchored. Through the center of the Confederate line ran the marshy Indian Creek, this point defended primarily by artillery overlooking it on each side.|$|E

5|$|In the Knoxville Campaign, Burnside {{advanced}} to Knoxville, Tennessee, first bypassing the Confederate-held Cumberland Gap and ultimately occupying Knoxville unopposed; he then sent troops back to <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> Gap.

5|$|Lincoln {{promoted}} Grant {{to major}} {{general in the}} regular army and assigned him command of the newly formed Division of the Mississippi on October 16, 1863, including the Armies of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Cumberland. After the Battle of Chickamauga, the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> retreated into Chattanooga, where they were trapped. When informed of the situation, Grant put Major General George H. Thomas {{in charge of the}} rescue. Taking command, Grant arrived in Chattanooga by horseback, with plans to resupply the city and break the siege. Lincoln also sent Major General Joseph Hooker and two divisions of the Army of the Potomac to assist. Union forces captured Brown's Ferry and opened a supply line to Bridgeport. On November 23, Grant organized three armies to attack at Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain. Two days later, Hooker's forces took Lookout Mountain. Grant ordered Thomas and the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland</b> to advance when Sherman's army failed to take Missionary Ridge from the northeast. The Army of <b>the</b> <b>Cumberland,</b> led by Major General Philip Sheridan and Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood, charged uphill and captured the Confederate entrenchments at the top, forcing the rebels into retreat. The decisive battle gave the Union control of Tennessee and opened Georgia, the Confederate heartland, to Union invasion.|$|E

In February 2008, Paducah's American Justice School of Law changed owners after failing to secure accreditation from the American Bar Association. It was renamed the Alben W.
