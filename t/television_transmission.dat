25|$|Mainstream <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> {{commenced}} in Sydney and Melbourne just in {{time for}} the Melbourne Olympic Games in November/December 1956. It was then phased in at other capital cities, and then into rural markets. Many forms of entertainment, particularly drama and variety, proved more suited to television than radio, so the actors and producers migrated there.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 1996 EchoStar {{introduced}} Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) {{using the}} EchoStar 1 satellite. EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 {{to increase the}} number of channels available on Dish Network to 170. These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150-200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used. This greatly reduced the popularity of TVRO systems. In the mid-1990s, channels began moving their broadcasts to digital <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> using the DigiCipher conditional access system.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s an outside {{broadcast}} {{was made from}} {{the very top of}} the tower, in which the first passage of a satellite across the London sky was watched and described. It continued to be used for BBC News broadcasts until 1969, and for the Open University until the early 1980s. The antenna mast still stands and is used for local terrestrial <b>television</b> <b>transmission,</b> local commercial radio and DAB broadcasts. The main London television transmitter is now at Crystal Palace in south London.|$|E
50|$|Digital <b>Television</b> <b>transmissions</b> have {{commenced}} in Mount Isa. New channels {{provided by}} the ABC and SBS can be received with a digital set top box or digital television.

25|$|James Lindenberg, {{owner of}} BEC, {{was the first}} to apply for a license to the Philippine Congress to {{establish}} a television station in 1949.

Then, they try to experiment the <b>Television</b> <b>transmission,</b> using the two mango trees and inside was the rabbit-ear antennas and middle is the cable splitter and through the television. Because of the strict import controls and the lack of raw materials needed to open a TV station in the Philippines during the mid-20th century, Lindenberg branched to radio broadcasting instead.|$|E
25|$|The program debuted on ABC-TV on January 22, 1955, but {{the first}} 14 {{national}} telecasts were staged at KOMU-TV in Columbia, Missouri because network <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> capability from Springfield was not available. Columbia had a microwave transmitter, however, for ABC coverage of University of Missouri football games. After AT installed a microwave link in Springfield to transmit to Kansas City (which could feed to the network via Chicago), and modifications {{were made to the}} Jewell (including extending the stage and adding a control room), the program returned to the theater with the first broadcast April 30. The show was sent to KYTV by a local microwave link from the station's remote van. Rehearsals for Saturday shows were held on Fridays, with run-throughs Saturday afternoons.|$|E
25|$|After the {{interval}} act is over, {{when all the}} points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce {{the results of their}} vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the <b>television</b> <b>transmission.</b> However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson {{standing in front of a}} backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the Eiffel Tower or an Italian presenter might be seen with the Colosseum in the background.|$|E

25|$|Construction of a {{television}} network started with a microwave radio relay in the super high frequency band. The backbone of the system was a two-way 960 telephone channel, a one-way television channel network and additional communications lines in a third channel in Southern Norway. These lines could be rerouted {{if one of the}} relay stations fell out. It was supplemented with a redundant 300 telephone channel network. The relay network largely used the same masts as were used for <b>television</b> <b>transmission,</b> which was why the Telegraphy Administration was chosen instead of NRK. The 1957 plan called for seventy to eighty percent of the population having television coverage within twelve years. This was budgeted to cost NOK70 million, consisting of 28 transmitters and 19 frequency converters. The FM network would be built in parallel, with 37 transmitters and 10 frequency converters.|$|E
25|$|The year saw several {{advances}} in technology and exploration. On June 27 the first public demonstration of color TV was held by H. E. Ives {{and his colleagues at}} Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York. The first images were a bouquet of roses and an American flag. A mechanical system was used to transmit 50-line color television images between New York and Washington. The BBC broadcast a <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> for the first time. By November, Vladimir Zworykin had taken out the first patent for color television. On November 29, Bernt Balchen, U.S. Admiral Richard Byrd, Captain Ashley McKinley, and Harold June, became the first to fly over the South Pole. Within the year, Britain, Australia and New Zealand began a joint Antarctic Research Expedition, and the German airship Graf Zeppelin began a round-the-world flight (ended August 29). This year Ernst Schwarz describes Bonobo (Pan paniscus) as a different species from common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), both closely related phylogenetically to human beings.|$|E
25|$|Discussions on {{providing}} a docking module for the Shuttle-Mir programme began in May 1993 and approval was granted on 1 November, with the draft plan {{being developed by}} December. The module consisted of what were essentially two Soyuz TM-16 type Soyuz orbital modules cut in half, with a cylindrical central portion mounted {{in the center of}} the two halves which incorporated docking apparatus (the other two halves were not used). An APAS-89 docking port was mounted on each end. Mounting points were also provided for two boxes (containing new solar arrays) and other external experiments, and the module was provided with its own thermal control, <b>television</b> <b>transmission,</b> and telemetry systems. Rather than being covered in a newly-manufactured white thermal blanket, the module was flown with an unusual orange blanket, which was selected from pre-existing stock for financial reasons. Development of the simplified module was given priority over the more complex Mir-2 type SO-1, and the flight model, the first to make use of NASA's new Space Station Processing Facility, was delivered to Kennedy Space Center on 7 June 1995 alongside the new solar arrays which were to be launched with it.|$|E
50|$|Analogue <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{have now}} ceased. BBC Two was closed on 13 June 2012 and the {{remaining}} three services on 27 June.|$|R
50|$|In December 2005, the European Union {{decided to}} cease all analog audio and analog video <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> by 2012 and switch all {{terrestrial}} television broadcasting to digital audio and digital video (all EU countries have agreed on using DVB-T). The Netherlands completed the transition in December 2006, and some EU member states decided {{to complete their}} switchover as early as 2008 (Sweden), and (Denmark) in 2009. While the UK began the switch in late 2007, it was not completed until 24 October 2012. Norway ceased all analogue <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> on December 1, 2009. Two member states (not specified in the announcement) have expressed concerns {{that they might not}} be able to proceed to the switchover by 2012 due to technical limitations; the rest of the EU member states had stopped analog <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> by the end 2012.|$|R

25|$|In 1952 {{he defended}} the title with success against Bobby Dykes, Gil Turner, and with Graham {{in a third}} {{encounter}} between the two. All those fights were won by decision in 15. He also had five non-title bouts, including three that {{were a part of}} an Argentinian tour. His third fight with Graham was his first world title defense in Havana and his fight with Dykes marked {{the first time that a}} black man and a white man had a boxing fight in then-segregated Miami, Florida. In 1953, Gavilan retained the title by a knockout in ten against Chuck Davey, by a decision in 15 against Carmen Basilio and by a decision in 15 against Bratton. He had seven non-title bouts, losing to Danny Womber, but beating Ralph Tiger Jones. In 1954 Gavilan went up in weight. After two more points wins, he challenged world Middleweight champion Bobo Olson for the world title, but lost a decision in 15. Then, he went down in weight, and lost his world Welterweight championship, by a decision in 15 to Johnny Saxton. That same year, he appeared on a Telemundo Puerto Rico poster that promoted that country's first <b>television</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite the}} pending switch to digital, analog {{television}} remains being transmitted in most countries. An {{exception is the}} United States that ended analog <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [...] ). These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (North American designed), and SECAM (French designed). (It {{is important to understand}} that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do not {{have anything to do with}} the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.) For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo FM.|$|E
500|$|<b>Television</b> <b>transmission</b> {{has been}} taking place from Crystal Palace {{since at least the}} 1930s and two TV {{transmitter}} towers— Crystal Palace Transmitter– [...] tall— and Croydon Transmitter– [...] tall— stand on the hill at Upper Norwood, making the district a landmark location visible from many parts of the London area. The towers may appear similar in height and design, but the Crystal Palace mast, constructed in 1956, stands on a slightly higher elevation. The current Croydon tower was built in 1962.|$|E
50|$|The digital {{broadcasting}} network will be operational by 31 December 2012, allowing Gibraltar {{to meet its}} international obligation to cease its analogue <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> by that date.|$|R
