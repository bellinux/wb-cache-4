40|$|Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) {{has been}} {{proposed}} for optical fibre networks to a achieve high-speed connectivity, asynchronous operation and network control simplifications. Traditionally, all-optical devices have been proposed to encode, decode and process CDMA signals because the bandwidth in the optical medium is higher than electronic processing techniques. Today's advances in integrated circuit technologies coupled with bandwidth efficient circuit topologies, may provide robust alternatives for CDMA over fibre applications. This thesis overs two areas of work. First, a new circuit for encoding and decoding incoherent CDMA signals in the electrical domain is proposed. This structure makes use of the high bandwidth of distributed amplifier-like topologies to achieve very wideband operation. As proof of concept, a distributed transversal filter was designed with a commercial available GaAs MMIC process; modelling results show feasibility of CDMA encoding/decoding at 40 GChip/s employing transistors with cut-off frequencies of 60 GHz. Limitations and potential practical applications of these design ideas are discussed. The {{second part of the}} thesis focuses on the impact of the <b>time</b> <b>skewing</b> due to optical-fibre Group Velocity Difference in Wavelength-Hopping Time-Spreading (WHTS) Optical CDMA and the compensation of this impairment through electronic techniques. A new network model was created {{to assess the impact of}} such impairment in these systems.

The <b>time</b> <b>skews</b> {{give rise to}} a nonuniformly sampled signal instead of the desired uniformly sampled signal. This introduces the need for a digital signal reconstructor that takes the "nonuniform samples" and generates the "uniform samples". In the general case, the <b>time</b> <b>skews</b> are frequency dependent, in which case a generalization of nonuniform sampling applies. When the bandwidth of a digital reconstructor approaches the whole Nyquist band, the computational complexity may become prohibitive. This paper introduces a new scheme with reduced complexity. The idea stems from recent multirate-based efficient realizations of linear and time-invariant systems. However, a time-interleaved ADC (without correction) is a time-varying system which means that these multirate-based techniques cannot be used straightforwardly but need to be appropriately analyzed and extended for this context...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Partial {{differential}} equation solvers {{spend most of}} their computation time performing nearest neighbor (stencil) computations on grids that model spatial domains. Tiling is an effective performance optimization for improving the data locality and enabling course-grain parallelization for such computations. However, when the domains are periodic, tiling through time is not directly applicable due to wrap-around dependencies. It is possible to tile within the spatial domain, but tiling across time (i. e. <b>time</b> <b>skewing)</b> is not legal since no constant skewing can render all loops fully permutable. We introduce a technique called smashing that maps a periodic domain to computer memory without creating any wrap-around dependencies. For a periodic cylinder domain where <b>time</b> <b>skewing</b> improves performance, the performance of smashing is comparable to another method, circular skewing, which also handles the periodicity of a cylinder. Unlike circular skewing, smashing can remove wrap-around dependencies for an icosahedron model of earth’s atmosphere. ...|$|R

Providing over-the-horizon (OTH) telemetry {{data collection and}} displaying portions of this data in real time for range safety purposes {{are just a few}} of many factors required for successful instrumented range support. Techniques typically used for OTH telemetry data collection are to use fixed or portable antennas installed at strategic down-range locations, instrumented relay pods installed on chase aircraft, and instrumented high flying relay aircraft. Multiple data sources from these various locations typically arrive at a central site within a telemetry ground station and must be merged together to determine the best data source for real time and post processing purposes. Before multiple telemetered sources can be merged, the <b>time</b> <b>skews</b> caused by the relay of down-range land and airborne based sources must be taken into account. The <b>time</b> <b>skews</b> are fixed for land based sources, but vary with airborne sources. Various techniques have been used to remove the <b>time</b> <b>skews</b> associated with multiple telemetered sources. These techniques, which involve both hardware and software applications, have been effective, but are expensive and application and range dependent. This paper describes the use of a personal computer (PC) based workstation, configured with independent Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) decommutators/bit synchronizers, Inner-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) timing, and data merging resident software to perform the data merging task. Current technology now permits multiple PCM decommutators, each built as a separate virtual memory expansion (VME) card, to be installed within a PC based workstation. Each land based or airborne source is connected to a dedicated VME based PCM decommutator/bit synchronizer within the workstation. After the exercise has been completed, data merging software resident within the workstation is run which reads the digitized data from each of the disk files and aligns the data on a bit by bit basis to determine the optimum merged result.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} <b>time</b> <b>skewing</b> {{algorithm}} that breaks the memory wall for certain iterative stencil computations. A stencil computation, even with constant weights, {{is a completely}} memory-bound algorithm. For example, for a large 3 D domain of 500 3 doubles and 100 iterations on a quad-core Xeon X 5482 3. 2 GHz system, a hand-vectorized and parallelized naive 7 -point stencil implementation achieves only 1. 4 GFLOPS because the system memory bandwidth limits the performance. Although many efforts have been undertaken to improve the performance of such nested loops, for large data sets they still lag far behind synthetic benchmark performance. The state-of-art automatic locality optimizer PluTo [1] achieves 3. 7 GFLOPS for the above stencil, whereas a parallel benchmark executing the inner stencil computation directly on registers performs at 25. 1 GFLOPS. In comparison, our algorithm achieves 13. 0 GFLOPS (52 % of the stencil peak benchmark). We present results for 2 D and 3 D domains in double precision including problems with gigabyte large data sets. The results are compared against hand-optimized naive schemes, PluTo, the stencil peak benchmark and results from literature. For constant stencils of slope one we break the dependence on the low system bandwidth and achieve at least 50 % of the stencil peak, thus performing within a factor two of an ideal system with infinite bandwidth (the benchmark runs on registers without memory access). For large stencils and banded matrices the additional data transfers let {{the limitations of the}} system bandwidth come into play again, however, our algorithm still gains a large improvement over the other schemes.

40|$|Our goal is {{to deliver}} high {{performance}} portable implementations across mainstream multicore machines for an important application: tracking evolving surfaces. Level set is a widely used numerical algorithm for tracking evolving surfaces, which embeds the surface in a regularly discretized volume and performs numerical computation in the volume. The narrow band level set algorithm is {{a variation of the}} level set method that reduces the computational cost by tracking the evolution in a narrow band, which is a neighborhood region around the evolving surface. Computationally, it performs numerical stencil computation on the points in the narrow band, and tracks the motion of the narrow band in the meantime. The narrow band level set algorithm is featured by abundant data parallelism and temporal data reuse. However, code optimization for the algorithm is complicated by the irregularity of the dynamically evolving sparse band and the data dependant control flow inherent in the algorithm. We propose a novel code transformation for the narrow band level set algorithm, namely projective <b>time</b> <b>skewing.</b> This technique effectively extracts data reuse with low overhead. It is essentially different from applying the existing <b>time</b> <b>skewing</b> technique to the algorithm, and is much more efficient.
