5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E
5|$|The back of {{the fish}} is {{iridescent}} and blue-green in color, with many yellow and gold spots. The belly is white. The head color changes from a light blue to a pinkish mix during spawning season. Specimens have a tone of blue under their eyes. Their pectoral fins are a light tone of sepia, and <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin is a purplish-blue color.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy at <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empress Eudocia's {{copy of the}} Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic {{poet who}} tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E

5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is {{the formation of a}} slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of}} the shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E

5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu.

It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} extant manuscript, the Winchester Chronicle, {{was written}} by a single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, in <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next line; subsequent material {{was written by}} other scribes. This appears to place {{the composition of the}} chronicle at no later than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop Asser's use of a version of the Chronicle in his work Life of King Alfred, known to have been composed in 893. It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original Chronicle; as a result, there is no proof that the Chronicle was compiled at Winchester. It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of Alfred the Great (871–99), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of English as a written language. The Chronicle, as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.|$|E
