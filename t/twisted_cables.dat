50|$|The largest neck collar {{from the}} hoard {{consists}} of four <b>twisted</b> <b>cables</b> of silver, each a different size, hammer-welded together into flat terminals. The outermost cable consists of six thick, plaited rods and the inner three 'hollow' ropes each consists only of three coiled strands of double-twisted rods. Whilst the individual components of the collar can be paralleled, this 'West Viking' variant is unique. International trade associated with this hoard is best demonstrated by the 'Permian' style ring fragment, a type imported from Russia during {{the early part of}} the Viking period. Two complete six-plait cable neck-rings are also present in the hoard, as is a triple-strand neck-ring cut into half and used as hacksilver.|$|E

40|$|The crucial multi-physics {{problem of}} how to {{extrapolate}} from the performance of an isolated Nb 3 Sn strand measured in the laboratory to the performance of a superconducting coil using multi-strand <b>twisted</b> <b>cables</b> is addressed here. We consider the particular case of the path going from the LMI strand to the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) toroidal field model coil (TFMC), through its associated Full Size Joint Sample, the TFMC-FSJS. Mechanical, electromagnetic and thermal-hydraulic conditions are simulated using the ANSYS, ENSIC and Mithrandir/M&M codes, respectively. At least in this case, the DC performance of the short sample turns out to be relatively close to (considering error bars) but not fully representative of that of the coil, showing higher (less compressive) effective thermal strain but also higher sensitivity to the electromechanical load...|$|E

40|$|The cable in conduit {{conductor}} for the ITER coils {{is required}} to function under pulse conditions and fields up to 13 T. A parametric study, restricted to a limited variation of the reference cable lay out, is necessary to identify the quantitative impact of manufacturing parameters on the coupling loss {{and to find out}} more precisely the value of the coupling loss time constant {{to be used in the}} AC loss computation. Here we present the first results of the AC coupling loss measurements on jacketed sub size conductors with variations in type of cabling, cabling stage, twist pitch and void fraction. The AC loss is determined mainly by the calorimetric way but partly also using a magnetometer. A sinusoidal AC field amplitude of 15 - 400 mT, superposed on a DC background field of B/sub dc/= 0, 1 or 1. 5 T, is applied to determine the coupling loss time constants for different specimens. The results up to now show large coupling current time constants especially for braided cables, for which n. /spl tau/ can reach more than 1000 ms. For <b>twisted</b> <b>cables</b> with 81 strands n. /spl tau/ values up to 300 ms are attained...|$|E
40|$|The {{local cable}} network (cable plant) {{is a part}} of public {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN) which connects local telephone exchanges with customer’s premises equipment (CPE). It is built up of multipair <b>twisted</b> <b>cables.</b> Cable pairs are twisted to avoid mutual influence (crosstalks) among the pairs. Cable construction is developed for transmission of voice frequencies and it remains almost the same for some decades. This cable plant works well for telephone transmission even if all cable pairs are active. In the eightees ISDN technology appeared which transmitted signals up to 60 kHz and soon it became clear that only 70 % to 80 % of cable pairs met technical requirements for this technology. The main obstacle was mutual influence among pairs (crosstalks) which increases with frequency. Next came another transmission technologies as HDSL, ADSL, SHDSL, which were designed to connect PBX exchsnges to the PSTN and to deliver Internet to the customer’s home. All these technologies are called xDSL. Nowadays some new technologies appear, but the principles and line codes are the same (2 B 1 Q, PAM- 16, DMT). In general, transmission of signals with frequencies up to 1 MHz over local telephone lines is quite common now. Technologies up to 2 MHz or even 8 MHz (over short lines) are coming soon. Most widespread is the ADSL service, so it is important for operator company to make evaluation of practically achievable penetration of ADSL service over existing local cable plant [1]...|$|E
40|$|Sternum closure after open {{heart surgery}} is {{typically}} done with steel wires. Final approximation of sternal parts and connection {{is achieved by}} twisting {{the ends of the}} wire and bending the twisted assembly towards the sternum in order to minimize outward protrusion. Though this routine procedure is highly effective, some failures do occur, e. g. due to wire fracture. Fatigue fracture of the wires, e. g. due to coughing implies a failure risk. An alternative development is to make cables from gel spun Ultra High Molecular Weight Poly Ethylene (UHMWPE) fibres, such fibres are extremely strong, yet flexible, and if made as a very pure grade, they are highly bio compatible. The optimal connection technique will be different from that of steel. Connection will rather be with knotting than twisting. A new sternum closure and fixation technique has been developed for the sternum. Additionally, a testing technique was developed, for a connec-tion of simulated sternum parts, using different materials according to their respective optimal connection method and subsequently testing the mechanical properties of the connection. Substantial differences were observed. The mechani-cal behaviour of twisted steel wire connection showed more scatter than the knotted UHMWPE cables and some initial slack was sometimes present in the <b>twisted</b> <b>cables.</b> The maximum attainable force in the steel wires was determined by “untwisting ” due to the external load. The maximum force in the UHMWPE cables was determined by the knot strength...|$|E
