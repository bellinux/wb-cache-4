40|$|The {{macrolide}} antibiotic <b>tilmicosin</b> {{is known}} to induce cardiotoxic effect when administered at large doses. In this work, the effects of <b>tilmicosin</b> were evaluated with respect to alterations in total sialic acid, malondialdehyde and glutathione content of the heart, liver, kidney and lung tissues after single subcutaneous injection of 75 mg/kg <b>tilmicosin</b> with or without L-carnitine (500 mg/kg for 5 days daily via s. c. route) in BALB/c mice. L-carnitine is a co-factor serving in the mitochondrial β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, and it {{was reported to be}} protective in several types of toxicity cases probably via multi-factorial mechanisms. Twenty eight mice were divided into 4 groups including group 1 (control), group 2 (L-carnitine), group 3 (<b>tilmicosin)</b> and group 4 (<b>tilmicosin</b> plus L-carnitine). Following the administration of treatments, tissue samples were collected, and the samples were assayed for malondialdehyde, glutathione and total sialic acid content. Mice receiving <b>tilmicosin</b> treatment alone had significantly higher malondialdehyde and total sialic acid concentrations (except for MDA of lungs) but lower glutathione concentration in selected tissues compared to those of the control, group 2 (Carnitine only) and group 4 (L-carnitine plus <b>tilmicosin)</b> (p < 0. 05).

40|$|International audienceThe {{pathology}} {{of bacterial}} pneumonia, such {{as seen in}} the bovine lung infected with Mannheimia haemolytica, is due to pathogen virulence factors and to inflammation initiated by the host. <b>Tilmicosin</b> is a macrolide effective in treating bacterial pneumonia and recent findings suggest that this antibiotic may provide anti-inflammatory benefits by inducing polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte (PMN) apoptosis. Using an in vitro bovine system, we examined the cell-specificity of <b>tilmicosin,</b> characterized the changes in spontaneous leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) synthesis by PMN exposed to the macrolide, and assessed its effects on PMN Fas expression. Previous findings demonstrated that <b>tilmicosin</b> is able to induce PMN apoptosis. These results were confirmed in this study by the Annexin-V staining of externalized phosphatidylserine and the analysis with flow cytometry. The cell-specificity of <b>tilmicosin</b> was assessed by quantification of apoptosis in bovine PMN, mononuclear leukocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts cultured with the macrolide. The effect of <b>tilmicosin</b> on spontaneous LTB 4 production by PMN was evaluated via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, the mechanisms of tilmicosin-induced PMN apoptosis were examined by assessing the effects of <b>tilmicosin</b> on surface Fas expression on PMN. Tilmicosin-induced apoptosis was found to be at least partially cell-specific, as PMN were the only cell type tested to die via apoptosis in response to incubation with <b>tilmicosin.</b> PMN incubated with <b>tilmicosin</b> under conditions that induce apoptosis spontaneously produced less LTB 4, but did not exhibit altered Fas expression. In conclusion, tilmicosin-induced apoptosis is specific to PMN, inhibits spontaneous LTB 4 production, and occurs through a pathway independent of Fas upregulation...|$|E
40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{performed}} under commercial feedlot conditions in western Canada {{to compare the}} efficacy of florfenicol and <b>tilmicosin</b> {{for the treatment of}} undifferentiated fever (UF) in calves that received metaphylactic <b>tilmicosin</b> upon arrival at the feedlot. One thousand and eighty recently weaned, auction market derived, crossbred beef calves suffering from UF were allocated to one of 2 experimental groups as follows: florfenicol, which was intramuscular (i. m.) florfenicol administered at the rate of 20 mg/kg body weight (BW) at the time of allocation (Day 0) and again 48 h later, or <b>tilmicosin,</b> which was subcutaneous (s. c.) <b>tilmicosin</b> administered once at the rate of 10 mg/kg BW on day 0. Five hundred and forty-four animals were allocated to the florfenicol group and 536 animals were allocated to the <b>tilmicosin</b> group. The chronicity, wastage, overall mortality, and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) mortality rates were significantly (P or = 0. 05) differences in first UF relapse, second UF relapse, hemophilosis mortality, or miscellaneous mortality rates between the florfenicol and <b>tilmicosin</b> groups. Average daily gain (ADG) from arrival at the feedlot to the time of implanting and ADG from allocation to the time of implanting were significantly (P or = 0. 05) differences in arrival weight, allocation weight, implanting weight, or ADG from arrival to allocation between the experimental groups. In the economic analysis, there was an advantage of $ 18. 83 CDN per animal in the florfenicol group. The results {{of this study indicate that}} florfenicol is superior to <b>tilmicosin</b> for the treatment of UF because of lower chronicity, wastage, overall mortality, and BRD mortality rates.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of oral <b>tilmicosin</b> was compared with enrofloxacin, and {{the efficacy of}} three doses of the drug was examined in two fully randomized blinded field trials. Pneumonic milk-fed calves between 3 days and 2. 5 months of age were allocated into two groups in trial 1 (50 animals) and into three groups in trial 2 (69 calves). In the first trial, the animals were treated with 25 mg/kg/day <b>tilmicosin</b> or 2. 5 mg/kg/day enrofloxacin in milk for 5 days. In the second trial, the calves received either 25 mg/kg/day <b>tilmicosin</b> for 5 days or 3 days, or else 12. 5 mg/kg <b>tilmicosin</b> for 5 days. All calves were clinically examined for 10 days. In the first trial, oral, <b>tilmicosin</b> at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day for 5 days proved to be effective {{for the treatment of}} endemic pasteurellosis of milk-fed calves.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>tilmicosin</b> on the {{incidence}} of clinical mastitis and subsequent lamb performance was studied in 9 sheep flocks in Ontario. Ewes were treated randomly with either <b>tilmicosin</b> or placebo approximately one month prior to lambing. Outcome was assessed by comparing rates of clinical mastitis, palpable udder abnormalities, and preweaning (50 -day) lamb weights between the 2 treatment groups, while controlling for other important variables. Lambs raised by multiparous ewes treated with <b>tilmicosin</b> were significantly heavier than lambs from placebo-treated multiparous ewes at 50 days. Lambs from tilmicosin-treated ewes were on average 0. 52 kg heavier than lambs in the placebo group. There {{was no difference between}} treatment groups in the weight of lambs from first parity ewes. <b>Tilmicosin</b> treatment resulted in a 43 % decrease in palpable udder abnormalities. Incidence of clinical mastitis did not differ between experimental groups. The administration of <b>tilmicosin</b> prelambing, at the time of routine clostridial disease vaccination, may be a beneficial and convenient way to reduce mastitis infection and improve the preweaning gain of lambs...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of the}} macrolide antimicrobial <b>tilmicosin</b> in {{the horse}} was assessed by initially reviewing bacterial isolates from equine infections. This demonstrated that respiratory disease due to Gram positive organisms {{was the most common}} bacterial infection documented at WCVM. Furthermore, 45 % of Streptococcus zooepidemicus isolates were resistant to the commonly used potentiated sulphonamides. It was necessary to first develop and validate a robust HPLC analytical technique to detect <b>tilmicosin</b> in a variety of equine tissues. The methodology was fully validated in plasma and lung with LODs of 13 ng/mL and 181 ng/g respectively. In a preliminary trial, we administered <b>tilmicosin</b> to recently weaned foals at a dose of 4 mg/kg PO sid or 10 mg/kg SC q 72 hrs. The oral dose did not result in detectable tissue concentrations of <b>tilmicosin.</b> The pharmacokinetics of the injectable dose were similar to previous reports in other species. The injectable preparation resulted in severe swelling at the site of injection associated with edema and tissue necrosis. Otherwise, <b>tilmicosin</b> was well tolerated by the foals and no foals developed severe colitis. However, a semi-quantitative fecal bacteriological technique demonstrated marked changes in the normal fecal flora, with profound overgrowth of the Enterbacteriacae and almost complete removal of the normal â-hemolytic streptococci population. No known pathogens were isolated from the feces. In a subsequent study, we investigated the administration of higher doses of oral <b>tilmicosin</b> to unweaned foals to simulate treatment of R. equi. A dose of 40 mg/kg PO sid resulted in detectable plasma concentrations of <b>tilmicosin.</b> Foals were treated at this dose regimen for 2 weeks and sequentially euthanized. Tissue analysis demonstrated concentrations of <b>tilmicosin</b> in tissues similar to those seen with the 10 mg/kg sc dose with a Cmax of 4 µg/g in lung and a MRT which was shorter at 8. 8 hrs. The MIC 50 of R. equi to <b>tilmicosin</b> was 4 µg/g. Based on pharmacodynamic studies it appears that oral <b>tilmicosin</b> {{has the potential to be}} of use in the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in foals. No adverse clinical effects were noted in the foals; however, the fecal flora was again changed by <b>tilmicosin</b> administration. The fecal flora of the unweaned foals was different from that of the older animals with almost no â-haemolytic streptococci and a predominantly Gram negative flora. Disruption of the fecal flora did result in overgrowth of Cl. perfringens which was not associated with disease. In a final study, we compared the effects of <b>tilmicosin</b> and ceftiofur on the fecal flora of adult horses. The fecal flora of the horses receiving <b>tilmicosin</b> was severely disrupted in the same manner as the weaned foals with the added effect of overgrowth of Cl. perfringens. Ceftiofur which is widely regarded as being associated with antimicrobial associated diarrhea had very little effect on the fecal flora. It is concluded that oral <b>tilmicosin</b> shows potential for the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in young foals. However, care should be taken due to possibility of developing colitis. The drug’s use should be avoided in older horses due to the very real risk of developing acute bacterial colitis. The injectable preparation should not be used in horses due to the severity of the reaction at the injection site...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} randomized {{clinical trial}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the efficacy of <b>tilmicosin</b> (Pulmotil (R) premix) {{for the treatment of}} a clinical outbreak of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection in growing-finishing pigs. The effects of <b>tilmicosin</b> administration in the feed at 400 mg/kg and an injection therapy of clinically diseased pigs with long-acting oxytetracycline (Terramycine (R) LA) at 20 mg/kg body-weight were compared. Both groups, totalling 147 pigs, were compared during a medication period of 15 days and a post-medication period of 11 days by means of different clinical and performance parameters. During the medication period, the <b>tilmicosin</b> group showed a significant advantage with respect to the number of new disease cases (P 0. 05) with respect to the clinical parameters. During the overall study period (26 days), the average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio were both significantly (P < 0. 01) better in pigs from the <b>tilmicosin</b> group compared with pigs from the oxytetracycline group. This study demonstrated that in-feed medication of <b>tilmicosin</b> at a dosage of 400 mg/kg is efficacious for the treatment of a clinical respiratory disease outbreak of A. pleuropneumoniae infection in growing-finishing pigs.

40|$|We {{compared}} the field efficacy {{of a new}} antibiotic, florfenicol, with <b>tilmicosin</b> {{in the treatment of}} naturally occurring undifferentiated bovine respiratory disease. Beef calves with rectal temperatures greater than 40. 5 degrees C and signs compatible with undifferentiated bovine respiratory disease were entered into the trial. Calves were randomly assigned to receive either florfenicol (20 mg/kg bodyweight intramuscularly; 2 injections 48 h apart) or <b>tilmicosin</b> (10 mg/kg bodyweight subcutaneously; 1 injection). Clinical measures of efficacy included mortality, rectal temperature, illness index score, assessment of treatment success or failure, and the number of relapses or reinfections. Performance was assessed based on weight gains from day 0 to day 90. Two hundred and twenty calves entered the trial; 112 received florfenicol and 108 received <b>tilmicosin.</b> Seventeen deaths occurred between day 0 and day 90, but only 10 during the 28 -day trial period. Seven calves receiving <b>tilmicosin</b> died, compared with 3 receiving florfenicol (P = 0. 20). Of the 220 initial treatments, 45 (20 %) were categorized as treatment failures; 27 in the <b>tilmicosin</b> group and 18 in the florfenicol group (P = 0. 10). The number of calves experiencing a 2 nd relapse was significantly different, with 17 of 30 (57 %) calves on <b>tilmicosin</b> compared with 7 of 26 (27 %) calves on florfenicol relapsing at least twice (P = 0. 02). Average daily gains over 90 days were 1. 55 kg/day for florfenicol-treated calves and 1. 51 kg/day for tilmicosin-treated calves. No significant adverse reactions were noticed with either drug.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoints for <b>tilmicosin</b> against Haemophilus parasuis, which is an important pathogen of respiratory tract infections. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 103 H. parasuis isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. The wild-type (WT) distribution and epidemiologic cutoff value (ECV) were evaluated by statistical analysis. The new bronchoaveolar lavage (BAL) was used to establish intrapulmonary pharmacokinetic (PK) model in swine. The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of <b>tilmicosin,</b> both in pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) and in plasma, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and WinNonlin software. The pharmacodynamic cutoff (COPD) was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation. Our results showed that 100 % of WT isolates were covered when the ECV was set at 16 μg/mL. The <b>tilmicosin</b> had concentration-dependent activity against H. parasuis. The PK data indicated that <b>tilmicosin</b> concentrations in PELF was rapidly increased to high levels at 4 hours and kept stable until 48 hours after drug administration, while the <b>tilmicosin</b> concentration in plasma reached maximum levels at 4 hours and continued to decrease during 4 - 72 hours. Using Monte Carlo simulation, COPD was defined as 1 μg/mL. Conclusively, the ECV and COPD of <b>tilmicosin</b> against H. parasuis were established for the first time based on the MIC distribution and PK-PD analysis in the target tissue, respectively. These values are of great importance for detection of tilmicosin-resistant H. parasuis and for effective treatment of clinical intrapulmonary infection caused by H. parasuis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possible antioxidant effect of ghrelin against tilmicosin-induced myocardial damage in rats. Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups: control (saline for 5 days), <b>tilmicosin</b> (single dose of 75 mg kg‾ 1, s. c.), ghrelin (10 ng/kg/day for 5 days, s. c.) and ghrelin plus <b>tilmicosin</b> group (pretreatment with ghrelin followed by <b>tilmicosin</b> treatment). The heart were excised for evaluating Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) activity. The results showed that <b>tilmicosin</b> treatment alone significantly (p< 0. 05) elevated the levels of MDA and lowered the activities of SOD, CAT and GPx when compared with the control group. Pretreatment with ghrelin ameliorated the SOD, CAT and GPx activities and inhibited the levels of MDA production in the heart tissue compared to tilmicosin-treated rats.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) gene was examined by in situ hybridization in lung tissues from calves experimentally infected with Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica and treated with <b>tilmicosin.</b> Interleukin- 8 mRNA expression was detected in alveolar areas, particularly along interlobular septa, in the lumen, and in the epithelial cells of some bronchioles. In lesional lung tissues from animals that had received <b>tilmicosin,</b> we found large areas with limited inflammation. There was no staining for IL- 8 mRNA in these areas. In contrast, in strongly inflamed areas, the same patterns and intensities of staining for IL- 8 mRNA were detected in tilmicosin- and sham-treated animals. We conclude that <b>tilmicosin</b> {{does not affect the}} {{expression of}} IL- 8 mRNA in tissue showing microscopic signs of inflammation. Together with previous reports, this supports the view that the pro-apoptotic properties of <b>tilmicosin</b> on neutrophils do not compromise the host defense mechanisms required to control the infection...|$|E

Primary PAMs were collected from four 4 -week-old PRRSV-free pigs. After separately plated onto four 24 -well plates, PAMs were treated separately by 4 commercial <b>tilmicosin</b> preparations of 2 concentrations each (0. 1 mg/ml and 0. 01 mg/ml). The treated PAMs were inoculated with 0. 05 MOI of 01 NP 1 strain and were stained with PRRSV specific antibody using immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) to evaluate the quantity of PRRSV infected cells after 12 hours post infection (HPI).

At 1 h following inoculation animals received either: 1) Sham treatment with sterile 0. 85 % saline SC (n = 12); or 2) a single injection of 10 mg <b>tilmicosin</b> per kg body weight (n = 12). Calves that were non-infected and tilmicosin-treated were also included for determining <b>tilmicosin</b> concentrations in serum and lung tissue at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h (n = 3 -per time). In the infected calves, response to therapy was monitored clinically. Serum samples were collected for determination of <b>tilmicosin</b> concentrations using HPLC. Any animal becoming seriously ill was humanely killed. Complete necropsy examinations were performed on all animals and included gross pathologic changes, bacteriologic analysis, histopathology, and determination of pulmonary concentrations of <b>tilmicosin.</b> <b>Tilmicosin</b> treated animals responded significantly better to therapy than saline-treated control calves. Clinical assessment of calves during the study indicated that tilmicosin-treated calves had significantly improved by T = 8 h compared to satine-treated animals (P < 0. 05). At necropsy tilmicosin-treated calves had significantly less severe gross and histological lesions (P < 0. 05) of the pulmonary tissue. Of the 12 saline-treated calves, 92 % (11 / 12) had Pasteurella haemolytica-A 1 in lung tissue, while of the tilmicosin-treated calves 0 % (0 / 12) cultured positive for P. haemolytica. Mean (+/- standard error) serum <b>tilmicosin</b> concentrations in infected calves peaked at 1 h post-injection (1. 10 +/- 0. 06 micrograms/mL) and rapidly decreased to 0. 20 +/- 0. 03 microgram/mL, well below the MIC of 0. 50 microgram/mL for P. haemolytica-A 1 (B 122), by 12 h. These serum concentrations were very similar to serum concentrations of <b>tilmicosin</b> in non-infected tilmicosin-treated calves.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of some antimicrobials containing tiamulin and <b>tilmicosin</b> (as active principles) against Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection both in-vitro and in-vivo. For in-vitro investigation, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of tiamulin and <b>tilmicosin</b> against MG organism was done. However, the in-vivo evaluation of tiamulin and <b>tilmicosin</b> against field MG infection was carried out on a commercial broiler chicken farm taken from MG infected farm and proved to have such infection through bacteriological and serological examination at day old. Once the birds suffered from respiratory signs at 22 days of age, this flock was divided into three separate houses. Chickens in house (1) were kept as MG-infected without treatment; chickens in the house (2) were treated with tiamulin in the drinking water (1 gram/ 1. 5 liter) for 3 successive days and the birds in house (3) were also treated with <b>tilmicosin</b> in the drinking water (0. 3 ml/liter) for 3 successive days. Just after appearance of the first clinical signs and mortalities, the clinical signs score was recorded, the birds were weighed and the serum samples were collected for serological examination. The clinical signs and the mortalities in each house were recorded daily {{during and after the}} treatment course till {{the end of the study}} (42 days of age). The body weight of the birds in each house was determined weekly till 6 weeks of age. Twenty birds from each house were sacrificed weekly for recording the air-sac lesion score and for re-isolation of MG. The air-sac lesion score and the re-isolation of MG were also detected from the dead birds. Serum samples were collected from sacrificed 20 birds just after appearance of clinical signs and from each house at the end of the work (42 days of age) for detecting the presence of antibodies for MG infection using serum plate agglutination test. The results of the in-vitro assessment revealed that the MIC of tiamulin and <b>tilmicosin</b> (μg/ml) was 0. 1 and 0. 05; respectively. In-vivo evaluation of tiamulin and <b>tilmicosin</b> denoted that there were significant (p< 0. 05) differences between MG-infected non-treated house and the treated houses, Tiamulin and <b>tilmicosin</b> succeeded in inducing significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in the mean clinical score, mortality rate, mean gross air-sac lesion score, re-isolation rate of MG and absence of MG antibodies in the treated houses than the infected control group.

Control of MG infection in broiler breeder chicken flocks by chemotherapy {{is the most}} practical way to minimize economical losses. <b>Tilmicosin</b> {{is one of the}} most important antimicrobial agent used for treatment and control of MG infection. This study was carried out on eight broiler breeder chicken flocks with a history of MG challenge {signs, post mortem, and serology [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ]}. <b>Tilmicosin</b> (Provitil powder ® 30 mg/kg body weight) was used to limit MG infection in these flocks, and was given to birds for 3 successive days every 5 weeks for 4 months. 136 serum samples were collected from these flocks (16 - 18 samples per flock) before starting <b>tilmicosin</b> treatment and the same number of serum samples were collected following each three treatment course at 5 weeks interval. Mycoplasma gallisepticum ELISA was performed on these samples for the purpose of detecting MG antibodies in these flocks and analyzing data subsequently. The first and second course of <b>tilmicosin</b> treatment did not have any significant effect on MG ELISA results (GMT) (P> 0. 05), while after the third course, GMT had dropped significantly (P< 0. 05) in all tested flocks compared to results gained prior starting treatment with <b>tilmicosin.</b> The overall sero-prevalence of MG in broiler breeder chicke...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>tilmicosin</b> administered in the feed to control Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections in pigs was evaluated through a multisite, multitrial study. For each of 6 trials, 48 pigs (stratified by weight and sex) {{were randomly assigned}} to 6 to 8 pens. Medicated feed containing <b>tilmicosin</b> (200 g/t) and unmedicated feed were randomly assigned at the pen level and were provided ad libitum from day − 7 to trial termination (day 14). Seeder pigs (inoculated intranasally with A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 and showing signs of clinical disease) were introduced to each pen on day 0. Rates of death, gross lesions, and culture of A. pleuropneumoniae at necropsy, clinical scores, average daily gain in weight, and average body temperature were compared between the medicated and unmedicated pigs. Compared with the unmedicated pigs, significantly fewer (P < 0. 05) pigs given <b>tilmicosin</b> had lesions typical of A. pleuropneumoniae or had A. pleuropneumoniae isolated from their tissues at necropsy. Together with a significant reduction (P < 0. 05) in the average percentage of pneumonic lung involvement (both visually and by weight), there were reductions in the numbers of pigs with moderate and severe pneumonic lung lesions and with A. pleuropneumoniae associated mortality. With <b>tilmicosin</b> treatment, the average daily weight gain, daily temperature, abdominal appearance, attitude, and respiration were also significantly better (P < 0. 05). The results of this study demonstrate the in vivo effectiveness of <b>tilmicosin</b> (200 g/t) in controlling pleuropneumonia among swine experimentally infected with A. pleuropneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} <b>tilmicosin</b> (TIM) metabolism, at 25, 50 or 100 microM, in {{cultures of}} primary hepatocytes from rabbits bred commercially {{for food and}} in liver microsomes prepared from both untreated and rifampicin (RIF) -treated rabbits. RIF is a well-known cytochrome P 4503 A (CYP 3 A) inducer in rabbits and most macrolides {{are known to be}} substrates of CYP 3 A. No peaks in addition to those of the cis and trans forms of TIM were observed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in extracts of microsomes from untreated rabbits. When TIM was incubated with induced microsomes, at least two peaks were found by HPLC and an additional peak, eluting at shorter retention time was isolated from hepatocytes incubated for 24 h with the macrolide. The structures of the metabolites were then estimated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in concentrated extracts from induced microsomes. Five metabolites were separated and putatively identified: cis and trans demethylated <b>tilmicosin,</b> <b>tilmicosin</b> N-oxide and cis and trans <b>tilmicosin</b> epoxide.

40|$|A broth microdilution {{method was}} used to {{determine}} the antimicrobial susceptibility of 20 Brachyspira intermedia isolates obtained from different layer flocks in Belgium and The Netherlands between 2008 and 2010. The antimicrobial agents used were tylosin, <b>tilmicosin,</b> tiamulin, valnemulin, doxycycline, and lincomycin. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution patterns of tylosin, <b>tilmicosin,</b> lincomycin, and doxycycline were bimodal, demonstrating acquired resistance against doxycycline in three strains, against the macrolides in two strains, and against lincomycin in one strain. The MICs of tiamulin and valnemulin showed a monomodal distribution, but with tailing toward the higher MIC values, possibly suggesting low-level acquired resistance in six isolates. Sequencing revealed a G 1058 C mutation in the 16 S rRNA gene in all doxycycline-resistant strains.

A second injection of danofloxacin was administered on day 2, only if predefined clinical criteria were met. Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella muftocida and Haemophilus somnus were isolated from pretreatment nasopharyngeal swabs taken on all the farms. After the treatment, there was a more rapid improvement in the clinical response of the 178 animals treated with danofloxacin by day 2 (P< 0 - 01) than in the 90 treated with <b>tilmicosin.</b> For both treatments, there were similar significant (P< 0 - 001) reductions in the mean rectal temperature and severity of clinical signs of abnormal respiration and depression, on days 4 and 10 compared with day 0; 78 - 1 per cent of the animals treated with danofloxacin and 78 - 5 per cent of those treated with <b>tilmicosin</b> completed the studies.

Birds were inoculated intratracheally and into the sinus with the MG R-P 10 strain. A limited dose titration of the antibiotic over the expected effective range was included, using six groups of 60 birds each: UI: uninfected untreated group; IUT: infected untreated group; IT 1 to IT 4 : four infected treated groups, which were administered 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg/liter of <b>tilmicosin.</b> The birds were given <b>tilmicosin</b> from 8 to 13 days of age and were inoculated at 10 days of age. The birds were observed for 11 days postchallenge before terminal postmortem examination was completed including, assessment of lesions and sampling for mycoplasma culture and serology.

40|$|Background: Our {{previous}} studies demonstrated that tilmicosin-loaded {{hydrogenated castor oil}} solid lipid nanoparticles (Til-HCO-SLN) are a promising formulation for enhanced pharmacological activity and therapeutic efficacy in veterinary use. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the acute toxicity of Til-HCO-SLN. Methods: Two nanoparticle doses {{were used for the}} study in ICR mice. The low dose (766 mg/kg. bw) with <b>tilmicosin</b> 7. 5 times of the clinic dosage and below the median lethal dose (LD 50) was subcutaneously administered twice on the first and 7 th day. The single high dose (5 g/kg. bw) was the practical upper limit in an acute toxicity study and was administered subcutaneously on the first day. Blank HCO-SLN, native <b>tilmicosin,</b> and saline solution were included as controls. After medication, animals were monitored over 14 days, and then necropsied. Signs of toxicity were evaluated via mortality, symptoms of treatment effect, gross and microscopic pathology, and hematologic and biochemical parameters. Results: After administration of native <b>tilmicosin,</b> all mice died within 2 h in the high dose group, in the low dose group 3 died after the first and 2 died after the second injections.

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{increasing}} concern over routine administration of long-acting antibiotics to all cows {{at the end of}} lactation, the practice is required to eliminate subclinical infections that are present at drying off. Alternatives to dry cow therapy (DCT) for preventing new infections from occurring in uninfected quarters in the dry period are increasingly common. However, until a cost-effective and reliable test becomes available to determine which cows and quarters are not infected at drying off, administering DCT to all quarters and all cows remains the recommended practice. The efficacy of a novel intramammary treatment containing <b>tilmicosin,</b> administered at drying off to eliminate mastitis pathogens other than Staphylococcus aureus, was compared to intramammary cloxacillin. Data from 406 infected quarters, representing 238 cows that either received intramammary <b>tilmicosin</b> or benzathine cloxacillin, were analysed. The study was conducted in Ontario, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island in Canada for a period of one year, beginning in July 1999. Results showed that 11 % of quarters had a major mastitis pathogen recovered prior to the dry period. The overall cure rate of mastitis pathogens following administration of DCT was 89. 2 %. The cure achieved with intramammary <b>tilmicosin</b> was 87. 2 %, whereas for cloxacillin it was 90. 9 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} the cure rate between the 2 treatments, either in overall cure, or cure of any specific pathogen. Results of the final logistic regression models to determine factors associated with the probability of infected quarters to cure during the dry period reemphasized the importance of dry period length, season of drying off, and general environmental exposure. It is concluded that intramammary <b>tilmicosin</b> is as efficacious as benzathine cloxacillin for eliminating existing infections caused by pathogens other than S. aureus during the dry period. No commercial preparation of intramammary <b>tilmicosin</b> is currently available. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} ofthis {{study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of intramammary <b>tilmicosin,</b> administered at drying-off, for eliminating Staphylococcus aureus infection, and to identify risk factors for S. aureus cure during the dry period. A total of 219 naturally infected cows, representing 308 quarters, were randomized to receive either one of two treatments at drying-off. Cows received either an intramammary infusion of 500 mg of benzathine cloxacillin, or a sterile solution containing 1, 500 mg of <b>tilmicosin.</b> All cows had quarter milk samples taken aseptically three times before dry-off, and at wk 1, 2, and 4 of the subsequent lactation. Overall, 62 % of cows and 67. 5 % of quarters infected with S. aureus cured during the dry period. The cure following administraton of <b>tilmicosin</b> was 67. 3 and 72. 5 % for cows and quarters, respectively. By comparison, the cure achieved with cloxacillin was 56. 9 and 62. 9 % of cows and quarters. Cows receiving <b>tilmicosin</b> were 2. 1 {{times more likely to}} cure. The cure rate for cows decreased as the linear score on the last DHI test increased, and as the amount of S. aureus being shed increased. Quarters that cultured positive multiple times before drying-off were less likely to cure. Staphylococcus aureus infections located in front quarters of the udder were 2 times more likely to cure than those in hind quarters. Results of this study demonstrate that intramammary <b>tilmicosin</b> at drying-off is efficacious in curing existing S. aureus during the dry period. Risk factors associated with the cure of S. aureus were identified.
