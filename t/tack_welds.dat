40|$|A small friction-stir-welding tool {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> of aluminum-alloy workpieces. It is necessary to tack-weld the workpieces in order to hold them together during friction stir welding because (1) in operation, a full-size friction-stir-welding tool exerts a large force that tends to separate the workpieces and (2) clamping the workpieces {{is not sufficient to}} resist this force.

40|$|During final {{preparations}} for {{start of the}} PDCF Inner Can (IC) qualification effort, welding was performed on an automated weld system known as the PICN. During the initial weld, using a pedigree canister and plug, a weld defect was observed. The defect resulted in {{a hole in the}} sidewall of the canister, and it was observed that the plug sidewall had not been consumed. This was a new type of failure not seen during development and production of legacy Bagless Transfer Cans (FB-Line/Hanford). Therefore, a team was assembled to determine the root cause and to determine if the process could be improved. After several brain storming sessions (MS and T, R and D Engineering, PDC Project), an evaluation matrix was established to direct this effort. The matrix identified numerous activities that could be taken and then prioritized those activities. This effort was limited by both time and resources (the number of canisters and plugs available for testing was limited). A discovery process was initiated to evaluate the Vendor's IC fabrication process relative to legacy processes. There were no significant findings, however, some information regarding forging/anneal processes could not be obtained. Evaluations were conducted to compare mechanical properties of the PDC canisters relative to the legacy canisters. Some differences were identified, but mechanical properties were determined to be consistent with legacy materials. A number of process changes were also evaluated. A heat treatment procedure was established that could reduce the magnetic characteristics to levels similar to the legacy materials. An in-situ arc annealing process was developed that resulted in improved weld characteristics for test articles. Also several <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> configurations were addressed, it was found that increasing the number of <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> (and changing the sequence) resulted in decreased can to plug gaps and a more stable weld for test articles. Incorporating all of the process improvements for the actual can welding process, however, did not result in an improved weld geometry. Several possibilities for the lack of positive response exist, some of which are that (1) an insufficient number of test articles were welded under prototypic conditions, (2) the process was not optimized so that significant improvements were observable over the 'noise', and (3) the in-situ arc anneal closed the gap down too much so the can was unable to exhaust pressure ahead of the weld. Several operational and mechanical improvements were identified. The weld clamps were changed to a design consistent with those used in the legacy operations. A helium puff operation was eliminated; it is believed that this operation was the cause of the original weld defect. Also, timing of plug mast movement was found to correspond with weld irregularities. The timing of the movement was changed to occur during weld head travel between tacks. In the end a three sequential tack weld process followed by a pulse weld at the same current and travel speed as was used for the legacy processes was suggested for use during the IC qualification effort. Relative to legacy welds, the PDC IC weld demonstrates greater fluctuation in the region of the weld located between <b>tack</b> <b>welds.</b> However, canister weld response (canister to canister) is consistent and with the aid of the optical mapping system (for targeting the cut position) is considered adequate. DR measurements and METs show the PDC IC welds to have sufficient ligament length to ensure adequate canister pressure/impact capacity and to ensure adequate stub function. The PDC welding process has not been optimized {{as a result of this}} effort. Differences remain between the legacy BTC welds and the PDC IC weld, but these differences are not sufficient to prevent resumption of the current PDC IC qualification effort. During the PDC IC qualification effort, a total of 17 cans will be welded and a variety of tests/inspections will be performed. The extensive data collected during that qualification effort should be of a sufficient population to determine if additional weld process optimization is necessary prior to production release...|$|E

The test cell assembles TEC components using a control algorithm that combines high accuracy sensor measurements with an iterative stepwise alignment process performed bya robot. This test cell has been physically implemented and used for verifying the developed methodology. The equipment used in the test cell is specified in the thesis. The test cell consists of two industrial robots, fixtures and a high accuracy laser sensor.

This control algorithm is implemented using the Python programming language; the implementation is described in detail. The test cell assembly operation is based on the alignment of certain points on the components such that the offset is within tolerances.

40|$|Abstract. Laser welding {{is known}} for its low heat input {{compared}} to arc welding methods. This could enable laser welding of sheet metals with lighter fastening solutions and less time-consuming tack welding alternatives. A feasibility study was carried out to study four different corner joint types for 2 mm thick cold-rolled steel sheet by using filler-free laser welding. The aim of the research was to get more experimental knowledge about the laser welding of corner joints. Also possible benefits concerning faster manufacturing times and smaller costs by developing fastening applications for small batch laser welding was to be studied in practice. The 170 mm long joints were welded without air gap or pressing. All corner joint types proved to be weldable with a continuous wave Yb:YAG diode-pumped disk laser. It was also found during the experiment that laser welding enables the use of light and inexpensive fasteners such as magnetic holders instead of traditional clamps and fixturing. With some joint types, the insufficient fastening power of magnetic fasteners against distortions was compensated by making a spot-like laser tack weld {{at the end of the}} weld before welding the actual seam. This showed that it is possible to make precise and small <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> with a laser and to use laser-tacking in sheet metal assembly...|$|E
40|$|The local, {{nonuniform}} {{heating and}} subsequent cooling during the welding processes causes complex thermal stress/strain fields to develop that finally leads to residual stresses, distortions, and their adverse consequences. Residual stresses are of prime {{concern to the}} industries producing weld-integrated structures around the globe because of their obvious potential to cause dimensional instability in welded structures, contribute to premature fracture/failure, along with the significant reduction in fatigue strength and in-service performance of the welded structures. Arc welding with single or multiple weld runs is an appropriate and cost effective joining method to produce high-strength structures in these industries. A multifield interaction in arc welding process makes it a complex manufacturing process. A number of geometric and process parameters are contributing to significant stress levels in arc-welded structures. In the present analysis, parametric studies are conducted {{for the effects of}} a critical geometric parameter, that is, tack weld on the corresponding residual stress fields in circumferentially welded thin-walled cylinders. <b>Tack</b> <b>welds</b> offer a considerable resistance to the shrinkage and the orientation, and size of tacks can alter altogether the stress patterns within the weldments.

40|$|Use of bolted {{flanged pipe}} joints {{is very common}} in petrochemical, nuclear and process industry. Welding of pipe to flange results in {{residual}} stress built up and distortions which provide negative effects on the structural integrity and sealing capability of the pipe flange joint. The effects include stress corrosion cracking, brittle fracture, reduced fatigue and creep strengths, poor sealing performance and reduced buckling strength etc. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the extent and distribution of residual stress built up and distortions in the welded pipe-flange joints. The effects of welding parameters, welding procedure, applied mechanical constraints on residual stress built-up and distortions are evaluated. Effort are made to suggest the preventive or corrective measures for the reduction of welding distortions and residual stresses to improve the performance and service life of welded pipe-flange joints. This thesis is organized in three phases. In the first phase, preliminary studies for implementation of numerical technique for welding simulation and selection of appropriate models are performed. In the second phase, welding residual stresses are investigated including their dependence on welding parameters and their mitigation technique. The third phase is associated with the welding deformations. In Chapter- 1, a general introduction of welding deformation and residual stresses and their effect in pipe-flange joints in presented. In Chapter- 2, a comprehensive literature review of experimental and finite element simulation of welding in general and its application in circumferential joint in particular is discussed. Chapter- 3, describes the general finite element formulation and its application technique for material modeling, heat source modeling, modeling of filler material and analysis procedure etc. Chapter- 4, presents a comparative study of two and three-dimensional FE models of the pipe-flange joint subjected to a welding process. The aim of this study was to select an appropriate FE model for forth coming parametric numerical studies with the objective to investigate residual stresses and deformations. In Chapter- 5, experimental validation procedure has been described and a few selective validations are also presented. The objective of this chapter is to establish the reader confidence over the accuracy of numerical results. Chapter- 6, describes the effect of welding (Current and speed) and geometrical (pipe diameter and thickness) parameters on residual stress profile. In Chapter- 7, an analytical study regarding mitigation of residual stresses using mechanical stress relieving is presented and the effects of internal pressure, external pressure and axial pull on the residual stresses are determined. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the most effective mode of mechanical stress relieving. In Chapter- 8, the issues related to welding procedure specifications are addressed.

40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld pin tool that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld forge force through the weld pin tool against the material during pin tool rotation. The high weld forge force is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld forge force is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld pin tool by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld forge force required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed. The study consisted of performing a fourteen-foot diameter aluminum alloy circumferential demonstration weld using typical fusion weld tooling. To accomplish the demonstration <b>weld,</b> <b>weld</b> and <b>tack</b> <b>weld</b> development were performed and fourteen-foot diameter rings were fabricated.

40|$|Joints {{intended}} for welding frequently show variations in geometry and position, {{for which it}} is unfortunately not possible to apply a single set of operating parameters to ensure constant quality. The cause of this difficulty lies in a number of factors, including inaccurate joint preparation and joint fit up, <b>tack</b> <b>welds,</b> as well as thermal distortion of the workpiece. In plasma arc keyhole welding of butt joints, deviations in the gap width may cause weld defects such as an incomplete weld bead, excessive penetration and burn through. Manual adjustment of welding parameters to compensate for variations in the gap width is very difficult, and unsatisfactory weld quality is often obtained. In this study a control system for plasma arc keyhole welding has been developed and used to study the effects of the real time control of welding parameters on gap tolerance during welding of austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 L. The welding tests demonstrated the beneficial effect of real time control on weld quality. Compared with welding using constant parameters, the maximum tolerable gap width with an acceptable weld quality was 47 % higher when using the real time controlled parameters for a plate thickness of 5 mm. In addition, burn through occurred with significantly larger gap widths when parameters were controlled in real time. Increased gap tolerance enables joints to be prepared and fit up less accurately, saving time and preparation costs for welding. In addition to the control system, a novel technique for back face monitoring is described in this study. The test results showed that the technique could be successfully applied for penetration monitoring when welding non magnetic materials. The results also imply {{that it is possible to}} measure the dimensions of the plasma efflux or weld root, and use this information in a feedback control system and, thus, maintain the required weld quality...|$|E
40|$|Within {{industrial}} construction, piping can constitute up to 50 % of {{the cost}} of a typical project. It has been shown that across the activities involved in pipe fabrication, pipe fitting has the highest impact on the critical path. The pipe fitter is responsible for interpreting the isometric drawing and then performing the <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> on piping components so that the assembly complies with the design. Three main problems in doing this task are identified as: (1) reading and interpreting the isometric drawing is challenging and error prone for spatially complicated assemblies, (2) in assemblies with tight allowable tolerance, a number of iterations will take place to fit the pipes with compliance to the design. These iterations (rework) will remain unrecorded in the production process, and (3) no continuous measurement tool exists to let the fitter check his/her work in progress against the design information and acceptance specifications. Addressing these problems could substantially improve pipe fitters’ productivity. The objective of this research is to develop a software package integrating a threefold solution to simplify complex tasks involved in pipe fabrication: (1) making design information easier to understand, {{with the use of a}} tablet, 3 D imaging device and an application software, (2) providing visual feedback on the correctness of fabrication between the design intent and the as-built state, and (3) providing frequent feedback on fabrication using a step-by-step assembly and control framework. The step-by-step framework will reduce the number of required iterations for the pipe fitter. A number of challenges were encountered in order to provide a framework to make real time, visual and frequent feedback. For frequent and visual feedback, a real time 3 D data acquisition tool with an acceptable level of accuracy should be adopted. This is due to the speed of fabrication in an industrial facility. The second challenge is to find the object of interest in real time, once a point cloud is acquired, and finally, once the object is found, to optimally remove points that are considered as clutter to improve the visual feedback for the pipe fitters. To address the requirement for a reliable and real time acquisition tool, Chapter 3 explores the capabilities and limitations of low cost range cameras. A commercially available 3 D imaging tool was utilized to measure its performance for real time point cloud acquisition. The device was used to inspect two pipe spools altered in size. The acquired point clouds were super-imposed on the BIM (Building Information Model) model of the pipe spools to measure the accuracy of the device. Chapter 4 adapts and examines a real time and automatic object finding algorithm to measure its performance with respect to construction challenges. Then, a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm was employed to classify points as being clutter or corresponding to the object of interest. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of the threshold value “K” in the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and optimizing its value for an improved visual feedback. As a result of the work described in this thesis, along with the work of two other master students and a co-op student, a software package was designed and developed. The software package takes advantage of the investigated real time point cloud acquisition device. While the object finding algorithm proved to be effective, a 3 -point matching algorithm was used, as it was more intuitive for the users and took less time. The KNN algorithm was utilized to remove clutter points to provide more accurate visual feedback more accurate to the workers...|$|E

Part 1 of this two-part series of papers presents {{the estimation of}} the self-manufacturing (direct production) costs for composite and steel structures.

The material costs of the structural steel, concrete, reinforcement, the shear connectors, electrodes, the anti-corrosion, fire protection and top coat painting, the formwork floor-slab panels and gas consumption are presented in detail. The power consumption costs comprise costs of sawing the steel sections, edge grinding, drilling, welding, stud welding and vibrating the concrete. The labour costs (times) presented define the costs of metal cutting, edge grinding, preparation, assembling and <b>tacking,</b> <b>welding,</b> welding of shear connectors, steel surface preparation and protection, drilling, cutting, placing and connecting the reinforcement, concreting, consolidating and curing the concrete.

The present study emphasizes the theoretical investigation of slip damping in layered and jointed welded cantilever structures using finite element approach. Application of finite element method in damping analysis is relatively recent, as such, some problems particularly slip damping analysis has not received enough attention. To validate the finite element model developed, experiments have been conducted {{on a number of}} mild steel specimens under different initial conditions of vibration. Finite element model developed affirms that the damping capacity of such structures is influenced by a number of vital parameters such as; pressure distribution, kinematic coefficient of friction and micro-slip at the interfaces, amplitude, frequency of vibration, length and thickness of the specimen. Finite element model developed can be utilized effectively in the design of machine tools, automobiles, aerodynamic and space structures, frames and machine members for enhancing their damping capacity.

40|$|Abstract- For {{the growing}} heavy {{industrial}} sectors {{the demand for}} compactors is increasing day by day. Therefore, the company must meet the demand through the available facilities so {{that the company has}} to sophisticate the manufacturing processes in the existing plant. Despite existing models in other company’s being manufactured in the plant there is a need and demand for different higher capacity models In this paper, an attempt has been made to Develop, Modify and Generate concepts to mount the sub-assemblies from the compactor components onto a Fixture to perform <b>Tack</b> <b>Welding</b> on the sub-assemblies. Techniques suggested in this paper help in saving Cycle time per Job and also help in reducing the Man hours, which might otherwise have been spent on manual Welding of all the Sub-Assemblies, by making the process Automatic. Analysis has been done to calculate the stress, strain & deformation and also theoretical calculations has been done. Comparison is done between the ansys results & theoretical results. The fixture design is carried out by using CATIA V 5 R 20 Modeling software and the components are analyzed by finite element method (FEM) using Ansys software...|$|R
40|$|Fusion welding is {{the most}} common and {{convenient}} method used for the fabrication of large, thin-plate welded structures. However, the resulting tendency to out-of-plane distortion exacts severe design and fabrication penalties in terms of poorer buckling performance, lack of fairness in external appearance, poor fit-up and frequent requirements for expensive rework. This study forms part of a long-term project that has the aim of modelling welding and related fabrication processes computationally with particular emphasis on the out-of-plane distortion outcomes. Throughout the present work the computational models have been cross-referenced to realistic experimental test cases. A repeated finding of the trials was that minor variations in fabrication procedures, were found to have significant effects on distortion. In particular, the pre-fabrication procedures, including spot and <b>tack</b> <b>welding,</b> {{have a significant effect on}} the initial out-of-plane distortion leading to differences in distortion of the post-welded structures. The support and clamping conditions during welding and cooling of welded thin-plate structures were also found to have a considerable influence on the final predicted out-of-plane distortion. The outcomes often result in different buckling instability behaviour. This paper concentrates on these aspects and draws on studies of buttwelding between plates of thicknesses 3 - 8 mm...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedure}} is as follows: (1) Firmly bar clamp the box together in all directions. When all directions have been secured, <b>tack</b> <b>weld</b> each outside seam {{of the box}} in 4 or 5 places along it's length. Remove clamps and proceed to weld all outside seams. Care should be taken that the maximum weld cross section does not exceed 1 / 16 -inch x 1 / 16 -inch. (2) To help stabilize the metal as it cools, we will install all slot plugs, (MC- 223665), and one side cover plate, (MD- 223637). Inside welds for this side plate will be made thru the opposite side flange. Weld cross sections should be held to a 1 / 16 -inch maximum depth and width. (3) Weld {{the inside of the}} end plates, (MD- 224535), using the weld relief as filler material. After the box has cooled, weld the top plate (ME- 2244533) to the side flange, (ME- 224536) and then to the bottom plate (ME- 223534). (4) Repeat this procedure for the opposite side. (5) Helium leak check the welds, inside and out, by plugging the slot pumpout holes and pumping on the pumpout line. Remember that the clearances are very tight in the space that is to be pumpted. Allow plenty of time for a good pumpdown and leak check. Leak detection should be on the most sensitive scale on a helium leak detector with a minimum sensitivity of 10 - 9 ATM CC/SEC.
