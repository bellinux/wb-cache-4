The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> obligation to attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
25|$|Suppose <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> edge {{colouring}} of {{a complete}} graph using 3 colours, red, green and blue. Suppose further that the edge colouring has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex v. Consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex v. This is called the red neighbourhood of v. The red neighbourhood of v cannot contain any red edges, since otherwise {{there would be a}} red triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that red edge and the vertex v. Thus, the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of v has edges coloured with only two colours, namely green and blue. Since R(3, 3) = 6, the red neighbourhood of v can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the green and blue neighbourhoods of v can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for v itself, is in one of the red, green or blue neighbourhoods of v, the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 vertices. Thus, we have R(3, 3, 3) ‚â§ 17.|$|E
25|$|Again {{there are}} {{technical}} {{issues relating to}} spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, {{the solution to the}} problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function Œ∏(x). We say that if the function Œ∏ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum pnbsp&=nbsp&h/Œª, which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by Œ∏ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field Œ∏ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of V and A.) The result is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.|$|E

500|$|Two days later, Reagan {{met with}} his advisors at the White House, where a new plan was introduced.

As each weapons {{delivery}} was made from Israel by air, the hostages held by Hezbollah would be released. Israel would continue to be reimbursed by the United States for the weapons. Though staunchly opposed by Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, the plan was authorized by Reagan, who stated that, [...] "We were not trading arms for hostages, nor were we negotiating with terrorists". In his notes of a meeting held in the White House on 7 December 1985, Weinberger wrote he told Reagan that this plan was illegal, writing: I argued strongly <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> embargo that makes arms sales to Iran illegal and President couldn't violate it and that 'washing' transactions thru Israel wouldn't make it legal.

2500|$|In Aupers and Houtman (2010) Bovbjerg {{identifies}} NLP as a New Age [...] "psycho-religion" [...] {{and uses}} NLP as a case-study {{to demonstrate the}} thesis that the New Age psycho-religions such as NLP are predicated on an instrinsically religious idea, namely concern with a transcendent [...] "other". In the world's monotheistic faiths, argues Bovbjerg, the purpose of religious practice is communion and fellowship with a [...] transcendent 'other', i.e. a God. [...] With the New Age psycho-religions, argues Bovbjerg, this orientation towards a transcendent 'other' persists but the other has become [...] "the other in our selves", the so-called unconscious: [...] "he individual's inner life becomes the intangible focus of religious practices and the subconscious becomes a constituent part of modern individuals' understanding of the Self." [...] Bovbjerg adds, [...] "ourses in personal development would make no sense without an unconscious that contains hidden resources and hidden knowledge of the self." [...] Thus psycho-religious practice revolves around ideas of the conscious and unconscious self and communicating with and accessing the hidden resources of the unconscious self‚Äîthe transcendent other. According to Bovbjerg the notion <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unconscious self underlies many NLP techniques either explicitly or implicitly.

2500|$|Though lyric poetry prevailed at Frederick's (and later Manfredi's) court, {{it is at}} {{this time}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{interesting}} exception in Rosa fresca aulentissima (transl: [...] "Fresh very perfumed rose"), widely known as Contrasto and attributed to Cielo d'Alcamo (also known as Ciullu di Vincenzullu), about which modern critics have much exercised themselves. This Contrasto is written in a Sicilian language close to that spoken in the city of Messina, with several influences from continental Italian variants. The subject is a humorous fight between two young lovers, a kind of poetry quite common in the Middle Ages (as contrasti or pastorelle). It is about a young suitor who sneaks into the garden of a young lady from a rich Sicilian family and secretly declares his love to her. He then tries to seduce the girl with his one-liners; she berates him for his [...] "ill" [...] intentions and keeps him at bay to protect her honor, but her prudeness proves eventually to be just a love game: she gives in completely to his bold advances. However, the language uses much of the courtly language of lyric poetry and the result is a parody of the Sicilian School's clich√©s. The Contrasto belongs to the time of the emperor Frederick II (it can be dated between 1230 and 1250, but probably closer to the latter), and is also important as a proof that there once existed a popular, independent of literary, poetry prior to Frederick's times. Now most critics agree that the Contrasto of Cielo d'Alcamo is probably a scholarly re-elaboration of some lost popular song. It is perhaps the closest to a kind of poetry that has perished or which was smothered by the Sicilian literature of Frederick's. Its distinguishing feature was its hilarity and down-to-earthedness as opposed to the abstract verse of the Sicilian School. But {{it has been argued that}} its style betrays a profound knowledge of Frederick's movement and some critics have hinted the man who penned it must have been acquainted with or even been part of, the court itself. Given the highly satiric and erotic vein Ciullo d'Alcamo may well be a fictitious name. [...] His Contrasto shows vigor and freshness in the expression of feelings: [...] Such [...] "low" [...] treatment of the love-theme shows that its subject-matter is certainly popular. This poem sounds real and spontaneous, marked as it is by the sensuality characteristic of the people of southern Italy.|$|E

Casting calls began on March 16, 1996 and concluded on March 23. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind (1939). Casting turnouts reached 10,000 in Los Angeles and 5,000 in Chicago, while turnouts reached 8,000 in San Antonio. Mussenden chose 10-year-old Becky Lee Meza of Harlingen to portray young Selena, her acting debut. [...] Mexican actress Salma Hayek was invited to test the role of Selena by Esparza. Hayek turned the role down; she said she felt it was [...] "too early" [...] to base a movie on Selena {{and that it would}} be emotional because Selena's death was still being covered on U.S. television. Abraham discovered an actress in Los Angeles and wanted her for the role as Selena, despite her inability to convince the casting crew. He later had a change of heart when American actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez had showed up for the audition. Lopez found the audition process an elaborated procedure and was asked to sing, dance, and act out the elopement scene in front of the casting crew and Abraham. Within three takes of the elopement scene, Lopez convinced the entire casting crew who believed her performance was [...] "among the strongest". Lopez had previously worked with Nava in My Family (1995). Screen testing was described as [...] "grueling" [...] and required [...] "nine minutes of singing and dancing and eight pages of script." [...] After the announcement that Lopez would portray Selena, news media and fans criticized Abraham for choosing Lopez, a New York City native born to Puerto Rican parents, was selected to play a Texan of Mexican descent. The Mexican media disapproved the film and were outraged that Lopez was chosen for the title role. Lopez received backlash from the media and fans because she was not a Mexican American. The Hispanic community began protesting for a recast. During pre-production, Lopez stated: [...] "I know a few people were protesting, but in Corpus [...] everyone has been really supportive". Nava admitted that the backlash was [...] "a little hurtful", and felt the protesters [...] "should be celebrating <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> all-Latino cast and that Lopez, one of our own, is becoming a star." [...] The announcement was described as the [...] "role of a lifetime."
