No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality." [...] Lovato later said: [...] "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> your own relationship with God, and I {{still have a lot}} of faith." ...|$|E

I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided <b>that?</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a couple of swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|E

"Oh, Richard," [...] I remonstrated, [...] "is it {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>have</b> seen him and heard him, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>have</b> lived under his roof and known him, and can yet breathe, even {{to me in}} this solitary place {{where there is no}} one to hear us, such unworthy suspicions?" ...|$|R

500|$|The {{violence}} of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical combat, but for participants to experience feeling {{in a society where}} they are otherwise numb. The fights tangibly represent a resistance to the impulse to be [...] "cocooned" [...] in society. Norton believed that the fighting between the men strips away the [...] "fear of pain" [...] and [...] "the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the interpretation of which is left to the audience. Fincher elaborated, [...] "I love this idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution." ...|$|E
500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a [...] "must-see" [...] event. Gray said, [...] "At this point, {{people who are going to}} see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell the idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E

There are resemblances of myself in there, although that's a matter of opinion. It's good to play someone like <b>that,</b> where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a laugh".|$|R

500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] and he liked {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick is a really good actor and really good to work with in <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two of you in a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E
500|$|Stanaway {{said that}} it felt quite [...] "surreal" [...] that he had won in Monaco {{and that it was}} the ideal place to secure his first victory in the series. He stated that the series was still new to him and it was a [...] "fantastic feeling" [...] that he {{achieved}} success in his third race weekend. He hoped that he would improve as the season progressed. His team's managing director David Kennedy stated that it was [...] "the best result <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> in your maiden GP2 season" [...] and praised Stanaway for demonstrating his speed and talent. Marciello said that his second-place result would serve to bring positive motivation for his team but that they needed reminding that the result came during the shorter sprint race and hoped that they would secure a podium finish in Austria's feature event. Sirotkin said that his sprint race went better than the previous day's longer feature event as he felt that he should have a secured a podium finish in that race. The driver stated that the first podium of his GP2 Series career in Monaco was [...] "a great feeling" [...] but stated he should have been battling for a podium position in the season's first two rounds.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though {{he might be a}} bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

It's one of the most enjoyable experiences <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have.</b> But the point is: You've got to move on ... I'm still a senator from the state of Arizona.

2500|$|On January 4, 2011, Billboard {{revealed}} two guest {{appearances on}} Fiasco's album Lasers. The guests confirmed were Trey Songz and British rapper Sway. In {{the interview with}} Billboard, Fiasco expressed his thoughts on music piracy and fighting track leaks on various blogs. Speaking about the problems with his record label, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I think I set the precedent for record labels — showed everyone <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> rappers that don't fit the format {{and still have a}} presence [...] You look at a person like me, or Kanye , and {{it was sort of a}} shock to the system.

2500|$|In a panel {{discussion}} at Yeshiva University on October 22, 2013, Adelson said that the United States must get tougher about Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program.

He went on to explain that, after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on Tehran, the U.S. should then say: if [...] "You [...] want to be peaceful, just reverse it all and we will guarantee <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> a nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, energy purposes." [...] Adelson's spokesman told reporters that Adelson [...] "was obviously not speaking literally" [...] about using an atomic bomb in the desert, and that he was [...] "using hyperbole to make a point that … actions speak louder than words".|$|E
