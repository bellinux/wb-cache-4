[...] He then apologized to Colbert, in a {{conversation}} via satellite, for inadvertently smashing him {{over the head with}} a beer bottle during the brawl, amid the confusion. [...] While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a recycling bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat. [...] To which Colbert replied, [...] "No, no, Jon—I shoved a recycling bin over your head and encouraged Conan <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> with a baseball bat," [...] and, as usual, left Stewart confused. [...] At the end of the segment, Stewart asked Colbert: [...] "Did we win that , by the way?" [...] Colbert's answer was, [...] "I think America won, Jon." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1935 season Yorkshire {{regained the}} County Championship, and Verity passed 200wickets {{for the first}} time in his career, taking 211 at an average of 14.36 to finish third in the {{national}} averages. He took five wickets in an innings 22times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1–0. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: [...] "Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn't know whether <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> for four or six!" [...] South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches. In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: [...] "Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the prime}} of his career, Johnson's fastball was {{sometimes}} clocked over , even as high as [...] with a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm). His signature pitch was a slider that broke down and away from left-handed hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low 90s along with tight late break; hitters often believe they were thrown a fastball until the ball breaks just before it crosses home plate. Right-handed hitters have swung through and missed sliders that nearly hit their back foot. [...] Johnson dubbed his slider [...] "Mr. Snappy". [...] In later years, his fastball declined to the [...] range and his slider clocked at around [...] Johnson also threw a split-finger fastball that behaved like a change-up and a sinker to induce ground-ball outs. In a June 27, 2012, appearance on The Dan Patrick Show, Adam Dunn (a left-handed batter) was asked who the best pitcher he faced was. [...] "Honestly, Randy Johnson when he was good. It's hopeless. It's like a hopeless feeling. The first time you face him you feel like he's going <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> right {{in the back of}} the neck when he throws it, like every pitch is going <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> {{in the back of the}} neck. And it ends up down and away for a strike and you just have to trust it's going to be a strike, and heaven forbid he doesn't lose one out there and heaven forbid, there goes your cheek." ...|$|E

5000|$|MLS fined {{head coach}} Hans Backe $2,500 for {{comments}} made following their 3-2 loss to New England at Gillette Stadium. Backe stated [...] "I would say it's an absolute disgrace. It's ridiculous, it's a joke" [...] and [...] "when the referee decides games like this, probably the MLS should do an investigation because it's {{not even close}} <b>to</b> <b>hitting.</b> <b>You</b> can see {{the level of the}} referee, the level went and down. It's a joke. If this had been in Italy there would be an investigation if the referee was bought." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to the recent Criterion Collection release, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk review, had the following to say about it: [...] "I wouldn't call Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain – Criterion Collection an anti-war film so much as I'd call it a realist's war film. Rather than build his story around big explosions and the thrill of battle, Ichikawa instead brings the human drama front and center, directing his spotlight on a soldier who is left to his own devices when the guns stop blazing. He poses the question, 'When stranded on the bombed-out landscape after the fighting has calmed, what will those left behind do to survive?' It's bleak and it's chilling, and yet Fires on the Plain is also completely engrossing. It's the post-action picture as morality play, the journey of the individual recast with Dante-esque overtones. Ichikawa doesn't have <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> {{over the head with}} a message because the story is so truthfully crafted, to state the message outright would be redundant. Once you've seen Fires on the Plain, the movie will get under your skin, and you'll find it impossible to forget." ...|$|E

[...] Wilson said; [...] "here {{is where}} it is; there is a cut all {{along the top of}} your head; the bullet seems <b>to</b> have <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> at the back, and gone right along over the top.

5000|$|Donahue was {{selected}} in the 11th round of the 1978 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. He played offensive guard for the Bengals in 1978 and 1979. [...] Donahue later recalled: [...] "It was fun playing {{a couple of years}} with the Bengals. It was a great experience lining up against legends like Randy White of the Dallas Cowboys and Joe Greene and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The first time you're in a stance against them, you're almost too excited <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> them. <b>You</b> get over that real quick when you realize there is no hesitancy at all on their part on <b>hitting</b> <b>you</b> hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--I don't {{know about}} that. I can {{generally}} 'it pretty 'ard if I feel inclined. But I don't want <b>to</b> <b>'it</b> <b>you.</b> As regards you I {{can tell the}} story one way,--or the other, just as you please." [...] Lopez, seeing {{it in the same}} light, at last agreed that the story should be told in a manner not inimical to himself. The present project of his life was to leave his troubles in England,--Sexty Parker being the worst of them,--and get away to Guatemala. In arranging this the good word of Mr. Slide might not benefit him, but his ill word might injure him. And then, let him do what he would, the matter must be made public. Should Mr. Wharton hear of it,--as of course he would,--it must be brazened out. He could not keep it from Mr. Wharton's ears by quarrelling with Quintus Slide.|$|R

500|$|Midtown Madness is {{distinct}} from other racing games of its time, especially those influenced by the Need for Speed series, in providing an open environment rather than a closed circuit. Project director Clinton Keith said that an open world makes the gameplay more diverse and adds [...] "element of discovery" [...] such as finding shortcuts. Gary Whitta described the game as open world racing: [...] "you still have checkpoints <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> [...] <b>you</b> don't have to follow the A-B-C-D standard to do it".|$|R
