5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> decreases as <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent of <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b> Therefore, the total time for a curve to shrink to a point is proportional to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Mokhtarian and Mackworth {{involves}} computing the curve-shortening flow, tracking the inflection points of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> as they {{progress through the}} flow, and drawing a graph that plots {{the positions of the}} inflection points around <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> against the time parameter. The inflection points will typically be removed from <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> in pairs as <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> becomes convex (according to the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem) and the lifetime of a pair of points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape.|$|E

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|An {{approximation}} to the curve-shortening flow can be computed numerically, by approximating <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> as a polygon {{and using}} the finite difference method to calculate the motion of each polygon vertex. Alternative methods include computing a convolution of polygon vertices and then resampling vertices on the resulting curve, or repeatedly applying a median filter to a digital image whose black and white pixels represent the {{inside and outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E

5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> collapses to a singularity.|$|E

In June1942 four men were brought by submarine and landed on Long Island, planning to destroy such sites as <b>the</b> <b>Curve,</b> Hell Gate Bridge, Alcoa aluminum factories and locks on the Ohio River.

5|$|Graphically {{bounding}} {{the production}} set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the {{maximum possible production}} level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology. By doing so, it defines productive efficiency {{in the context of}} that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> (such as X) indicates impossibility.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of finding an average of several curves subject to {{qualitative}} constraints. <b>The</b> average <b>curve</b> is <b>the</b> solution of a weighted least squares problem involving the deviation between <b>the</b> given <b>curves</b> and <b>the</b> unknown <b>curve.</b> <b>The</b> qualitative constraints are that some curves are preferred compared to other <b>curves.</b> <b>The</b> qualitative information is converted into constraints on the weights in the least squares problem defining <b>the</b> average <b>curve.</b> <b>The</b> model defining <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> is parameterized and restrictions on <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> are defined in terms of restrictions on the parameters.

Addition-ally, {{it is hard to}} approximate within a factor of 76 even when <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> are line segments with bounded slopes. Lastly, we demonstrate that the problem is W [2]-complete when <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> are convex polygonal x-monotone chains and is W [1]-hard when <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> are line segments. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up. For a smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compute the curve-shortening flow efficiently, both a {{continuous}} curve and the continuous evolution of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> {{need to be replaced}} by a discrete approximation.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E

40|$|Understanding what moves <b>the</b> Phillips <b>curve</b> is {{important}} to monetary policy. Because <b>the</b> Phillips <b>curve</b> has experienced over time movements similar to those characterizing <b>the</b> Beveridge <b>curve,</b> <b>the</b> authors jointly analyze the two phenomena. They do that through an agent-based macro model based on adaptive micro-foundations, which works fairly well in replicating a number of stylized facts, including <b>the</b> Beveridge <b>curve,</b> <b>the</b> Phillips <b>curve</b> and <b>the</b> Okun <b>curve.</b> By Monte Carlo experiments the authors explore the mechanisms behind the movements of <b>the</b> Beveridge <b>curve</b> and <b>the</b> Phillips <b>curve.</b> They discovered that shifts of <b>the</b> Beveridge <b>curve</b> are best explained by the intensity of worker reallocation. Reallocation also shifts <b>the</b> Phillips <b>curve</b> in <b>the</b> same direction, suggesting {{that it may be}} the reason behind the similarity of the patterns historically recorded for these two curves.

5|$|Similar {{results can}} be {{extended}} from closed curves to unbounded curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such curves, if both sides of <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> have infinite area, then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area, and <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side of <b>the</b> <b>curve,</b> with unbounded curvature near the singularity. For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E
