5|$|De Lucía {{lived for}} five years in Yucatan, Mexico, but {{returned}} to his native Spain in 2003 after professing to have become really tired with spending his whole life touring for six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> a year, getting up {{at the crack of}} dawn and living in hotels. He continued to keep a holiday home in Mexico though and regularly visited with his family.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that {{they would be able to}} cut back on overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms as a pretext to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> in Californian {{populations and}} four to twelve months in Alaska, {{with the mother}} {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months,</b> but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E

5|$|Stressing of {{the host}} tree and visible larval {{boreholes}} appear in the fourth stage. The infestation is reinforced by further insects or fungi, which in turn may cause more symptoms. Imago, fungus, and larvae together can cause tree death in a period ranging from two weeks <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{poliomyelitis}} result in only temporary paralysis. Nerve impulses {{return to the}} formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months.</b> The neurophysiological processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost. Paralysis remaining after one year {{is likely to be}} permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male stands over the female and forms a cage {{with his legs}} {{protecting}} her while she moults. Internal fertilisation takes place before the hardening of the new carapace, {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to lay her eggs. Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> until they hatch.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for seven <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months.</b> When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their {{equipment to the}} RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UNPROFOR, did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs. The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarisation of the UNPAs, ceasefire maintenance, monitoring of local police and creating conditions for return of internally displaced persons and refugees. Those comprised more than 300,000 Croats who were exiled from the RSK-controlled territory, and 20,000 Serbs who fled the areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) in Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91 and Hurricane-91 in late 1991.|$|E
5|$|During Willis's term, state revenue {{increased}} {{because of}} to wartime inflation, increased federal money, {{and the relative}} prosperity of the state's economy. The state budget was $31 million when Willis took office; {{by the time he}} left office, it had expanded to $52 million. Much of these funds were devoted to education. Expenditures per pupil nearly doubled, as did teacher salaries. The school year was lengthened from seven <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months.</b> Counties were also allowed to double their school tax rate. He created a Commission on Negro Affairs, appointed the first African-American to the state Board of Education, and increased state aid to pay out-of-state tuition to minorities who had been denied admission to professional programs in the state universities.|$|E
5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> of age, and rams generally at {{four to six}} (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing {{in concert with the}} rise in twinning (freemartins are the result of male-female twin combinations).|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Meerkat Manor {{was created}} by Caroline Hawkins, {{executive}} producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for Animal Planet International by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild. Filming for a 13-episode series took seven <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months,</b> and {{was limited to the}} Kalahari spring and summer seasons, as meerkats are less active during winter. Series three was filmed from November 2006 through April 2007, and Series four began filming in October 2007. Most scenes were filmed on location at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the Kalahari Meerkat Project that the meerkats are a part of is based. However, the meerkats seen in commercials and on the show's website were not the same animals portrayed in Meerkat Manor. Instead, tamer-rescued meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center were filmed against a green screen.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{the ecology}} of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent. It is an herbivorous species which lives in the fresh spray zone of the Chittenango Falls, in {{partially}} sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth. Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection, namely humidity, substrate, temperature, vegetation, and water quality. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species, and its mating season is from May through July. It lays egg clusters, each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs, at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. Maturity is reached in five <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months,</b> and its life span is roughly 2.5 years. Some of its predators include insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and occasionally other snails.|$|E

50|$|At {{the charity}} signing before the Grammy awards, {{the band was}} photographed {{together}} with former drummer Chris Slade. It was later confirmed that he had rejoined the band for the Grammys and upcoming tour. In April 2015, Rudd pleaded guilty to drug charges and threatening to kill a former assistant. Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade. On 9 July 2015 Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>month's</b> home detention.|$|R
5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E
5|$|After outrunning Duckworth on 26 December, Willaumez sailed for the South Atlantic, {{intending}} to {{pass into the}} Indian Ocean and cruise off the Cape of Good Hope {{in anticipation of the}} arrival of the British China Fleet. The China Fleet was a large annual convoy of East Indiamen that originated in Canton and passed through the Malacca Straits, across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope and then north through the Atlantic Ocean, arriving in British waters six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> after departure. During the passage, the convoy gathered ships from the various British colonies in the Indian Ocean and by the time it passed the southern tip of Africa it often contained dozens of vessels. By combining the heavy armaments of the East Indiamen with a strong Royal Navy escort, the China Fleet became a formidable target for French raiding squadrons: at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804, an unescorted China Fleet drove off a powerful French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois after a sharp encounter.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for up <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their {{equipment to the}} RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing of the Implementation Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as the pink zones, were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of this aspect of the implementation of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention for Croatia and the RSK.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} similar {{reproductive}} strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated {{by a single}} ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months</b> old, and rams generally at four to six months. However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and {{a small number of}} the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).|$|E
5|$|The JNA also {{evacuated}} its facilities {{elsewhere in}} Croatia. Pullout from the Maršal Tito and Kerestinec barracks in Zagreb started on 30 November, and {{was completed by}} the end of 1991. Istria was evacuated by the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy on 15 December, handing over the Croatian TO weapons to the HV. The quantity of the TO weapons handed over in Istriawhere the JNA evacuated 78 facilitieswas enough to arm two combat brigades. In December 1991, only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade, including a minor, unsuccessful HV attack on Mekušje barracks in Karlovac. Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment, the JNA remained for seven <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>months.</b> When its troops eventually withdrew from Croatia, the JNA left their equipment to the Republic of Serbian Krajina, established in the JNA-held areas of Croatia on 19 December. The JNA and the Yugoslav Navy kept their bases on Vis and Lastovo islands until early June 1992 before pulling out unilaterally. The JNA maintained positions near Dubrovnik until July, while the naval blockade of the city was lifted on 26 May 1992.|$|E
