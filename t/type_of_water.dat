25|$|Water vapor {{will only}} {{condense}} onto another surface when that surface is cooler than {{the dew point}} temperature, or when the water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded. When water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, {{the temperature of the}} atmosphere drops slightly. In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei). The dew point of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> or rain.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the Jin River {{was used}} for boat traffic {{in and out of}} Chengdu. However, due {{to the size of the}} river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of {{carrying}} any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou—both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways—on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.|$|E
25|$|After the EPA had {{introduced}} watershed-based NPDES permitting in 2007, interest in nutrient removal and achieving regional TMDLs {{led to the}} development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> quality trading, a market-based policy instrument used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program.|$|E
25|$|The primary mode of {{informing the}} quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and {{wetlands}} of the U.S. is through the National Water Quality Inventory Report. Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress {{as a means to}} inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes. The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act. The report is organized into two major sections; Section 1 shows national assessment of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> body, with causes and sources identified. Section 2 summarizes recommendations on improvement of water resource management.|$|E

25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the flavor}} {{characteristics}} of Grodziskie {{result from the}} chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer. [...] The water {{from one of the}} wells on Poznańska Street in Grodzisk was tested, and showed a sulfate ion concentration of 183 parts per million (ppm) and a chloride ion concentration of 81 ppm. [...] Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm. [...] Using this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions. [...] During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to fermentable sugars during mashing. [...] The result is a beer with more unfermented sugars and lower average alcohol content. [...] Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.|$|E

The data showed that the decay of pirimiphos-methyl after one week was (49. 9 %) in well water compared with that of distilled and SHW (29. 4 ad 44. 5 %). Decay of chlorpyrifos-ethyl in distilled water after one week was 11. 7 % then increased afterwards and reached 29. 5, 40. 8 and 99. 5 % of the amount determined at zero (initial deposit) after 14, 21 and 75 days. Same trend of chlorpyrifos-ethyl decay was observed in well and SHW. Pirimiphos-methyl was vastly degraded when compared with chlorpyrifos-ethyl in the three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The data also showed that the decay of cypermethrin was high after one week in the three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> where it exceeded 75 %.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} {{the role of}} ubiquitous (non-Escherichia coli) Enterobacteriaceae in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance through the urban water cycle. Enterobacteriaceae isolated from a {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} (111 isolates), urban water streams (33 isolates) and drinking water (123 isolates) were compared in terms of: (i) genera distribution, (ii) resistance to 12 antibiotics, and (iii) class 1 and class 2 integrons. The predominant bacterial genera were the same in the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> although with a distinct pattern of species.
