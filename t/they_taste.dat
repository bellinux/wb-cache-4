5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how <b>they</b> <b>taste</b> to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
25|$|The method {{generally}} produces wines {{that are}} highly aromatic with low alcohol content, sometimes as low as 6%. The wines are sometimes somewhat obscure from remaining lees. <b>They</b> <b>taste</b> best 1–3 years after bottling and do not develop with further storage. In general, the wines are slightly sweet but brut (dry) varieties are also produced. The method's main weakness is that the production process is difficult to control and therefore requires great skill by the winemaker. The produced volumes are very modest. High-quality wines produced with the ancestral method, often by small growers using organic farming principles, can be complex and very distinctive. They are mainly used as aperitifs or dessert wine with fruit dishes.|$|E

In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: [...] "As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind {{and that we should}} destroy towers in America in order that <b>they</b> <b>taste</b> some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{most popular}} sweets during Fat Thursday are pączki (Polish donuts) or faworki called also {{in some regions}} of Poland [...] "chrust". The {{traditional}} donuts are filled with rose petal jam (plum jam or apple) and covered with thin layer of icing or powdered sugar, sprinkled with orange peel. Fat Thursday used to {{mark the beginning of}} a Fat Week, the period of great gluttony during which Polish ancestors consumed dishes served with smalec (lard), bacon and all kinds of meat. Nowadays Fat Thursday is associated particularly with donuts, therefore on that day confectioneries are besieged by Poles who wish to purchase pączki to celebrate. Donuts baked in Poland are smaller in size than their North American counterparts and <b>they</b> <b>taste</b> more like apple fritters.|$|E
2500|$|The words [...] "draft" [...] and [...] "draught" [...] {{have been}} used as {{marketing}} terms to describe canned or bottled beers, implying that <b>they</b> <b>taste</b> and appear like beers from a cask or keg. Commercial brewers use this as a marketing tool although it is incorrect to call any beer not drawn from a cask or keg [...] "draught". Two examples are Miller Genuine Draft, a [...] pale lager which is produced using a cold filtering system, and Guinness stout in patented [...] "Draught-flow" [...] cans and bottles. Guinness is an example of beers that use a nitrogen widget to create a smooth beer with a very dense head. Guinness has recently replaced the widget system from their bottled [...] "draught" [...] beer with a coating of cellulose fibres {{on the inside of the}} bottle. Statements indicate a new development in bottling technology that enables the mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide to be present in the beer without using a widget, making it according to Guinness [...] "more drinkable" [...] from the bottle.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple critics {{recognized}} sex as {{the main}} theme of Bionic. Eric Handerson of Slant elaborated that the album [...] " [...] all in service of routine pop sex, the sort of standard-issue sleaze that [...] stood in stark contrast against." [...] Echoing Handerson's point of view, The Georgia Straights Mike Usinger commented, [...] "Where past Xtina efforts have hinted that's she's horny to the core, Bionic makes a concrete case that she's the dirtiest girl working in mainstream pop." [...] On [...] "Not Myself Tonight", Aguilera explicitly announces her new persona and style adopted on Bionic, declaring that [...] "The old me's gone I feel brand new / And if you don't like it, fuck you." [...] "Woohoo", a song about oral sex featuring Nicki Minaj, contains lyrics such as: [...] "All the boys think it's cake when <b>they</b> <b>taste</b> my woohoo / You don't even need a plate, just your face." [...] "Desnudate", which means [...] "get naked" [...] in English, is a bilingual Spanish and English track in which Aguilera calls herself the [...] "supplier of lust, love and fire." [...] The interlude [...] "Morning Dessert" [...] describes sex as a daily routine of Aguilera and her husband, while in [...] "Sex for Breakfast", Aguilera characterized her lover's penis as a [...] "honey drip." ...|$|E

This {{belief that}} the living may visit, on occasion, the {{dwellings}} of the dead, but can never return to earth if <b>they</b> <b>taste</b> the food of the departed, is expressed in myths of worldwide distribution. Because she ate the pomegranate seed, Persephone became subject to the spell of Hades. In Apuleius, Psyche, when she visits the place of souls, is advised to abstain from food. Kohl found the myth among the Ojibbeways, Mr. Codrington among the Solomon Islanders; it occurs in Samoa, in the Finnish Kalewala (where Wainamoinen, in Pohjola, refrains from touching meat or drink), and the belief has left its mark on the mediaeval ballad of Thomas of Ercildoune.
