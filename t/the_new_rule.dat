5|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> was not applied retroactively, {{therefore}} all American-bred horses registered before 1913 {{remained on}} the register, and their descendants were also eligible for registration. Of the 7,756mares in Volume 27 of the General Stud Book, published in 1933, 930 would have been ineligible under <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule.</b> The Jersey Act did have an immediate impact however, as {{the winner of the}} 1914 Epsom Derby, Durbar II, was ineligible for registration, as his dam, Armenia, was bred in the United States and was not herself eligible for the General Stud Book.|$|E

5|$|On October 13, 2006, {{two days}} after the crash, the FAA banned all fixed-winged {{aircraft}} from the East River corridor unless in contact with local air traffic control. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule,</b> which took effect immediately, required all small aircraft (with the exception of helicopters and certain seaplanes) to seek the approval of and stay in contact with air traffic control while in the corridor. The FAA cited safety concerns, especially unpredictable winds from between buildings, as the reason for the change.|$|E

50|$|Earlier in {{the year}} the ALP caucus {{approved}} changes {{to the way the}} federal parliamentary leader is chosen. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>rules</b> {{make it more difficult to}} change leaders and require a ballot of the party membership on contested leadership spills. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>rules</b> encourage <b>the</b> parliamentary party to only nominate one candidate, to avoid a month-long ballot of the general party membership. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>rules</b> are controversial, however, and have been publicly criticised by ALP Senator Stephen Conroy and former Prime Minister Julia Gillard.|$|R

5|$|The media {{predicted}} the Senators to be Stanley Cup contenders, {{as they had}} a strong core back after the lockout, played in an up-tempo style fitting <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> changes and Hasek was expected to provide top-notch goaltending. The team rushed out of the gate, winning 19 of the first 22 games, in the end winning 52 games and 113 points, placing first in the East, and second overall in the League.|$|E
5|$|Several leading batsmen {{opposed the}} new law, {{including}} the professional Herbert Sutcliffe, {{known as an}} exponent of pad-play, and amateurs Errol Holmes and Bob Wyatt. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that these three improved their batting records during the 1935 season, but batsmen generally were less successful. There were also fewer drawn matches. There {{was an increase in}} the number of lbws— out of 1,560 lbw dismissals in first-class matches in 1935, 483 were given under the amended law. Wisden judged the experiment a success and several of its opponents changed their mind by the end of the season; batsmen soon became accustomed to the alteration. Although Australian authorities were less convinced, and did not immediately introduce the revision into domestic first-class cricket, in 1937 <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> became part of the Laws of Cricket.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 World Ice Hockey Championships in Katowice {{were the}} first to feature {{professionals}} although in the end only the United States made use of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule,</b> recalling eight pros from the Minnesota North Stars and Minnesota Fighting Saints. The first fully open World Championship was held in 1977 in Vienna, Austria, and saw the first participation of active Canadian NHL players, including two-time NHL MVP Phil Esposito. Sweden and Finland also augmented their rosters with a few NHL and WHA players. Many of the players on the Canadian team were not prepared for the tournament and were unfamiliar with the international game. The team finished fourth, losing both games to the Soviet Union by a combined score of 19–2. Czechoslovakia won gold, becoming the third team (after Canada and the Soviet Union) to win consecutive championships.|$|E

25|$|The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher {{will not}} cover cases of harm to persons within the {{premises}} where the inherently dangerous activity is carried out, {{for the rule}} requires escape of the thing, which causes harm from the premises. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> makes no distinction between the persons within the premises where the enterprise is operating or and persons outside the premises because escape of the thing causing harm from the premises is not {{a necessary condition for}} the applicability of the rule. Further, the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, though strict {{in the sense that it}} is not dependent on any negligence on the part of the defendant and in this respect similar to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule,</b> is not absolute as it is subject to many exceptions but <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> in Mehta’s case is not only strict but absolute and is subject to no exception.|$|E
