5|$|If {{the grand}} jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to {{the grand jury}}. Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> But, the government may narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrest. Strauss-Kahn, who was head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and considered the front-runner in the French presidential election, was accused of sexually assaulting a maid at a midtown Manhattan hotel in May 2011. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but quit his IMF post, and his presidential candidacy was sidetracked. Subsequently, the case against him weakened as prosecutors said his accuser admitted to lying <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> about events surrounding the attack. Franco Nero portrays a Strauss-Kahn like character, Roberto DiStasio, but he is an Italian dignitary. Ron Rifkin plays DiStasio's defense attorney, who is similar to Strauss-Kahn's real life attorney, Benjamin Brafman.|$|E
5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because {{he was the only one}} who confessed to lying <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E

2500|$|Harvey's [...] "escapade" [...] {{prompted}} the U.S. attorney for Illinois <b>to</b> empanel <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>to</b> consider <b>an</b> espionage indictment; Harvey [...] "went {{on the air}} to suggest he was being set up"; the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> subsequently declined to indict Harvey.|$|R
5|$|After {{the ambush}} the two {{apparent}} shooters {{ran from the}} buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented {{a week before the}} murder by a man who gave the name Lon Celespe. Police, prosecutors and federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with information about his whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not cooperative and lied about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sentiment}} {{was against}} Rowan {{in the matter}} of his duel with Chambers. Soon after the duel, friends of Chambers formed a posse and rode toward Rowan's house. Rowan concocted a ruse whereby he dressed a family slave in his coat and hat and sent him riding from the house on horseback. The posse was fooled into thinking the slave was Rowan and gave chase, but the slave escaped and Rowan's life was spared as well. Days later, the owner of the land where the duel had taken place swore out a warrant for Rowan's arrest for murder. Some accounts hold that, as Commonwealth's Attorney, Rowan's friend Felix Grundy would have been responsible for prosecuting the case against Rowan and that Grundy resigned the position to avoid prosecuting his friend. Grundy's biographer, John Roderick Heller, admits that this was possible, although no evidence exists to confirm it. Heller also points out that Grundy was Commonwealth's Attorney not in Nelson County (the location of Bardstown), but in neighboring Washington County at the time. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss and Colonel William Allen served as counsel for Rowan. The judge opined that there was insufficient evidence to send the case <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> and Rowan was released.|$|E

In addition, the Army arranged for transmission of an audio link of the two-day proceedings to West Point to allow other family members in the area to follow them.|$|E
25|$|The {{grand jury}} {{indictment}} {{clause of the}} Fifth Amendment has not been incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states do employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with preliminary hearing.|$|E
25|$|Snuka was {{the only}} suspect {{involved}} in the subsequent investigation. Although charges were not pressed at the time against Snuka, the case was left officially open. In 1985, Argentino’s parents won a $500,000 default judgment against Snuka in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. Snuka appears not to have ever paid, claiming financial inability. On June 28, 2013, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced that the still-open case would be reviewed by his staff. On January 28, 2014, Martin announced that the case had been turned over <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} into the shooting was handled by the Virginia State Police, while Commonwealth's Attorney Earle C.

50|$|United States v. Kirschner, 823 F. Supp. 2d 665, was {{a federal}} {{criminal}} case in Michigan. The defendant {{had previously been}} indicted by <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> under three counts of receipt of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2)(A). The government sought <b>to</b> use <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> subpoena post-indictment <b>to</b> acquire additional evidence: the contents of an encrypted file from the defendant's hard drive.|$|R
25|$|In 1984 MacFarlane warned {{a congressional}} {{committee}} of scatological behavior and animals being slaughtered in bizarre rituals that children were forced to watch. Shortly after, the United States Congress doubled its budget for child-protection programs. Psychiatrist Roland Summit delivered conferences {{in the wake of}} the McMartin trial and depicted the phenomenon as a conspiracy that involved anyone skeptical of the phenomenon. By 1986, social worker Carol Darling argued <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that the conspiracy reached the government. Her husband Brad Darling gave conference presentations about a Satanic conspiracy of great antiquity which he believed now permeated American communities.|$|E
25|$|On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret {{testimony}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> According to {{news reports}} at the time, Nixon answered {{questions about the}} 18½-minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts {{turned over to the}} House Judiciary Committee, using the Internal Revenue Service to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes. Aided by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the historian Stanley Kutler, who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the Nixon White House tapes, sued for release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.|$|E
25|$|For those {{accused of}} a felony, their case is sent to a court part where felony cases await {{the action of the}} grand jury. If the grand jury finds that there is enough {{evidence}} that the accused has committed a crime, it may file an indictment. If the accused waives their right <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> the prosecutor will file a Superior Court Information (SCI). If the grand jury votes an indictment, the case will be transferred from Criminal Court to the Supreme Court for another arraignment. This arraignment is similar to the arraignment in Criminal Court, and if the accused does not submit a guilty plea, the case will be adjourned to a calendar part.|$|E

50|$|Heavy {{consumption}} of the essential amino acid lysine (as indicated {{in the treatment of}} cold sores) has allegedly shown false positives in some and was cited by American shotputter C. J. Hunter as the reason for his positive test, though in 2004 he admitted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that he had injected nandrolone. A possible cause of incorrect urine test results is the presence of metabolites from other AAS, though modern urinalysis can usually determine the exact steroid used by analyzing the ratio of the two remaining nandrolone metabolites. As a result of the numerous overturned verdicts, the testing procedure was reviewed by UK Sport. On October 5, 2007, three-time Olympic gold medalist for track and field Marion Jones admitted to use of the drug, and was sentenced to six months in jail for lying <b>to</b> <b>a</b> federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in 2000.|$|R
25|$|Ecclesiastical {{courts in}} the American Episcopal Church have {{jurisdiction}} only over disciplinary cases involving clergy and are divided into two separate systems: one for trials of bishops (at {{the level of the}} national Episcopal Church) and the other for trials of priests and deacons (at the level of the diocese for original jurisdiction and at the provincial level for appeals). (At least one diocese, however, Diocese of Minnesota, has provided in its canons for a court with broader jurisdiction over a wide range of canonical issues, although such a court has not yet been implemented by the convention of that diocese.) In each disciplinary case, two courts are provided, one for trials and one for appeals. When a charge is first made, it is brought before an initial review committee (similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in secular criminal law) whose job is to determine when a case should be brought and to supervise the Church Attorney who acts as a sort of prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|Major scandal {{caught up}} to the mayor in his second term. Several of his {{associates}} were indicted for financial malfeasance, including former administration officials Ivanhoe Donaldson and Alphonse G. Hill. Barry began to be plagued by rumors and press reports of womanizing and of alcohol and drug abuse; in particular, stories abounded of his cocaine use in the city's nightclubs and red-light district. In 1983, Barry's ex-wife, Mary Treadwell, was convicted of fraudulently using federal funds given to Pride, Inc., a group that helped local youth find employment. In 1984, Barry's one-time lover Karen Johnson was convicted of cocaine possession and contempt of court for refusing to testify <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> about Barry's drug use. Barry's second four years in office had some high points, including the District's entry into the open bond market with Wall Street's highest credit rating, and Barry's nomination speech for Jesse Jackson at the 1984 Democratic Convention.|$|E
500|$|In a case {{submitted}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> {{the indictment}} must satisfy this requirement.
