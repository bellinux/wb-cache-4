5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over a {{container}} of Epsom salts into <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> where the unconscious Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|From 1749, iron from Pentyrch was {{initially}} {{transported to the}} works using pack-horses, then tub boats were used on the Taff passing onto the feeder via a lock at Radyr Weir. Parts of this lock can still be seen beside the feeder sluice. In 1815 <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> boats were discontinued and a tramway built along the Taff. There is a public picnic site by the Radyr weir.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E
50|$|A path follows <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> up <b>the</b> mountain. Certain {{elements}} of the path are wheelchair accessible and stairs are used in a few select locations to aid in descending the terrain. Also, the shade {{brought about by the}} foliage as well as the coolness of the water and its flow, all contribute to a drop in temperature in close proximity to <b>the</b> <b>tubs.</b> Be wary of loose rocks and slippery moss, for they have a tendency to cause loose footing. There are not many signs that warn of these dangers, so be cautious in hiking the intricacies of <b>the</b> <b>tubs.</b> When construction is completed, Seven <b>Tubs</b> will be <b>the</b> northern terminus of the D&L Trail—a 165 mi, multi-use rail trail.|$|R
50|$|Bird-watchers {{can gain}} {{a glimpse of}} many species of birds through a visitation of <b>the</b> <b>tubs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tubs</b> offer a {{possibility}} to view some of the birds that are becoming a rarity in the northeast region of the state. Depending on the seasonality of the birds {{in the area and}} the time at which hikers and visitors experience <b>the</b> <b>tubs,</b> different bird types can be viewed and observed. Common to the area are the whippoorwill and saw-whet owl, both of which are becoming scarce across much of their normal habitat. Also, the barred owl, rufous-sided towhee, yellow-shafted flicker, brown thrasher, and eastern wood pewee can be seen here. Game birds are frequent to the area as well and include wild turkey and ruffed grouse.|$|R
40|$|Building tall {{has always}} been an {{expression}} of dreams, power and technical advancement. With the greatly increasing urbanization in recent years building tall has become a more viable option for office and residential housing. <b>The</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame concept tries to evolve the stabilizing systems of high-rise buildings with its mega frame around the buildings perimeter, created together with a new elevator system; the Articulated Funiculator. This thesis examines the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame compared to other structural systems. Information and background has been taken from different types of literature, analysis programs and verbally from supervisors; Fritz King and Peter Severin. Using Finite Element Method (FEM-) programs studies on previously used structural systems along with <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame has been made, trying to draw conclusions about its advantages and drawbacks. The examinations have been done using SAP 2000 and ETABS, both developed by CSI. <b>The</b> <b>tubed</b> mega frame shows to require a large amount of concrete compared to other systems at lower heights, because of its geometry. As the height increases it does show an increase in effectiveness and by the time it reaches 480 meters it is using less materials and still achieving greater stiffness than other systems. Since the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>Tubed</b> mega frame is so flexible a conclusion is also made that the stiffness can be increased by sacrificing façade area or creating longer outriggers...|$|R
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass.

5|$|Upon {{discovering}} her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn {{that he is}} the father, {{despite the}} fact that they never actually had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated in <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> and Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility. Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck a chance to prove himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.|$|E

25|$|In {{case of a}} malfunction, {{overload}} {{or wrong}} polarity operating inside the electrolytic capacitor housing, substantial gas pressure can arise. <b>The</b> <b>tubs</b> are designed to open a pressure relief vent and release high pressure gas, including parts of the electrolyte.

25|$|The {{reason for}} this is that human {{activities}} are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere for a complete explanation). This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub. So long as the tap runs water (analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide) into <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> faster than water escapes through the plughole (the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), then the level of water in <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> (analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) will continue to rise.|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} the two rooms (located at the northwerst) {{contains}} two groups of tubs, arranged in radial groups and linked by a system of water pipes. The {{first of the}}se two groups (1 on the plan at right) contains fourteen tubs arranged in a horseshoe pattern. Only two of <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> in this group have been lost. These tubs {{are designed to be}} sat up in, as is normal for Greek bath tubs. There is a semicircular cavity below <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> which must have been intended to catch water which overflowed <b>the</b> <b>tubs.</b> Since there is no drain, this water must have been removed from the room by hand. <b>The</b> <b>tubs</b> are mostly made from a conglomerate cement made of sherds of terracotta and sandstone rubble, although a few of the baths furthest to the west are entirely made in terracotta and are portable (perhaps they belong to the same period as the pavement and, like this, belong to the most ancient period of the bathhouse).The second group (2 on the plan at right) consists of twenty-two tubs arranged in a circle on a conglomerate pavement, but they were all damaged by the destruction of the site and may never have been completed.|$|R

25|$|The Fishes {{are also}} {{associated}} with the German legend of Antenteh, who owned just a tub and a crude cabin when he met a magical fish. They offered him a wish, which he refused. However, his wife begged {{him to return to}} the fish and ask for a beautiful furnished home. This wish was granted, but her desires were not satisfied. She then asked to be a queen and have a palace, but when she asked to become a goddess, the fish became angry and took the palace and home, leaving the couple with <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> and cabin once again. <b>The</b> <b>tub</b> in the story is sometimes recognized as the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
