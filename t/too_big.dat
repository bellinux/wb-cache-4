5|$|In January 1940 Hauptmann (Captain) Wolfgang Falck took {{command of}} I./ZG1. Falck {{came to the}} opinion that the Bf110 {{was just a little}} <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for Ostermann and had him {{transferred}} to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 equipped I./Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG21) on 7April 1940. JG21 at the time was based at Mönchengladbach and was subordinated to Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Max Ibel, the Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of Jagdgeschwader 27.|$|E
5|$|In a later flashback, Locke is in Australia {{talking to}} {{one of the leaders of}} a walkabout.

5|$|The plan {{itself is}} not without controversy, as it has made the local club Kingstonian F.C.'s future very uncertain, with them unable {{to play in a}} ground that is now <b>too</b> <b>big</b> and {{expensive}} for a non-league side and one which they no longer have any decision over.|$|E

5|$|Through 2011, Langan {{executive}} produced Ralph Fiennes' directorial debut Coriolanus, the Marilyn Monroe biopic My Week with Marilyn, and Lynne Ramsay's {{adaptation of}} Lionel Shriver's novel We Need to Talk About Kevin. The project was in development hell since 2007 until Langan realised BBC Films {{was trying to}} get <b>too</b> <b>big</b> a budget to make it with. Ramsay rewrote the script in 2010 to allow a lower budget.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Ezeh {{was unable}} to play {{football}} because he was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for the local leagues according to Grand Rapids area officials. As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, {{even though he was}} not the primary weapon in the backfield. Ezeh was {{also a member of the}} Cougars rugby team that placed 11th at the 2004 United States High School Rugby National Championships.|$|E
5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're <b>too</b> <b>big,</b> you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Oliver Butterworth {{authored}} a children's book, The Enormous Egg. The {{book and}} a movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the NBC Children's Theatre {{tell the story of}} a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby Triceratops. The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes <b>too</b> <b>big,</b> so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence {{is such an}} approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E
5000|$|... "Big Scary Animal" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "It's <b>Too</b> Real (<b>Big</b> Scary Animal)") is a pop song written by Charlotte Caffey, Belinda Carlisle and Ralph Schuckett, {{produced}} by Schuckett for Carlisle's fifth studio album Real (1993).|$|R

5|$|The Russian {{force was}} superior, but faced severe {{logistical}} problems. Count Paskevich's army was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to sustain on food confiscated from captured lands. It relied on provisions transported from Russia, either directly through Polish territory or theoretically neutral Prussia. The epidemic of cholera brought to Poland and East Prussia by Russian soldiers forced the Prussian authorities {{to close their}} borders to Russian transports. To avoid starving his army, Paskevich ordered two permanent bridges built across the Vistula, in Góra and Podgórze. Only the latter one had been completed {{by the start of}} the Russian assault of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets <b>too</b> <b>big</b> or when DLC is installed. Due {{to the nature of}} the game, the longer the player plays, the larger the save file becomes. These same issues plagued , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas seems unlikely. Sawyer said that it is a core-engine issue that can not be so easily patched.|$|E
5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or <b>too</b> <b>big.</b> The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E

5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for the part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit {{what was in the}} script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{producers}} considered having Michael Obiora play both {{the young and}} old version of Billy Shipton. However, {{it was decided that}} Obiora in makeup would look too fake, and so Louis Mahoney was cast to play the older version. Initially, Obiora played the role with a London accent; Mahoney, however, has a thick accent. Obiora had to re-dub his lines to match. Billy mentions that the windows of the TARDIS are the wrong size for a real police box. In 2004, when the first photographs of the new series' TARDIS prop were revealed, there was a vigorous discussion of the box's dimensions on the Outpost Gallifrey Doctor Who discussion forum, in which some fans complained that the prop's windows were <b>too</b> <b>big.</b> Moffat has confirmed that this line is an in-joke aimed at the Outpost Gallifrey forum.|$|E
5|$|The terrier of {{this period}} was short of leg, built in a chunky fashion, and had a skull that was broad across the top. Used in hunting packs and kept in kennels along with English Foxhounds, they were bred {{for their ability to}} drive the fox out of its den. Gradually the pace of the hunt became faster, and the terriers were bred with longer legs for more speed {{towards the end of the}} 18th century. However the {{increased}} size meant that the Fox Terrier became <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to be used for its original purpose, and its use in fox hunting began to decline.|$|E
5000|$|We're {{also going}} {{to reduce the number}} of double and triple points races at a local level for the same reason -- <b>too</b> many <b>big</b> races. The track {{operator}} still has to have the opportunity to hold big races, but we're not going to have nearly as many.|$|R
