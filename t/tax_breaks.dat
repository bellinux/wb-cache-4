5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableIn {{an attempt}} to boost {{business}} investment, the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act gave business owners an income tax deduction of up to $ 100, 000 {{of the purchase price}} of any vehicle greater than 6, 000 pounds used for business purposes. This is a 200 % increase from the previous maximum deduction allowed. This paper estimates the effects of this <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> on the demand for heavy vehicles and attempts to address the efficiency of the policy in terms of both increased business investment and costs imposed by heavier vehicles. The extent to which the policy is successful in increasing business investment depends heavily on whether or not the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> generated new purchases of heavy vehicles. Policy effectiveness is undermined when business owners already planning to buy a vehicle substitute heavier vehicles covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> for lighter vehicles not covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break.</b> Moderate evidence is found of an increase in demand for heavier vehicles. Weak evidence for substitution effects of heavier vehicles covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> for lighter vehicles not covered by the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> is found. The overall evidence suggests a slight increase in the demand for larger vehicles, implying minimal both environmental costs and business investment. This counters most arguments of both the automakers who supported the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> and environmental activists who criticized it. MU Undergraduate Research Scholars Progra...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{considers}} the international tax incentives {{created by the}} American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The temporary dividend repatriation <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> is evaluated {{in the context of}} previ-ous theoretical and empirical work. While this <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> is likely to lead to a surge in temporary repatriations, it is unlikely to encourage new investment in the United States. Instead, the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> sends a confused message about the intent of the U. S. tax system and, to-gether with the other international tax provisions in the legislation, is likely to encourage foreign investment in low–tax countries...|$|R

The Street administration targeted some of the city's worst neighborhoods for revitalization and made considerable progress. <b>Tax</b> <b>breaks</b> created in 1997 and 2000 helped create a condominium boom in Center City, increasing the population of Center City and helping slow the city's 40-year population decline.

5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%.|$|E

After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a subcommittee of three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of the Ford Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> and other incentives if the team relocated.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun {{declared}} the entire {{of the country}} excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> and allocated ₩1.4trillion (KRW, $1.2billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ₩100billion (KRW, $90million USD) in immediate funds for search and rescue missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, {{which led to the}} high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000workers to storm-damaged areas. The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports.|$|E

In February 2008, he voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act, which supporters said would have eliminated $18 billion in tax benefits for oil companies and substituted tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. In May 2008, he voted against the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which supporters said contained provisions to cut <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for oil companies and to expand <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for alternative energies like solar and geothermal power, biodiesel fuels, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In July 2010, he voted against the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, which would have removed federal caps on oil companies' liability for oil spills, and would have cut certain <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for oil companies. In February 2011, he voted against a measure to reinstate royalties assessed for oil drilled when oil prices are high.
