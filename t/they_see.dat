5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images <b>they</b> <b>see,</b> as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning <b>they</b> <b>see</b> in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|Environmentalists, urban {{planners}} and cycling enthusiasts {{around the world}} have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as a success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond the Chicago metropolitan area have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking.|$|E
5|$|Finn {{begins to}} think that Ricardio is a villain, but Jake just notes that Finn is jealous. However, the two spy on Ricardio {{to see if he}} is evil or not. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> Ricardio going into a {{dumpster}} and acquiring a rope and broken bottles. Then <b>they</b> <b>see</b> him throwing the Ice King into the dumpster, so they decide to question Ricardio about being a super-villain. Finn punches Ricardio right when Bubblegum comes. Mad and upset, she takes Ricardio away. However, the Ice King soon crawls toward Finn and Jake, looking sickly. He reveals that Ricardio is actually his own heart, which gained sentience after the Ice King performed a failed love spell. Ricardio desires to cut out Bubblegum's heart and make it his bride.|$|E

5|$|I {{am afraid}} my {{men will be}} very angry when <b>they</b> <b>see</b> it. I cannot {{understand}} why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much {{and the whole thing}} is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled.|$|E
5|$|Refusing to give up, SpongeBob and Patrick peacefully {{petition}} {{to stop the}} highway. Nobody listens to them, however, and they are quickly exiled for their actions. Soon afterwards, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> a parade meant to commemorate the groundbreaking of the highway. The highway is rapidly built and, as SpongeBob predicted, it turns Jellyfish Fields into a wasteland.|$|E
5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E

5|$|As Diane {{has missed}} her flight, she {{suggests}} to Ric that they visit his father's grave. At the graveside, Ric tells Diane about his troubled {{relationship with his}} father, and confesses that he has feelings for her. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> a woman nearby who Diane recognises, having seen Paulina giving her money the day before. Ric confronts her, and discovers she is Esi Griffin (Gloria Acheampong), his father's last wife and widow. She has a son who is not in school, but will not explain her circumstances and tells Ric to speak to Kumi.|$|E
5|$|As Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is terminal, Nier {{sets out}} {{to look for a}} cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, Grimoire Weiss, which {{suggests}} that the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease. In their search, they encounter Kainé, a hot-tempered and foul-mouthed swordswoman; and Emil, a blindfolded boy whose eyes petrify anyone <b>they</b> <b>see.</b> After journeying for a time, the village is attacked by a giant shade; the battle culminates in Yonah being carried away by a master Shade that suddenly appears—the Shadowlord—who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.|$|E
5|$|Avinor {{wants to}} extend most short {{airports}} to 1200 m by year 2030, because <b>they</b> <b>see</b> {{a lack of}} aircraft types which have more than 19 seats able to use 800-meter runways. Dash 8 built after 2009 can't use them. Few countries apart from Norway have such short airports. There is however no room for this at Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats.|$|E

Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has {{much to say about}} perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{over the}} origin of falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved into political discussions {{about the relationship between}} Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for what <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as the appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E

5|$|In Capitalism and Freedom, {{he argued}} that {{conscription}} is inequitable and arbitrary, preventing young men from shaping their lives as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> fit. During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E

Scully, about to perform an autopsy on the intestine, is interrupted when Mona suddenly calls and reports that Bilac was under the influence of Yaje. At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a toilet lid, she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E
