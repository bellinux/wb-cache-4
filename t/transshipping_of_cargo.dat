25|$|Booth's sawmill {{operations}} {{could never}} run at full capacity because the output {{could not be}} carried out of the lumber yards fast enough. Because of these transportation problems in the Ottawa area, Booth became an important participant {{in the development of}} Canada's railway system when he purchased the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway (M) and the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company (C) in 1879, amalgamating them to form the Canada Atlantic Railway. The M had received a charter to build southeast from Ottawa to Coteau Landing on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River. The C had received a charter to build a bridge across the St. Lawrence River to Valleyfield, Quebec and then operate a railway across southwestern Quebec to the United States border. Due to financial difficulties, neither line had been completed, and Booth worked to complete the entire route by 1882. The Coteau bridge was completed in 1890, thus eliminating the necessity <b>of</b> <b>transshipping</b> <b>cargo</b> by barge. The CAR formed a subsidiary, the Vermont and Province Line Railroad, which would build a line to Swanton, Vermont on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain in 1897, thus connecting Ottawa to the United States via the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Rutland Railroad, and the Central Vermont Railway.|$|R
25|$|Hamar Station {{developed}} into a major center for transshipment of goods between narrow and standard gauge rolling stock. By 1912 there was 91,725 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> which was <b>transshipped,</b> all <b>of</b> it for hand. The cost and time restraints on this caused proposals for the Røros Line to receive gauge conversion, mentioned {{for the first time}} in parliamentary discussions in 1890. The 1898 decision to build the Bergen Line in standard gauge marked the end of narrow gauge as an acceptable standard. The Solør Line opened in 1910, connecting to the Røros Line at Elverum, resulting in both Hamar, Elverum and Trondheim having split two-gauge stations and major transshipment operations.|$|R
50|$|Transshipment between HVB and NSB {{initially}} cost HVB NOK 38.25 per car. The track arrangement from Gausen to Holmestrand Station caused {{operational difficulties}} for NSB, {{resulting in a}} new connection track being built. The new section also served Nordisk Aluminium. In 1907 HVB <b>transshipped</b> 114 tonnes <b>of</b> express <b>cargo</b> and 13,553 tonnes <b>of</b> regular <b>cargo</b> to NSB. HVB's cars drove a combined 8042 km on NSB lines. The annual amounts varied, with the express cargo following to 20 tonnes and regular cargo 878 tonnes by 1911. Then traffic rose, reaching 140 and 5,600 tonnes, respectively, in 1920. A peak <b>cargo</b> <b>of</b> 73,196 tonnes was transported in 1915.|$|R

40|$|The article {{gives an}} account of the results of working out a {{generalized}} dynamic model <b>of</b> fixation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads jointly with flexible and thrust elements. Working out a generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> fixation is rather a complicated problem not in the sense of solving differential equations systems but in the sense of presenting them as a complex mechanical system “cargo – pads – flexible elements – thrust bars”. Generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads observed that this model represents technology of joint work of flexible and thrust fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> on rolling stock.

50|$|The {{proposal}} was speculative; the junctions with the broad gauge GWR would still require <b>transshipping</b> <b>of</b> goods and minerals for onward transit, and the eastward spur at Maindee {{did not lead}} to sidings where that might be done. Nevertheless the possibility of the LNWR, who were running passenger trains to Newport over the Monmouthshire line, getting a firmer foothold at Newport was unattractive to the GWR, and it encouraged the new company. At the same time the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company was extremely hostile, as the new line would abstract much of their Eastern Valley business.|$|R
