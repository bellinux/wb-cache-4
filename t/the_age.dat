In {{order to}} {{indicate}} <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> process and evaluate <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> resistance of warm mix asphalt, thin film oven tests of original asphalts and warm mix asphalts were conducted, and the softening points of different asphalts in aging process were compared. Then, using softening point as a parameter, <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> kinetics model was established and the kinetics parameters were also calculated to reflect <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> performance of different asphalts. It is indicated that warm mix asphalt has larger activation energies and lower reaction rate constant {{than those of}} original asphalt, and <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> performance of warm mix asphalt after are better. <b>The</b> <b>aging</b> behavior of warm mix asphalt could be well evaluated by <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> kinetics model...|$|R

The analysis of time periods between the onset of chronic prostatitis symptoms against the background of androgen deficiency in <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male and androgen deficiency in <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male symptoms against the background of chronic prostatitis showed that androgen deficiency in <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male symptoms have been revealed 1 - 2 years earlier than the onset of chronic prostatitis.
