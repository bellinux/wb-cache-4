25|$|The Calais was the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> luxury {{model in}} the VZ range. It sat above the Berlina and {{combined}} luxury with performance. Pricing for the Calais started at A$52,660.|$|E
25|$|Most {{professionals}} {{prefer to}} use automotive grade bases through <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> gravity fed airbrushes. The cost to hire a professional artist will vary from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on location, skill level and reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Monza (900) [...] <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trim <b>line,</b> {{just for}} 1960–63. In 1964, it was below the Monza Spyder, {{which was now}} its own model. For the 1965–66 model year, the Monza ranked below the Corsa in trim level. After the Corsa model was dropped, the Monza was once again <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corvair <b>line</b> for 1967–69. Monzas usually came with bucket seats (although special bench seats were {{available}} in some years). Monzas always had carpets and special trim packages.|$|R

25|$|At its launch, the Taurus was {{available}} in two models, the GL, which was the entry level/value model, and the LX, which was the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> model. The GL was basic, and didn't have many optional features, while the LX came with many standard features and was highly configurable.|$|E
25|$|The Lucerne {{replaced}} {{both the}} upscale LeSabre and <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> Park Avenue in the Buick line-up, with a base price below The Lucerne's that could equal the Park Avenue's with the V8 option. It {{was based on}} a revised G platform, though GM continued to refer to it as the H.|$|E
25|$|The <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> for now, {{is limited}} to the Highline version, with respect to Active, added {{automatic}} climate (climatronic), electric mirrors, electric windows with automatic up/down and full driver side control, chrome inserts on the dashboard, gear shift lever, steering wheel and speed brake handles and lined in leather, finally with fog lights.|$|E
50|$|The cinema, {{originally}} opened as a Greater Union {{was constructed}} on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Joondalup <b>Line</b> railway reserve and opened in 1998. Post 2000, the cinema was then sold to Grand Cinemas.|$|R

50|$|The bath main {{building}} was 214 x 110 meters and the height to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>line</b> was 44 meters (145 ft.); it covered 6.5 acres and could hold an estimated 1,600 bathers.|$|R
25|$|In 1947 a new stamped grille with a {{separate}} upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the bumper guard crossbars, front and rear. All new was an Estate wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in the station wagon market.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> 98 {{series was}} offered in six body styles in 2-door, 4-door and {{convertible}} configurations. Standard equipment included: Roto Hydramatic; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; windshield washer; special wheel discs; clock; courtesy and map lights and padded dash. Upholstery was {{a variety of}} colored cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14inches. Ninety-Eights were now built only in Lansing.|$|E
25|$|US models {{went on sale}} as 2014 {{model year}} {{vehicles}} on June 28, 2013. Early models include IS 250 RWD, IS 250 AWD, IS 350 RWD, IS 350 AWD. In 2015, for the 2016 model year, the IS 250 was discontinued and replaced by the rear wheel drive only IS 200t. The IS 300 is only offered with all-wheel drive, while the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> IS 350 can be ordered with either drivetrain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − Through {{comparing}} {{stress state}} of TEOS and SiLK-embedded structures, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> low-k materials on stress and stress distribution in via-line structures were investigated using three-dimensional finite element analyses. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> TEOS-embedded via-line structures, hydrostatic stress was concentrated at the via and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> where <b>the</b> void was suspected to nucleate. On the other hand, in the via-line structures integrated with SiLK, large von-Mises stress is maintained at the via, thus deformation of via is expected {{as the main}} failure mode. A good correlation between the calculated results and experimentally observed failure modes according to dielectric materials was obtained.

50|$|In the 1970s, Woodland Park, 19 mi up Ute Pass, built a sewage {{treatment}} plant on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>line</b> that forms <b>the</b> pass. As a result, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> springs were made undrinkable during <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, but this has since largely been corrected.|$|R
25|$|The fifth {{generation}} Escort {{was launched}} in South America in 1992, being manufactured in Brazil and Argentina by Autolatina, a joint-venture between Volkswagen and Ford. This resulted with the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> Escort XR3i being equipped with a VW AP 2.0L engine generating 115PS (85kW). This generation also spawned two VW-branded cars with the same mechanics (but different body styles and interiors) called Pointer (five-door hatchback) and Logus, a two-door saloon.|$|E
25|$|The Schiller Piano Company and its Oregon factory {{were once}} the largest {{industry}} in Ogle County. After the company merged with Cable, the pianos they produced were considered <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Though Cable and Conover produced pianos under different brand names, those produced under the Conover name are still highly regarded today. The Schiller Piano Factory was specifically {{included as a}} contributing property when the boundaries for the Oregon Commercial Historic District were conceived in 2006. The historic district {{was added to the}} U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Various engine {{configurations}} were available, initially {{ranging from}} the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> 103kW SOHC 6-cylinder turbo L20ET to the 4-cylinder Z18S and 6-cylinder LD28 diesel versions {{at the other end}} of the scale. The all-new 16-valve DOHC FJ20 engine debuted in late 1981, and was the first four-cylinder engine from any Japanese manufacturer to employ more than two valves per cylinder (see below). Some of the top spec models featured adjustable suspension dampers that could be adjusted while driving, this was another first for mass-produced JDM vehicles. Nissan Glorias and Laurels also used the L series engines, as well as some diesel (Laurel only) variants.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, the Monaco {{name was}} applied for '67 to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premium {{full-sized}} Dodge cars, replacing the Polara 880 at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dodge <b>line.</b> Taking <b>the</b> Monaco's place as a premium full-size model was the Monaco 500, which was available only as a two-door hardtop and convertible.|$|R
30|$|Test panels {{originally}} made in 1993 [4] were re-examined. Each {{test panel}} contained drawing lines in different materials on a preparatory ground layer made from chalk and animal skin glue. Historic pigments ground in oil were painted on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underdrawing <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> test panels have been previously characterized as to pigment particle size and paint thickness [4].|$|R

25|$|As the {{automobile}} marketplace in the U.S. was {{moving away from}} economy towards performance and luxury vehicles, American Motors began removing the historic Rambler name from its larger models. However, the American and Classic models retained their economy car marketing image, {{as well as their}} traditional nameplate. To cement this image, a Rambler American was again the overall winner in the Mobil Economy Run. The mid-trim level 330 model was dropped, leaving the top 440 and base 220 models in the lineup for 1966. The <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> model, available only as a two-door hardtop, saw its name changed from 440-H, to Rogue.|$|E
25|$|Even more confusingly, {{a hybrid}} cable car/funicular line once {{existed in the}} form of the {{original}} Wellington Cable Car, in the New Zealand city of Wellington. This line had both a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, and a balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. This line was rebuilt in 1979 and is now a standard funicular, although it retains its old cable car name.|$|E
25|$|The MT-5 and L {{came with}} a 90-horsepower (67kW) 2.5-litre HSC four-cylinder, {{although}} the 140horsepower (104kW) 3.0-litre Vulcan V6 was optional on the L and standard on the GL and LX models. The MT-5 was equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, while Vulcan models used a newly designed four-speed AXOD automatic, while HSC-equipped cars used the 3-speed ATX automatic. Ford's 3.8-litre Essex V6 {{was added to the}} lineup in 1988 as the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> engine optional on the LX and GL. Although the power output was rated at the same 140horsepower (104kW) as the 3.0-litre engine, this V6 produced 215ft·lbf (291N·m) of torque. The 2.5-litre was dropped in early 1991.|$|E
50|$|During 1971 the 1750 {{series was}} {{superseded}} across the Alfa Romeo range by the 2000 series; at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saloon <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> 1750 Berlina {{gave way to}} the 2000 Berlina. Some 83 final 1750 Berlinas were assembled in 1972. A direct replacement in the 1.8-litre saloon class came that same year, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> all-new Alfa Romeo Alfetta.|$|R

25|$|For 1992, the Taurus was {{available}} in three models; L, GL, and LX. As with the first generation, the L was the basic model, the GL was the mid-priced value model, and the LX was the luxury model. Due to disappointing sales, the L was dropped after 1992, leaving the GL as the entry-level model. For the 1995 model year, a new SE model was added, {{intended to be a}} budget version of the SHO. It was a step above the entry-level GL, a step below the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> LX, and came standard with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor-mounted shifter, as well as a rear spoiler borrowed from the SHO. The SE was never available as a wagon.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Iwata's promotion, Nintendo, though still a {{profitable}} company, was not performing {{as well as other}} console makers. The recently released GameCube was performing poorly compared to competitors, with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox outselling it. His presidency also came {{at the onset of the}} popularization of online gaming, and Nintendo had yet to move into this facet of the market. He took a cautious approach to the issue, stating: [...] "We're not negative toward the idea of going online. We're just practical." [...] He also fostered a relationship between Nintendo and Capcom that improved the GameCube's appeal. During an interview in 2002, Iwata stated that he felt the gaming industry was becoming too exclusive, and he wanted to develop hardware and games that would appeal to all players rather than focusing on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> graphics.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{subsurface}} textile {{irrigation system}} has an impermeable base layer (usually polyethylene or polypropylene), a drip line running along that base, a layer <b>of</b> geotextile on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drip <b>line</b> and, finally, a narrow impermeable layer on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geotextile (see diagram). Unlike standard drip irrigation, <b>the</b> spacing <b>of</b> emitters in <b>the</b> drip pipe is not critical as the geotextile moves the water along the fabric up to 2m from the dripper.|$|R
50|$|Changing {{emissions}} {{regulations in}} Japan and the U.S. forced Porsche {{to withdraw the}} 930 from those markets in 1980. It remained, however, available in Canada. Believing the luxurious 928 gran turismo would eventually replace the 911 as <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Porsche <b>line,</b> Fuhrmann cut back spending on the model, {{and it was not}} until his resignation that the company finally committed the financing to re-regulate the car.|$|R
50|$|The basic shotline has a <b>line</b> {{fixed to}} <b>the</b> weight and the float, {{and does not}} {{compensate}} for depth changes. This is adequate in many circumstances, and has <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> simplicity. If there is any current or wind, the buoy will drift until tension in <b>the</b> <b>line</b> prevents further movement. Large waves will cause the buoy and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to bob up and down, jerking on <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
