5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> step was to build a telescope that could look at {{all parts of the}} sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E

25|$|Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was {{responsible}} for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} prefetch-based disk buffer {{management}} algorithm, {{which we call}} W²R (Weighing/Waiting Room). Instead of using elaborate prefetching schemes to decide which block to prefetch and when, we simply follow the LRU-OBL (One Block Lookahead) approach and prefetch <b>the</b> <b>logical</b> <b>next</b> block along with the block that is being referenced. The basic {{difference is that the}} W²R algorithm logically partitions the buffer into two rooms, namely the Weighing Room and the Waiting Room. The referenced, hence fetched block is placed in the Weighing Room, while <b>the</b> prefetched <b>logical</b> <b>next</b> block is placed in the Waiting Room. By so doing, we alleviate some inherent deficiencies of blindly prefetching <b>the</b> <b>logical</b> <b>next</b> block of a referenced block. Specifically, a prefetched block that is never used may replace a possibly valuable block and a prefetched block, though referenced in the future, may replace a block that is used earlier than itself.

25|$|WIFLP leader Sir Grantley Adams of Barbados became Prime Minister. The {{selection}} of Adams as the Prime Minister was {{indicative of the}} problems the Federation would face. The expected leader of the WIFLP was Norman Manley, Premier of Jamaica, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> choice was Dr. Eric Williams, Premier of Trinidad and Tobago. However, neither had contested the Federal elections, preferring to remain {{in control of their}} respective island power bases. This suggested that the leaders of the two most important provinces did not see the Federation as viable. Similarly, Alexander Bustamante, the Jamaican founder of the DLP, also declined to contest the Federal election, leaving the party leadership to the Trinidadian Ashford Sinanan. The absence of the leading Jamaican politicians from any role at the federal level was to undermine the Federation's unity.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in April 1943, Mussolini had begged Hitler {{to make a}} {{separate}} peace with Stalin and send German troops to the west to guard against an expected Allied invasion of Italy. Mussolini feared that with the losses in Tunisia and North Africa, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> step for Dwight Eisenhower's armies would be to come across the Mediterranean and attack the Italian peninsula. Within {{a few days of}} the Allied landings on Sicily in July 1943, it was obvious Mussolini's army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini to a meeting in Feltre on 19 July 1943. By this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting. His mood darkened further when that same day, the Allies bombed Rome—the first time that city had ever been the target of enemy bombing.|$|E
25|$|Although these {{bandages}} were {{an improvement}} over Larrey’s method, they were far from ideal. They required {{a long time to}} apply and dry and there was often shrinkage and distortion. A great deal of interest had been aroused in Europe around 1800 by a British diplomat, consul William Eton, who described a method of treating fractures that he had observed in Turkey. He noted that gypsum plaster (plaster of Paris) was moulded around the patient’s leg to cause immobilization. If the cast became loose due to atrophy or a reduction in swelling, then additional gypsum plaster was added to fill the space. Adapting the use of plaster of Paris for use in hospitals, however, took some time. In 1828, doctors in Berlin were treating leg fractures by aligning the bones in a long narrow box which was then filled with moist sand. The substitution of plaster of Paris for the sand was <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> step. Such plaster casts did not succeed however as the patient was confined to bed due to the casts being heavy and cumbersome.|$|E
