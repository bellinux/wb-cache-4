5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, the {{population}} of Old Louisville was 11,043, of which 55.9% are white, 35.0% are black, 6.3% are listed as other, and 2.3% are Hispanic. College graduates are 24.5%, people without a high school degree are 22.6%, and people with college experience without a bachelor's degree are 28.4%. Females are 52.3% of {{the population}}, males are 47.7%. Households making less than $15,000 a year are 40.8%; although <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{a function of the}} 27% of residents who are full-time college students. Ironically, Old Louisville has the youngest median age of any Louisville neighborhood and the highest percent of people between the ages of 20-29 (25%).|$|E
5|$|The Andalusian {{horse is}} {{descended from the}} Iberian horses of Spain and Portugal, and derives its name from its place of origin, the Spanish region of Andalusia. Cave {{paintings}} show that horses have been present on the Iberian Peninsula {{as far back as}} 20,000 to 30,000BCE. Although Portuguese historian Ruy d'Andrade hypothesized that the ancient Sorraia breed was an ancestor of the Southern Iberian breeds, including the Andalusian, genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA show that the Sorraia is part of a genetic cluster <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> separated from most Iberian breeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E

5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the}} case of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note the intrinsic connection between ahimsa and satyagraha. Satyagraha is sometimes used to refer to the whole principle of nonviolence, where it is essentially the same as ahimsa, and sometimes used in a “marked” meaning to refer specifically to direct action <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> obstructive, for example in the form of civil disobedience.|$|E

25|$|In her {{introduction}} to Bone Dance, she tells us, “I {{have often been}} identified as a ‘protest poet,’ and although something in me frowns at being so neatly categorized, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> the truth.” A huge element of her poetry is political, which is also unsurprising knowing her involvement in AIM and other Native American movements. As she puts it, “because the political is personal” it becomes a part of the poetry, whether intentionally so or not.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} made up of a sandy core of geestland and {{features}} an extended beach all along its west coast, facing the open North Sea. The east coast instead borders to mud flats and tidal creeks of the Wadden Sea. Sand dunes are a characteristical part of Amrum's landscape, resulting in a vegetation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> made up of heath and shrubs. The island's only forest was planted in 1948. Amrum is a refuge for many species of birds and a number of marine mammals like grey seal or harbour porpoise.|$|E

25|$|Drone doom (also {{known as}} drone metal) is {{a style of}} doom metal <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> defined by drones; notes or chords that are {{sustained}} and repeated throughout a piece of music. Typically, the electric guitar is performed with large amounts of reverb and feedback while vocals, if present, are usually growled or screamed. Songs are often very long and lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense. Drone doom is generally influenced by drone music, noise music and minimalist music. The style emerged in the early 1990s and was pioneered by Earth, Boris and Sunn O))).|$|E
25|$|Traffic circles are {{relatively}} rare in New York City, but Windsor Terrace has three of them, all framing Prospect Park entrances along the park's border. The northernmost, a medium-sized traffic circle named Bartel-Pritchard Square, {{is at the}} intersection of Prospect Park W, Prospect Park SW, and 15th Street, and contains an ornate entrance framed with two columns. Another traffic circle, a small circular asphalt pad <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> delineated with paint and flex-barriers, is at Prospect Park SW and 17th Street. The southernmost, a large traffic circle named Park Circle, is at the convergence of Prospect Park SW, Coney Island Avenue, Parkside Avenue, Ocean Parkway, and Fort Hamilton Parkway, and was reconstructed in 2010. Park Circle's entrance to Prospect Park is designed in a style similar to the Bartel-Pritchard Square entrance.|$|E

25|$|Italian {{historian}} and novelist Valerio Massimo Manfredi {{claimed that the}} movie was almost a plagiarism of his 2002 novel The Last Legion, due to several similarities between the two works. These similarities include the reuse of some tropes and happenings present in the book and, especially, the attempt to give historical reliability to the main characters {{with the concept of}} King Arthur having Roman origins. Indeed, the events of the movie suggest a theory <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> different from the one on which Manfredi's novel is based, in which Artorius Castus isn't even mentioned, and neither is the Sarmatian auxiliary army. According to Manfredi, King Arthurs release and its commercial failure were among the main causes of the problems related to the movie adaptation of his novel, that was in development hell until its release in 2007.|$|E
25|$|From {{the summit}} of Carl Side a system of ridges descends southward towards Millbeck. The main spur runs {{straight}} for a mile, the first half being of gentler gradient and culminating in a large patch of white stones at about 1,600ft. There is a very short rocky arête here, before the spur falls abruptly to the valley floor. On {{the eastern side of}} this section are the crags of Doups. The southern ridge sends out shorter branches on either side, just above the patch of white stones. On the western side across the rocky col of Long Doors is Dodd, a fell on Forestry Commission land <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> wooded. To the east is Carlsleddam, a steep sided spur that appears sharply peaked from below: though less inspiring close up it does have a narrow and airy summit ridge.|$|E
25|$|The in-game {{economy in}} Eve Online {{is an open}} economy <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> player-driven. Non-player {{character}} (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players to learn new skills and blueprints to manufacture ships and modules. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods. Some Trade Goods are only for trade between NPC merchants while others have a functional use and are not good for trade with NPC's. The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture {{almost all of the}} ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy. The in-game currency is ISK (Interstellar Kredits), which is also the currency code of the Icelandic króna, the real-world currency of Iceland, where the Eve Online development studio is located.|$|E
