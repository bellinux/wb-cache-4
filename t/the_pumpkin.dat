5|$|Pumpkin {{bombs were}} {{a means of}} {{providing}} realistic training with non-nuclear bombs for the 509th Composite Group's Boeing B-29 Superfortress crews assigned to drop the atomic bomb. <b>The</b> <b>pumpkin</b> bomb had the same weight, size, and weight distribution as the Fat Man plutonium bomb, giving it the same ballistic and handling characteristics. Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B-29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets.|$|E
5|$|The 12th century Pantokrator monastic complex (1118–36) {{was built}} with {{imperial}} sponsorship as three adjoining churches. The south church, a cross-in-square, has a ribbed dome over the naos, domical vaults in the corners, and a pumpkin dome over the narthex gallery. The north church {{is also a}} cross-in-square plan. The middle church, the third to be built, fills the long space between the two earlier churches with two oval domes of <b>the</b> <b>pumpkin</b> and ribbed types over {{what appear to be}} separate functional spaces. The western space was an imperial mausoleum, whereas the eastern dome covered a liturgical space.|$|E
5|$|The {{shells of}} <b>the</b> <b>pumpkin</b> bomb were {{manufactured}} by two Los Angeles firms, Consolidated Steel Corporation and Western Pipe and Steel Company, while the tail assembly {{was produced by}} Centerline Company of Detroit. After initial development, management {{of the program was}} turned over to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance in May 1945. A total of 486 live and inert training bombs were eventually delivered, at a cost of between $1,000 and $2,000 apiece.|$|E

5|$|Within C.pepo, the pumpkins, the scallops, and {{possibly}} the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of C.pepo have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C.pepo, botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and <b>the</b> <b>pumpkin.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{the demise}} of wooden covered bridge would be seen, as a storm, dubbed <b>the</b> <b>Pumpkin</b> Flood of 1903, struck in October of that year. The storm struck both communities, and the bridge in between, causing the loss of many lives, and on October 17, the toll {{collector}} on the bridge closed off the gate and did not allow any person to cross. At 6:40 that evening, a crash was heard, and seconds later, the bridge was no more, after tumbling into the Delaware River below. Remnants of the bridge were swept downstream, and smashed {{on the side of}} the new Northampton Street Bridge, constructed just a few years before. After the storm cleared, the community of Belvidere put a ferry to Riverton back in almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, some European settlers, who were granted {{warrants}} by William Penn, explored Native American trails in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. On these paths, skirmishes occasionally occurred between settlers and Native Americans. One {{example is the}} Sugarloaf Massacre, {{when a group of}} Native Americans ambushed some soldiers on the Lehigh Path near Nescopeck Creek in 1780. The first mill was built in the Nescopeck Creek watershed in 1788. By 1791, there were four settlers along Nescopeck Creek. In 1795, Samuel Mifflin built a sawmill at the mouth of Nescopeck Creek. A gristmill was built on Nescopeck Creek the same year. A flood of Nescopeck Creek in 1786, known as <b>the</b> <b>Pumpkin</b> Flood, was noted for sweeping large numbers of pumpkins downstream on the creek.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's {{influence}} upon other groups, Greg Kot {{wrote in}} 2001, [...] "Whereas Nirvana spawned countless mini-Nirvanas, <b>the</b> <b>Pumpkins</b> remain an island unto themselves." [...] Still, some artists and bands {{have been influenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Pumpkins,</b> such as Nelly Furtado, Marilyn Manson, Tegan and Sara, Panic! at the Disco, and members of My Chemical Romance. My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way has said that they pattern their career upon the Pumpkins', including music videos.

5|$|The pair's {{pumpkins}} {{growth is}} slow, and Seth and Emma often clash during their collaboration. They grow closer while watching old films together and discussing their pasts.

When they are interviewed by Emma as part of her show, <b>the</b> <b>Pumpkin</b> Widows share stories of their husbands' obsessions with growing pumpkins. Emma and Seth sneak onto the mayor's farm to find out his pumpkin growing secrets. Emma asks Seth on a date while they appear at a promotional photo shoot in Seattle. Their date is interrupted by Emma accepting an offer from a television executive to be an anchor on a New York City morning news program. The pair's pumpkin starts growing larger; Emma finds the real pumpkin growing journal and learns that the other book was actually Walt's poems to his wife. Emma and Seth win the contest, and beat the record. Rejecting the New York job offer, Emma starts her own talk show in Valleyville along with Seth.

25|$|When ripe, <b>the</b> <b>pumpkin</b> can be boiled, steamed, or roasted. In {{its native}} North America, it {{is a very}} important, {{traditional}} part of the autumn harvest, eaten mashed and making its way into soups and purees.

25|$|The Adena Indians used {{ceremonial}} pipes {{that were}} exceptional works of art. They lived in round shaped (double post method) wicker sided and bark sheet roofed houses (McMichael 1968:21). Little {{is known about}} the housing of Paleo-Indian and Archaic periods, but Woodland Indians lived in wigwams. They grew sunflowers, tubers, gourds, squash and several seeds such as lambsquarter, may grass, sumpweed, smartweed and little barley cereals. In the Fort Ancient period, Indians lived in much larger poled rectangular shaped houses with walls hide covered (McMichael 1968:38). They were farmers who cultivated large fields around their villages, concentrating on corn, beans, tubers, sunflowers, gourds and many types of squash including <b>the</b> <b>pumpkin.</b> They also raised domestic turkeys and kept dogs as pets. Their neighbors in the northerly of the state, the Monongahelan houses were generally circular in shape often with nook or storage appendage.
