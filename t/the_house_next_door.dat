5|$|On {{the night}} of 27–28 February 1917, Michael {{attempted}} to return to Gatchina from Petrograd, {{where he had been}} in conference with Rodzianko and from where he had telegraphed the Tsar, but revolutionary patrols and sporadic fire prevented his progress. Revolutionaries patrolled the streets, rounding up people connected with the old regime. Michael managed to reach the Winter Palace, where he ordered the guards to withdraw to the Admiralty, because it afforded greater safety and a better tactical position, and because it was a less politically charged location. Michael himself took refuge in the apartment of an acquaintance, Princess Putyatina, on Millionnaya street. In the neighbouring apartments, the Tsar's Chamberlain Nikolai Stolypin and the Procurator of the Holy Synod were detained by revolutionaries and in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> General Baron Staekelberg was killed when his house was stormed by a mob.|$|E

25|$|Soane {{demolished}} {{and rebuilt}} three houses in succession {{on the north}} side of Lincoln's Inn Fields. He began with No. 12 (between 1792 and 1794), externally a plain brick house.

Soon after the four ex-housemates entered <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Door,</b> ICSTIS released a statement confirming that it was dealing with over 2,500 complaints and launched an official investigation.

25|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Carrisford and his Indian {{assistant}} Ram Dass {{have moved}} into <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> to Miss Minchin's school. Carrisford had been Captain Crewe's friend and partner in the diamond mines. After the diamond mine venture failed, both Crewe and Carrisford became very ill, and Carrisford in his delirium abandoned his friend Crewe, who died of his 'jungle fever.' As it turned out, the diamond mines did not fail, but instead were a great success, making Carrisford extremely rich. Although Carrisford survived, he suffers from several ailments and is guilt-ridden over abandoning his friend. He is determined to find Crewe's daughter and heir, although {{he does not know}} where she is and thinks she is attending school in France or Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Under the 1830 Act any householder {{who paid}} rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £ today), to sell beer or cider {{in his home}} (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises. The {{permission}} did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels {{on a table in}} the corner of the room. Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> to live in, turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.|$|E
25|$|In January 1990, the {{congregation}} bought <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> <b>door,</b> {{on the north}} side of the building. Renovations were completed a year later, in 1991. Known as the Annex Building, it is used for daily prayers and Torah study. The building also contains office space. In 1996, extensive renovations were done to Social Hall area of the building. The hall was demolished, and a new more modern banquet hall was built in its place. Additionally, a new synagogue building known as B'nei Shaare Zion capable of seating upwards of 250 worshipers, a Beth midrash with dual use as a prayer space on an upper level, and a secondary synagogue along with several meeting rooms on a lower level were built as well. During the 2000s, restoration work was carried out on the dome of the main sanctuary after forty years of continuous exposure to the elements.|$|E

25|$|Wellesley {{was born}} into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family in Ireland as The Hon. Arthur Wesley, the third of five {{surviving}} sons (fourth otherwise) to Anne and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His mother was the eldest daughter of The 1st Viscount Dungannon. As such, he belonged to the Protestant Ascendancy. His biographers mostly follow the same contemporary newspaper evidence in {{saying that he was}} born on 1 May 1769, the day before he was baptised. His birthplace is uncertain. He was most likely born at his parents' townhouse, 24 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, now the Merrion Hotel. But his mother Anne, Countess of Mornington, recalled in 1815 that he had been born at 6 Merrion Street, Dublin. Other places have been put forward as the location of his birth, including Mornington House (<b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> on Upper Merrion), as his father had asserted; the Dublin packet boat; and the mansion in the family estate of Athy (consumed in the fires of 1916), as the Duke apparently put on his 1851 census return.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, a {{young man}} accosted Romalis in the medical {{building}} where he works and stabbed him. The doctor was not seriously injured. The criminal was not identified. Several witnesses had seen the attacker waiting for some time before Romalis arrived and even used a restroom in a pharmacy that opens onto the lobby. They described him as a white man in his 20s or 30s wearing a dark grey or black sweatsuit with a hood. When Romalis arrived, the attacker stabbed {{him in the back}} of the lower left ribcage. The man escaped through the parking lot of the building. A parking valet, Jesse Brouwer, chased the attacker for more than a block without success. News reports stated that about an hour before the stabbing, police were called to another clinic, Everywoman's Health Centre because of aggressive anti-abortion protesters on the lawn of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> <b>door.</b> Three white men, two of whom had not been there before, were trying to intimidate women entering the clinic. The staff became so concerned about the level of intimidation that they called police. After police talked to them, the three men left about noon. Romalis was stabbed just before 1 p.m.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} series to feature more than 20 housemates. Prior to {{the launch of the}} series, a Golden Ticket {{competition}} was promoted to find a housemate who would enter in Week 3. Adjacent to the house was <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Door,</b> which was used three times throughout the series. The major controversy of this series was the return of four ex-housemates in the penultimate week, with one of them being eligible to remain in the house for the final week. Although this had been practiced in Big Brother 4 in 2003, the main controversy was that the returning housemate was eligible to win, despite being evicted via public vote. Nominations remained a fundamental part of the process, however Big Brother often changed or cancelled nominations some weeks in favour of twists. Double evictions - which had only ever been used on Big Brother 4 and celebrity series' - returned this year and have since become a permanent fixture in all subsequent series - usually near the end of each series. This series proved to be popular, having a series average of 4.7 million viewers. In 2010, Big Brother 7 was voted the public's favourite series of Big Brother, as revealed during Big Brother's Big Awards Show.|$|E
