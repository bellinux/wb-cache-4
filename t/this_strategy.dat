By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. <b>This</b> <b>strategy,</b> which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E

5|$|By 1966, Reynolds {{had grown}} weary of touring and Stewart wanted {{to strike out}} on his own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber {{developed}} an exit strategy of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967.

On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River {{against the advice of}} his officers.

The occlusion region is detected by considering {{their influence on}} the face projection in a suitable face space. Then, the non-occluded region is used to restore the missing information.

Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> would separate the American colonies of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{naval campaign}} of 1806 was {{fought in the}} Atlantic Ocean, following a raid by two large French battle squadrons on British trade routes, focused particularly on the Caribbean. The security of the French Caribbean was under severe threat during the wars, as the Royal Navy dominated the region and restricted French movements both between the islands and between the West Indies and France itself. This dominance was enforced by rigorous blockade, in which British ships attempted {{to ensure that no}} French military or commercial vessel was able to enter or leave French harbours both in Europe and in the French colonies. In the Caribbean, <b>this</b> <b>strategy</b> was designed to destroy the economies and morale of the French West Indian territories in preparation for attack by British expeditionary forces. To counter <b>this</b> <b>strategy,</b> the French government repeatedly sent convoys and individual warships to the French Caribbean islands with supplies of food, military equipment and reinforcements. These resupply efforts ranged from small individual corvettes to large battle squadrons and were under orders to avoid conflict wherever possible. Despite these orders, many were intercepted by British blockade forces, either in the Caribbean or off the French coast itself.|$|E
5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategy}} proved successful, {{according to}} Alberts, when the released head-started iguanas reacted to predators, foraged for food, and behaved like their wild-born counterparts. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> has been implemented {{with great success}} with other critically endangered species of Cyclura and Ctenosaura throughout the West Indies and Central America, notably the Jamaican iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana, Ricord's iguana, Allen Cays iguana, Acklins ground iguana, and Anegada iguana.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} approach to Arctic exploration had relied on large-scale forces, with a presumption that European techniques could be successfully transplanted into the hostile polar climate.

By contrast, Nansen's method of using small, trained crews, and harnessing Inuit and Sami expertise in his methods of travel, had ensured that his expedition was completed without a single casualty or major mishap.|$|E
5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. <b>This</b> <b>strategy</b> is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table.
