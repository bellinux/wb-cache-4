They are considered [...] "negative" [...] players, and are often used on players that are deemed {{to be the most}} dangerous and have the most impact in a game. Taggers possess a high level of fitness and can run with such star players all day and often players from an athletic background who do not possess good passing or ball handling skills will be <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>tag</b> <b>a</b> player.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Providing image {{annotations}} is a tedious task. This {{becomes even}} more cumbersome when objects shall be annotated in the images. Such region-based annotations {{can be used in}} various ways like similarity search or as training set in automatic object detection. We investigate the principle idea of finding objects in images by looking at gaze paths from users, viewing images with an interest in a specific object. We have analyzed 799 gaze paths from 30 subjects viewing imagetag-pairs with the task to decide whether <b>a</b> <b>tag</b> could be found in the image or not. We have compared 13 different fixation measures analyzing the gaze paths. The best performing fixation measure is able <b>to</b> correctly <b>assign</b> <b>a</b> <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> region for 63 % of the image-tag-pairs and significantly outperforms three baselines. We look into details of the image region characteristics such as the position and size for incorrect and correct assignments. The influence of aggregating multiple gaze paths from several subjects with respect to improving the precision of identifying the correct regions is also investigated. In addition, we look into the possibilities of discriminating different regions in the same image. Here, we are able to correctly identify two regions in the same image from different primings with an accuracy of 38 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Ubiquitous {{computing}} targets {{the provision}} of seamless services and applications by providing an environment that involves a variety of devices having different capabilities. The design of applications in these environments needs to consider the heterogeneous devices, applications preferences, and rapidly changing contexts. RFID and WSN technologies are widely used in today’s ubiquitous computing. In Wireless Sensor Networks, sensor nodes sense the physical environment and send the sensed data to the sink by multi-hops. WSN are used in many applications such as military and environment monitoring. In Radio Frequency Identification, a unique ID is <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> RFID <b>tag</b> which {{is associated with a}} real world object. RFID applications cover many areas such as Supply Chain Management (SCM), healthcare, library management, automatic toll collection, etc. The integration of both technologies will brin...|$|R
40|$|Bilingual {{machine-readable}} dictionaries are knowledge resources {{useful in}} many automatic tasks. However, compared to monolingual computational lexicons like WordNet, bilingual dictionaries typically provide a lower amount of structured {{information such as}} lexical and semantic relations, and often do not cover {{the entire range of}} possible translations for a word of interest. In this paper we present Cycles and Quasi-Cycles (CQC), a novel algorithm for the automated disambiguation of ambiguous translations in the lexical entries of a bilingual machine-readable dictionary. The dictionary is represented as a graph, and cyclic patterns are sought in this graph <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>an</b> appropriate sense <b>tag</b> <b>to</b> each translation in a lexical entry. Further, we use the algorithm’s output {{to improve the quality of}} the dictionary itself, by suggesting accurate solutions to structural problems such as misalignments, partial alignments and missing entries. Finally, we successfully apply CQC to the task of synonym extraction. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the duality hypothesis of search and tagging, two important behaviors of web users. The hypothesis states {{that if a}} user views a document D in the search results for query Q, the user would tend <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> document $D$ <b>a</b> <b>tag</b> identical to or similar to Q; similarly, if <b>a</b> user <b>tags</b> <b>a</b> document D with <b>a</b> <b>tag</b> T, the user would tend to view document D {{if it is in}} the search results obtained using T as a query. We formalize this hypothesis with a unified probabilistic model for search and tagging, and show that empirical results of several tasks on search log and tag data sets, including ad hoc search, query suggestion, and query trend analysis, all support this duality hypothesis. Since the availability of search log is limited due to the privacy concern, our study opens up a highly promising direction of using tag data to approximate or supplement search log data for studying user behavior and improving search engine accuracy...|$|R
