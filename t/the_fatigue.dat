40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{prior to the}} {{establishment}} of a method for the clinical diagnosis of chronic fatigue in humans, we validated the utility of plasma metabolomic analysis in a rat model of fatigue using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). In order to obtain a fatigued animal group, rats were placed in a cage filled with water to a height of 2. 2 cm for 5 days. A food-restricted group, in which rats were limited to 10 g/d of food (around 50 % of the control group), was also assessed. The food-restricted group exhibited weight reduction similar to that of <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> group. CE-MS measurements were performed to evaluate the profile of food intake-dependent metabolic changes, as well as <b>the</b> profile in <b>fatigue</b> loading, resulting in the identification of 48 metabolites in plasma. Multivariate analyses using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis revealed that the plasma metabolome in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> group showed clear differences from those in the control and food-restricted groups. In <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> group, we found distinctive changes in metabolites related to branched-chain amino acid metabolism, urea cycle, and proline metabolism. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> group exhibited significant increases in valine, leucine, isoleucine, and 2 -oxoisopentanoate, and significant decreases in citrulline and hydroxyproline compared with the control and food-restricted groups. Plasma levels of total nitric oxide were increased in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> group, indicating systemic oxidative stress. Further, plasma metabolites involved in the citrate cycle, such as cis-aconitate and isocitrate, were reduced in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> group. <b>The</b> levels of ATP were significantly decreased in the liver and skeletal muscle, indicative of a deterioration in energy metabolism in these organs. Thus, this comprehensive metabolic analysis furthered our understanding of <b>the</b> pathophysiology of <b>fatigue,</b> and identified potential diagnostic biomarkers based on fatigue pathophysiology...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES:Our study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} <b>the</b> impact of <b>fatigue</b> on <b>the</b> severity of stroke {{and to explore}} the underlying mechanisms. METHODS:Fatigued male rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion and the infarcted brain area was determined. Then, coagulation parameters were assessed in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> group and a control group. In addition, the level of fibrinogen was determined in rats deprived of sleep for various numbers of days. To study whether interleukin- 6 was involved in fibrinogen synthesis during fatigue, we also measured levels of interleukin- 6 in rats deprived of sleep for various numbers of days. Furthermore, brain injury by middle cerebral artery occlusion was measured in wild-type mice, interleukin- 6 -/- mice and wild-type mice treated with bezafibrate. RESULTS:More severe cerebral infarction was observed in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> rats, resulting in an infarct ratio of 23. 4 %. The infarct ratio was significantly increased in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> rats compared with that {{in the control group}} (8 %, p< 0. 05). The level of fibrinogen was increased significantly in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> rats compared with that in the control group. In addition, a marked reduction in fibrinogen level was observed in <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> interleukin- 6 -/- mice compared to their wild-type counterparts, whereas no difference was observed between fatigued wild-type mice and interleukin- 6 -/- rats treated with recombinant human interleukin- 6. The reduction in brain injury due to middle cerebral artery occlusion during fatigue was observed in interleukin- 6 -/- mice and wild-type mice treated with bezafibrate.

5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of <b>the</b> <b>fatigue</b> failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes.

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about <b>the</b> <b>fatigue.</b> He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry.

NSB stated that they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line. There was also a misunderstanding in the approval, as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line, while the inspectorate had the impression that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line.

40|$|Background: Fatigue is {{commonly}} reported by cancer patients. In some instances it can persist after treatment is completed. In {{order to develop}} effective treatment strategies {{it is important to}} understand the mechanisms underlying <b>the</b> development of <b>fatigue</b> and to be able to predict those that may be at greatest risk of experiencing fatigue during and following treatment. The current paper examines predisposing factors for fatigue including altered fatty acid homeostasis in a cohort of breast cancer radiotherapy patients. Methodology: Patients had undergone breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant breast irradiation. Prior to radiotherapy the patients were free from significant fatigue. Levels of fatigue were determined prior to and following radiotherapy using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy fatigue subscale. Plasma fatty acid levels, urinary and plasma amino acid levels, blood biochemistry factors and general health and lifestyle characteristics were assessed. Results: Following radiotherapy, significant fatigue affected approximately one third of the 26 patients and these subjects were then assigned to <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> cohort. Univariate analysis revealed that higher levels of the fatty acids myristic acid and eicosadienoic acid were present for <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> cohort prior to radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis also revealed that fatty acid homeostasis was altered between <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> and non-fatigued groups at baseline. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis of the general health, lifestyle and metabolic data revealed that <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> and non-fatigued patients could be clustered into two clearly separate groups. Conclusions: The results supported the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>fatigued</b> patients had an underlying metabolic homeostasis which may predispose them to <b>the</b> development of <b>fatigue.</b> Biochemical and general health profiling of breast cancer patients has the potential to identify those at most risk of developing significant fatigue following radiotherapy...|$|R

Little is known about the interaction between the underlying central mechanisms driving motor behaviour and cognitive functions. To address this issue, subjects performed four tasks: an auditory choice reaction task (CRT), a CRT simultaneously with a fatiguing or a non-fatiguing submaximal muscle contraction task, and a fatiguing submaximal contraction task alone. Results showed that performance in the single-CRT condition was relatively stable. However, in <b>the</b> <b>fatiguing</b> dual-task condition, performance levels in the cognitive CRT deteriorated drastically with time-on-task. Moreover, in <b>the</b> <b>fatiguing</b> dual-task condition <b>the</b> rise in force variability was significantly larger than during <b>the</b> <b>fatiguing</b> submaximal contraction alone. Thus, our results indicate a mutual interaction between cognitive functions and the central mechanisms driving motor behaviour during <b>fatigue.</b> <b>The</b> precise nature of this interference, and at what level this interaction takes place is still unknown...|$|R
