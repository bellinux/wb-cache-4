50|$|Swing {{has also}} been {{complicated}} since the 1970s as the constituent areas of Britain have become increasingly fractured. This has led <b>to</b> <b>swings</b> being very different in different areas - for instance, 1992 saw a <b>swing</b> <b>to</b> the Conservatives in Scotland, but a <b>swing</b> <b>to</b> Labour in the South East of England.|$|R
5|$|The College Republicans quickly {{pursued a}} {{strategy}} of sending college students to vote in their home districts and registering others to vote where they schooled <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> closely contested districts. This strategy was successfully implemented for the 1900 presidential election between William McKinley and William Jennings Bryan, helping win Bryan's home state of Nebraska for McKinley.|$|E

He also scored 36 runs at 36.00 in the ODIs. His ability <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> the ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation {{that he could}} become an all rounder. In recognition of his performances {{at the start of}} his international career, Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004.|$|E

Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness; Moon, Samson and the Answer charged at the galleys. Spinola seeing this decided <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> his galleys round to face the South East, the direction of the Flanders coast but in so doing the lead ship San Felipe (St. Philip) ran straight into the Victory and Hope forcing the galleys inadvertently further East.|$|E

5|$|It {{soon came}} time to name the new highway, and an {{upcoming}} visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth {{proved to be the}} focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> out, revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{also used}} the party's brand to {{continue}} this modernisation, and {{it was used to}} communicate the modernisation of the party to the public; the party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sihanouk was {{surprisingly}} acquiescent {{about the whole}} affair. He was {{under pressure from the}} U.S. to reopen diplomatic ties and to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk felt that this was a propitious moment <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E

The incident happened while crew members were changing out a set. The battle on the Himalayas was shot in a New Orleans warehouse previously used to build NASA rockets, that had been fitted with a green screen wall at a very steep angle {{with a lot of}} rigging above <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> the stunt people through.|$|E
5|$|The Ingeborg, {{built in}} 1776, had an eight-12-pounder {{centerline}} armament which {{was open to}} the elements, but two heavy 18-pounders in the bow and two 6-pounder chase guns in the stern. The rowing benches with room for three men per bench were {{on either side of}} the centerline battery, but had <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> forwards and outwards to allow the guns to pivot to either side.|$|E
5|$|The {{lightness}} and rigidity of {{the blade}} compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E

50|$|The {{counter-cyclical}} {{nature of}} producer support is also harmful to developing-country producers. High-income farmers are insulated from changes in world prices, making production less responsive <b>to</b> <b>swings</b> in demand. As a result, world commodity prices are more volatile, and {{the burden of}} adjustment falls disproportionately on developing-country producers.|$|R
5|$|A Floorless Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer SÃ¶hne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> Vindictive broadside on {{into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E

5|$|As Diá»m had {{strongly}} discriminated along religious lines, the rebels' commented {{caused a}} negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau called on Buddhists {{to support the}} incumbent junta.

They thought that Tháº£o and Phat might seek revenge, driving many anti-Diá»m officers who may have otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> more towards KhÃ¡nh.|$|E
5|$|As Diá»m had {{strongly}} discriminated {{in favor}} of minority Catholics and placed restrictions on Buddhism, the rebels' radio addresses caused an unsurprisingly negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau spoke from a radio station in Nha Trang, exhorting his co-religionists to support the incumbent junta. The Diemist speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist or anti-Diá»m generals, such as Thi and CÃ³, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diá»m respectively, and feared retribution from Tháº£o and PhÃ¡t.

The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, KapitÃ¤n von Karpf tried to find a path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape.|$|E

50|$|Rotator cuff {{injuries}} are {{commonly associated with}} motions that require repeated overhead motions or forceful pulling motions. Such {{injuries are}} frequently sustained by athletes whose actions include making repetitive throws, athletes such as baseball pitchers, softball pitchers, American football players (especially quarterbacks), cheerleaders, weightlifters (especially powerlifters due to extreme weights used in the bench press), rugby players, volleyball players (due <b>to</b> their <b>swinging</b> motions), water polo players, rodeo team ropers, shot put throwers (due to using poor technique), swimmers, boxers, kayakers, western martial artists, fast bowlers in cricket, tennis players (due to their service motion) and tenpin bowlers due <b>to</b> the repetitive <b>swinging</b> motion of the arm {{with the weight of}} a bowling ball. This type of injury also commonly affects orchestra conductors, choral conductors, and drummers (due, again, <b>to</b> <b>swinging</b> motions).|$|R
