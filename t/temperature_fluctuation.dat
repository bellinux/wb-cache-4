Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the freezing point and boiling point of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth).

(This compares to {{a volume of}} 2.85million cubic kilometres for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350km and a maximum thickness of 3km. Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which were formerly believed to form {{as a result of}} differential solar heating, coupled with the sublimation of ice and condensation of water vapor. Recent analysis of ice penetrating radar data from SHARAD has demonstrated that the spiral troughs are formed from a unique situation in which high density katabatic winds descend from the polar high to transport ice and create large wavelength bedforms. [...] The spiral shape comes from Coriolis effect forcing of the winds, much like winds on earth spiral to form a hurricane. [...] The troughs did not form with either ice cap, instead they began to form between 2.4 million and 500,000 years ago, after three fourths of the ice cap was in place.

The PDF of the <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> has a long tail. More than 70 % power of the SZ effect <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> attributes to top ∼ 1 % wavelet modes (long tail events). On the other hand, the CMB <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> basically are Gaussian. Although the mean power of CMB <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on sub-degree scales {{is much higher than}} that of SZ effect map, the SZ effect <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> associated with top 2 MASS clusters is comparable to the power of CMB <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on the same scales. Thus, from noisy WMAP maps, one can have a proper estimation of the SZ effect power at the positions of the top 2 MASS clusters. The power spectrum given by these top wavelet modes is useful to constrain the parameter of density fluctuations amplitude σ 8. We find that the power spectrum of these top wavelet modes of SZ effect on sub-degree scales basically is consistent with the simulation maps produced with σ 8 = 0. 84. The simulation samples of σ 8 = 0. 74 show, however, significant deviation from detected SZ power spectrum. It can be ruled out with confidence level 99 % if all other cosmological parameters are the same as that given by the three-year WMAP results.

Short duration wind tunnels such as shock tunnels and gun tunnels rely on a transient compression rocess and are likely to generate significant turbulent fluctuations in the nozzle reservoir region. In the present study, the magnitude of likely stagnation <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in two such facilities is inferred from incompressible <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuations</b> data obtained by other workers. The friction velocity Reynolds numbers for the gun tunnel and shock tunnel cases considered presently were ReT= 31, 579 and 24, 975 respectively.

2500|$|Most wine racks are {{designed}} to allow a wine to be stored on its side. The thinking behind this orientation is that the cork {{is more likely to}} stay moist and not dry out if it is kept in constant contact with the wine. Some wineries package their wines upside down in the box for much the same reason. Research in the late 1990s suggested that the ideal orientation for wine bottles is at a slight angle, rather than completely horizontal. This allows the cork to maintain partial contact with the wine in order to stay damp but also keeps the air bubble formed by a wine's ullage at the top rather than {{in the middle of the}} bottle if the wine is lying on its side. Keeping the ullage near the top, it has been argued, allows for a slower and more gradual oxidation and maturation process. This is because the pressure of the air bubble that is the ullage space rises and falls depending on <b>temperature</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> When exposed to higher temperatures the bubble's pressure increases (becomes positive relative to the air outside of the bottle), and if the wine is tilted at an angle, this compressed gas will diffuse through the cork and not harm the wine. [...] When the temperature falls the process reverses. [...] If the wine is completely on its side then this action will eject some wine through the cork. Through this [...] "breathing" [...] which can result from variations in temperature, oxygen may be repeatedly introduced into the bottle and as a result, can react with the wine. [...] An appropriate and constant temperature is therefore preferred. Additionally, oxidation will occur more rapidly at higher temperatures and gases dissolve into liquids faster the lower the temperature.|$|E
