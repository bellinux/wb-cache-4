5|$|Bulgaria's {{relations}} with the Russian Federation are currently on a good or fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage.

During the Cold War, Bulgaria became an ally of the Soviet Union as a satellite state. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations between Bulgaria and Russia still share many different opinions, such as the two World Wars when Bulgaria both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.|$|E
