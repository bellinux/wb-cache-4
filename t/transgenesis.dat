25|$|In the 1970 and 1980s, {{scientists}} {{passed this}} hurdle by inventing procedures for combining the DNA of two vastly different species with genetic engineering. The organisms produced by these procedures were termed transgenic. <b>Transgenesis</b> {{is the same}} as gene therapy {{in the sense that they}} both transform cells for a specific purpose. However, they are completely different in their purposes, as gene therapy aims to cure a defect in cells, and <b>transgenesis</b> seeks to produce a genetically modified organism by incorporating the specific transgene into every cell and changing the genome. <b>Transgenesis</b> will therefore change the germ cells, not only the somatic cells, in order to ensure that the transgenes are passed down to the offspring when the organisms reproduce. Transgenes alter the genome by blocking the function of a host gene; they can either replace the host gene with one that codes for a different protein, or introduce an additional gene.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{historically}} few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable {{progress has been made}} recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and somatic cell <b>transgenesis</b> in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An NIH-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has {{led to the creation of}} the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal.|$|E
2500|$|Genetically {{modified}} livestock are organisms {{from the}} group of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, birds, horses and fish kept for human consumption, whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. [...] In some cases, {{the aim is to}} introduce a new trait to the animals which does not occur naturally in the species, i.e. <b>transgenesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{location}} and precision of the transgenic process, an enzyme known as Cre has been introduced. [...] Cre {{has proven to be}} a key element in a process known as recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). [...] While it has shown to have a lower efficiency of transgenic transformation than the P element transposases, Cre greatly lessens the labor-intensive abundance of balancing random P insertions. Cre aids in the targeted <b>transgenesis</b> of the DNA gene segment of interest, as it supports the mapping of the transgene insertion sites, known as loxP sites. [...] These sites, unlike P elements, can be specifically inserted to flank a chromosomal segment of interest, aiding in targeted <b>transgenesis.</b> [...] The Cre transposase is important in the catalytic cleavage of the base pairs present at the carefully positioned loxP sites, permitting more specific insertions of the transgenic donor plasmid of interest.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} concerning <b>transgenesis</b> in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. [...] This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern. [...] The transfer of transgenes into the Drosophila genome has been performed using various techniques, including P element, Cre-loxP, and ΦC31 insertion. [...] The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the Drosophila genome utilizes P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a complementary sequence in the host’s genome. [...] P elements are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest. [...] Additionally, P elements often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the P element transposase and the other, the P transposon backbone. [...] The transposase plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P transposon backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the transposon. Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome. While this method has been proven effective, the insertion sites of the P elements are often uncontrollable, resulting in an unfavorable, random insertion of the transgene into the Drosophila genome.|$|E

50|$|Transgenic Xenopus for {{studying}} transcriptional regulation of human disease genes: Xenopus embryos develop rapidly, so <b>transgenesis</b> in Xenopus is a rapid and effective method for analyzing genomic regulatory sequences. In a recent study, mutations in the SMAD7 locus were revealed {{to associate with}} human colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the mutations lay in conserved, but noncoding sequences, suggesting these mutations impacted the patterns of SMAD7 transcription. To test this hypothesis, the authors used Xenopus <b>transgenesis,</b> and revealed this genomic region drove expression of GFP in the hindgut. Moreover, transgenics made with the mutant version of this region displayed substantially less expression in the hindgut.|$|E
