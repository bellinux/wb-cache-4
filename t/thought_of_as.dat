5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have been <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin and {{daunorubicin}} together can be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent {{research has}} led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 {{of them had been}} evaluated in the screening program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA.|$|E

5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws {{to crush the}} shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, {{some have suggested that}} they were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records {{the same information}} as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While traditionally <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more and more people have adopted it as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E

5|$|General homomorphisms {{can also}} be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a kind of coloring: if the {{vertices}} of a fixed graph H are the available colors and edges of H describe which colors are compatible, then an H-coloring of G is an assignment of colors to vertices of G such that adjacent vertices get compatible colors.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational waves, {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate {{at the speed}} of light, and can be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> ripples in spacetime. They {{should not be confused with}} the gravity waves of fluid dynamics, which are a different concept.|$|E
5|$|In times past, bright comets often {{inspired}} {{panic and}} hysteria {{in the general}} population, being <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> bad omens. More recently, during the passage of Halley's Comet in 1910, the Earth passed through the comet's tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired a fear that cyanogen in the tail might poison millions, whereas the appearance of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult.|$|E

5|$|Later work, {{during the}} 1750s and 1760s, was {{undertaken}} by the landscape gardener Capability Brown.

5|$|Perceptions of {{bird species}} vary across cultures. Owls are {{associated}} with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in Scandinavia. In heraldry, birds, especially eagles, often appear in coats of arms.|$|E
5|$|Since many tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.|$|E
50|$|Kahlo and Casasola are {{considered}} {{the two most important}} photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> himself <b>as</b> an artist—especially not Casasolas—who <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> himself <b>as</b> a historian in the Positivist tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.|$|R

5|$|Some of them, such as Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris, were heralded in {{the popular}} press as the tenth planet, failing to receive {{widespread}} scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object then <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.|$|E
5|$|The 1897–8 {{season at}} Newport saw the {{beginning}} of a 'historic' partnership at half-back between Phillips and Llewellyn Lloyd that lasted till 1901. Phillips and Lloyd were <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a pair, both playing along similar lines and sharing the work of scrum-half and outside-half. While Lloyd was a smarter runner, Phillips was a better kick, but both of them could drop goals, and were remarkable in their kicks to touch.|$|E
5|$|The {{desert is}} {{generally}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a barren and empty landscape.

5|$|The other {{significant}} {{difference is that}} the Lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> “saints” in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E
5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> culinary plants, {{but in the}} traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, thyme, southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, sweet woodruff, and lavender.|$|E
5|$|Venture kept to {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though {{since many of the}} competitors lasted for only one or two issues, Venture can be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.|$|E
