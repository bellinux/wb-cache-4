5|$|Aberdeen's {{first and}} only foreign manager, Ebbe Skovdahl, was {{appointed}} in 1999 and his time in charge coincided {{with some of the}} heaviest defeats in the club's history. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of the club's history came in the 1999–2000 season, where they finished bottom of the table. As the Scottish Premier League was being expanded to twelve teams, there was then a three team play-off. However, as Falkirk's stadium did not meet SPL requirements, Aberdeen retained their status in the top flight. This was followed by an early-season defeat to Ireland's Bohemian F.C. on the away goals rule in the next season's UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of his campaign.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a man would have received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of her poetic career.|$|E

5|$|Calgary rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs for the next four seasons, {{including}} two consecutive division titles. However, they were knocked out {{in the first round of}} the playoffs each time. The 1994 and 1995 Division titles led to Game 7 overtime home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks and San Jose Sharks respectively. In the 1995–96 season, Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in a deal that acquired Jarome Iginla. Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason during which the Flames again lost in the first round, a four-game sweep by the Blackhawks. In 1997, only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> came in the 1997–98 season, in which the Flames finished with only 67 points, the second-lowest point total in franchise history (behind only the 1972-73 Atlanta Flames).|$|E
5|$|The Fujiwhara {{interaction}} had {{a significant}} impact on the track of Humberto, which made a quick turn to the northwest, and then to the north-northwest, early on August 25. The interaction came to an end that afternoon as Humberto completed the northerly turn, while remaining a Category2 hurricane in the tropical waters of the central Atlantic. It began to gradually weaken on August 26 due to an increase in southwesterly shear from a nearby upper-level low as it maintained a north-northwest track. The slow weakening trend continued into August 27 as the eye became intermittent in the moderate-shear environment, which was once again affected by the outflow of Iris to the southwest. That evening, it dropped to a minimal hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds, which was later confirmed to have been <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>point.</b> Operationally, Humberto was downgraded to a tropical storm for a while on August 28, but was later confirmed to have been underestimated. As it tracked away from Iris and into a more open environment, it turned more to the north-northeast and slowly re-intensified again on August 29. Its movement was now affected by an incoming mid-latitude trough that turned Humberto northeast early on August 30. Humberto reached its second intensity peak of 90mph (145km/h) at that time.|$|E

25|$|Aerobraking {{allows a}} {{spacecraft}} {{to reduce the}} high point of an elliptical orbit by repeated brushes with the atmosphere at <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of the orbit. This can save a considerable amount of fuel because it takes much less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits, heating is comparatively minor, and a heat shield is not required. This has been done on several Mars missions such as Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and at least one Venus mission, Magellan.|$|E
25|$|Keith Harrison and Mary Chapman {{described}} {{strong evidence}} for a lake {{in the eastern part}} of Valles Marineris, especially in Coprates Chasma. It would have had an average depth of only 842m—much shallower than the 5–10km depth of parts of Valles Marineris. Still, its volume of 110,000km3 would be comparable to Earth's Caspian Sea. The main evidence for such a lake is the presence of benches at the level that models show is where the lake level should be. Also, <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in Eos Chasma where water would be expected to overflow is marked by fluvial features. The features look as if the flow came together in a small area and caused significant erosion.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in {{relations}} between Ming China and Japan {{occurred during the}} rule of the great Japanese warlord Hideyoshi, who in 1592 announced he was going to conquer China. In two campaigns (now known collectively as the Imjin War) the Japanese fought with the Korean and Ming armies. Though initially successful, the Japanese forces were pushed back southward after the intervention of Ming China. With the combined strength of Ming and Korean forces on land, and the naval prowess of Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin at sea, the campaign ended in defeat for the Japanese and their armies were forced to withdraw from the Korean peninsula. However, the victory came at relatively large cost to the Ming government's treasury: some 26,000,000 ounces of silver.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 Simpson, William Dietrich and John David Anglin {{discovered}} that some impulsive sun flares produce energetic particles among which Helium-3, a light non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron, {{is at least}} ten times more abundant than Helium-4, a non-radioactive and light isotope of helium. On Earth, Helium-4 is what makes up about 99.986% of the helium here. In 1973 his instruments on Pioneer 10 and 11 indicated a cosmic ray intensity increase of about 1 percent per AU. In 1975 he found that during <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of activity three years prior, the abundance of cosmic ray helium was strangely enhanced at these very low energies, as opposed to it dropping off with declining energies like the protons do, toward zero energy.|$|E
25|$|This was <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of Llywelyn's reign, but {{he quickly}} {{recovered}} his position. The other Welsh princes, who had supported King John against Llywelyn, soon became disillusioned with John's rule and changed sides. Llywelyn formed an alliance with Gwenwynwyn of Powys and the two main rulers of Deheubarth, Maelgwn ap Rhys and Rhys Gryg, and rose against John. They {{had the support of}} Pope Innocent III, who had been engaged in a dispute with John for several years and had placed his kingdom under an interdict. Innocent released Llywelyn, Gwenwynwyn and Maelgwn from all oaths of loyalty to John and lifted the interdict in the territories which they controlled. Llywelyn was able to recover all Gwynedd apart from the castles of Deganwy and Rhuddlan within two months in 1212.|$|E
