2500|$|McCaughey's [...] "No Exit" [...] {{article was}} quickly used by {{conservative}} officials and commentators seeking {{to discredit the}} Clinton plan. Senator Bob Dole, in the Republican Party response to the President's State of the Union, used some of McCaughey's arguments of fewer choices, lower quality, and more government control. Bill Kristol's Project for the Republican Future quickly launched television advertisements featuring quotes from McCaughey's two Wall Street Journal op-ed columns and her The New Republic article.

2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that Bill Clinton {{did not have a}} {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration had no overall plan on al-Qaeda to pass on to the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the {{nomination}} was decided by delegates under the Democratic Party's rules, so the candidates campaigned {{to maximize their}} delegate advantage. If {{the nomination}} were decided by popular vote, they likely would have campaigned differently, in order to run up the vote in populous states like New York and Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{has said that the}} popular vote should have no effect under the current rules: [...] "It’s a delegate race. The way the system works is that the delegates choose the nominee." [...] Obama's chief strategist suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign's focus on the popular vote was a distraction tactic: [...] "When they started off, it was all about delegates.... Now that we have more delegates, it’s all about the popular vote. And if that does not work out, they will probably challenge us to a game of cribbage to choose the nominee." [...] Nevertheless, polls have shown that a plurality of Democrats think superdelegates should consider the popular vote when deciding which candidate to support.|$|E

2500|$|Declared Republican nominees now {{included}} Spencer and K. T. McFarland, {{who was a}} Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs under President Ronald Reagan.

2500|$|The Associated Press reported, [...] "Some {{officials}} said they believed the designations were a stretch—a knee-jerk move in a bureaucracy rife with over-classification."

Toobin writes that [...] "government bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals—in short, {{for a variety of}} motives that {{have little to do with}} national security." [...] Toobin wrote that [...] "It's not only the public who cannot know the extent or content of government secrecy. Realistically, government officials can't know either—and this is Hillary Clinton's problem. Toobin noted that [...] "one of Clinton's potentially classified email exchanges is nothing more than a discussion of a newspaper story about drones" [...] and wrote: [...] "That such a discussion could be classified underlines the absurdity of the current system.

2500|$|While the Clinton {{campaign}} chose {{a strategy}} that emphasized experience, Axelrod helped to craft the Obama campaign's main theme of [...] "change."

[...] "Just over half of [...] Democratic caucus-goers said change was the No. 1 factor they were looking for in a candidate, and 51 percent of those voters chose Barack Obama," [...] said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. [...] "That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton." [...] Axelrod also believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. [...] "For all the talent and the money they had over there," [...] says Axelrod, [...] "they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become."

2500|$|Since leaving Congress in 2003, Barr {{has become}} a vocal {{opponent}} of the Patriot Act and has stated that he voted for it reluctantly and regrets voting for it, only agreeing because the Bush administration promised not to attempt to expand the granted powers or use them for non-terrorism purposes, and the administration agreed to report to Congress on their usage. Barr says that the Bush administration promptly ignored these three promises given to Congress and has used the powers granted from the Patriot Act to further erode {{due process of law}} even in matters unrelated to terrorism. Barr claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration did much of the same thing. In 2005– the year the Patriot Act was due for renewal– Barr helped found an organization called Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, a bipartisan group dedicated to eliminating aspects of the Patriot Act that could potentially affect law-abiding citizens rather than terrorists, and to [...] "restore traditional checks and balances on government power so the country can effectively fight terror without sacrificing the rights of innocent Americans, rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution."

2500|$|The ethics {{agreement}} between the State Department and Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation that was put into force {{at the beginning of}} the secretary's tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during early 2015. A Wall Street Journal report found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended. A Washington Post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the secretary's tenure found a six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became secretary, which was permissible under the agreement, and also one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria in January 2010 for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review but did not. The Post noted that the donation [...] "coincided with a spike" [...] in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record but that during 2010 and 2011 the Department still issued human rights reports critical of Algeria's restrictions on freedom of assembly, women's rights and labor rights that also pointed to instances of extrajudicial killings, corruption, and lack of transparency in the government. A Politico analysis of State Department documents found that the department approved virtually all of Bill Clinton's proposed speaking engagements, even when they lacked sufficient information about the valuation of those talks or links between them and possible subsequent donations to the Clinton Foundation.|$|E
