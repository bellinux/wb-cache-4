The guns were equipped with three different types of shells, an armour-piercing (AP) L/4,4 shell that weighed 330kg (727.5lb) and two high explosive (HE) shells that both weighed 315kg (694.4lb)— an L/4,4 type with a base fuse and an L/4,5 version with a nose fuse. All three types of shells used the same propellant charges: an RPC/38 42.5kg (93.7lb) fore charge and an RPC/38 76.5kg (168.6lb) main charge. They fired these shells at a rate of fire of 3.5rounds per minute.

In other words, regardless of <b>traverse</b> <b>speed,</b> an optimum rotational speed (i.e., 1570  rpm) can be used for welding polyamide sheets.

One area being investigated is combining mechanical rock cutting tools with water jets. In this ‘hybrid’ arrangement, the mass breakage mechanism of a rolling disc cutter or drag pick is coupled with the concentrated energy medium of a high pressure water jet. Research has indicated that the resultant improvements in performance of mechanical cutting tools could be due to the cutting of the rock surface through fracture and erosion thereby ameliorating the rock breakage process of the mechanical cutting tool. Damage by a water jet has been observed even in rock of high strength. This paper outlines a study on the sole use of water jets in cutting rock and the effects of changes in the principal variables of a water jet.
