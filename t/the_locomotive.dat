5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving <b>the</b> <b>locomotive,</b> an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near the centre of <b>the</b> <b>locomotive,</b> was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus {{often referred to as}} an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
5|$|After the C's {{assets were}} {{acquired}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1871, the PRR refurbished and operated <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> a few times for public displays: it was fired up for the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and again for the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in 1883. In 1884 <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> was purchased by the Smithsonian Institution as the museum's first major industrial exhibit.|$|E
5|$|Alan Pegler, {{who first}} saw <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, in 1961 {{received}} £70,000 for his share holding when Northern Rubber {{was sold to}} Pegler's Valves, a company started by his grandfather. When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped, Pegler stepped in and bought it outright, with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He spent {{large amounts of money}} {{over the next few years}} having <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> restored at Doncaster Works as closely as possible to its LNER condition: the smoke deflectors were removed; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney; and the tender was replaced by one of the corridor type with which <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> had run between 1928 and 1936. It was also repainted in LNER livery.|$|E
50|$|After the derailment, {{diesel fuel}} spilled from <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> and ignited, and <b>the</b> <b>locomotives,</b> <b>the</b> baggage car, {{and the day}} coach were engulfed in flames. The two crew members in each of <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were killed.|$|R
50|$|Losman {{was signed}} by <b>the</b> Las Vegas <b>Locomotives</b> of <b>the</b> UFL. He signed with <b>the</b> <b>Locomotives</b> on July 21, 2009. On November 27, 2009, he helped <b>the</b> <b>Locomotives</b> win <b>the</b> inaugural UFL Championship. Losman {{recorded}} 9 touchdowns and two interceptions on 1,193 passing yards for <b>the</b> <b>Locomotives</b> in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Initially <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{worked on}} {{passenger}} trains in Zealand, {{after the opening}} of the Great Belt Fixed Link in 1997 <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were used on services on Funen and Jutland. After the introduction of the IR4 trains <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were mostly used on passenger services.|$|R
5|$|Because of the LNER's {{emphasis}} on using <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> for publicity purposes, and then its eventful preservation history, including two international forays, {{it is one}} of the UK's most recognised locomotives. One of its first film appearances was in the 1929 film The Flying Scotsman, which featured an entire sequence set aboard <b>the</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> was manufactured, as the company has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. <b>The</b> <b>locomotive</b> and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{successful}} appeal run by Steam Railway magazine, {{it was decided}} to re-streamline No. 46229. <b>The</b> <b>locomotive</b> was moved to Tyseley Locomotive Works, for the work to be carried out. The project was completed in 2009, and <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> returned to York in May, now wearing its crimson streamlining and pre-war number 6229.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> arrived unassembled {{aboard the}} brig Ythan in May 1839. Two {{engineers}} arrived with <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> (<b>the</b> Samson, the John Buddle and the Hercules), including George Davidson, who helped build <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> in England and would settle in Nova Scotia {{to work with}} Samson {{for the rest of}} his career. Also accompanying <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> on <b>the</b> journey was John Brown Stubbs (Stobbs), Mr. Hackworth's master mechanic. He too helped build <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> and when <b>the</b> job was complete, he returned to Mr. Hackworth's employ in England. The new railway officially opened with a large celebration on 19 September 1839, although the tracks were not actually completed to the coal pier until May 1840.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were used}} on mixed trains on lines between Paris and Bordeaux, after {{incorporation}} into SNCF <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were used for}} shunting duties.|$|R
500|$|Under Southern ownership, the [...] "Remembrances" [...] were {{originally}} painted in Maunsell's Olive Green livery as seen above, with [...] "Southern" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>locomotive's</b> number on <b>the</b> tender tank. [...] Wartime service under the Southern saw <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> painted in black livery with [...] "Sunshine Yellow" [...] lettering. [...] Numbers allocated to <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were 2327 to 2333. [...] After <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{turned out in}} Bulleid's Southern Railway Malachite Green livery with [...] "Sunshine Yellow" [...] lettering.|$|R
5|$|Following the report, the NRM {{commissioned}} First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently {{review the}} remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations {{on how to}} proceed. In March 2013, the museum announced FCP had determined <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> would {{not return to the}} main line until 2015, and believed the outstanding work should be put out to external tender. On 29 October 2013 the museum announced Riley & Son in Bury as the winning contractor, and the same day <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> was moved to their workshop in order to return it to running condition no earlier than summer 2015. On 29 April 2015, Flying Scotsmans boiler left the National Railway Museum to be reunited with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> at Riley & Son in Bury.|$|E
5|$|In April 1980 <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> again took to {{the rails}} and {{thereafter}} was employed in hauling many enthusiasts' trains. After a substantial overhaul, the Duchess was declared fit in 1990 to continue working on the national network {{and at the same}} time the museum purchased it outright from Butlins. In 1998, however, <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> returned to static display at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, the spare A3 boiler had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son to be completely rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out of the desire to restore <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into a worse state than the spare due to the higher operating pressures <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> had experienced following the up-rating of <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> to 250psi during its last private overhaul. Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 boiler was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive, LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern.|$|E
50|$|The South Devon Railway bought <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> when <b>the</b> {{contract}} {{ended on}} 1 July 1866 {{and took over}} their operation. <b>The</b> Cornwall Railway <b>locomotives</b> were also sold to the South Devon Railway, and further locomotives were provided for the West Cornwall Railway. <b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> were operated as a common fleet throughout the three railways, but <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were separately accounted for by each railway.|$|R
50|$|After the coup, {{the plan}} to build <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> was {{forgotten}} and the factory closed. The original plans, preliminary studies and equipment for <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> was either lost or destroyed while {{the contents of the}} factory was sold for scrap. However, the engines bought for <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were used for Materfer's GAIA <b>locomotives</b> in <b>the</b> 1960s.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> are, since <b>the</b> {{start of}} London Underground's PPP scheme, in the {{ownership}} of TransPlant. <b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> are usually stabled at Lillie Bridge Depot or Ruislip depot.|$|R
5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. <b>The</b> <b>locomotive</b> is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. <b>The</b> <b>locomotive</b> has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding <b>the</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and similarly <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotive</b> Neville in the Thomas and Friends children's {{television}} series {{is based on}} Q1 class No. 33010.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{received}} its official naming ceremony in March 1945, {{although it was}} well over five {{years old at the}} time. Alderman Wiggins-Davies performed the ceremony at the back end of Birmingham New Street Station as <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> was too large to be accommodated within {{the main part of the}} station.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the full}} {{electrification}} of <b>the</b> line <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{returned to normal}} stock duties, in December 1998 <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were rebuilt again and became Class 218 machines once again.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were ordered}} by Evans, Walker and Gooch who were now {{contracted}} to operate <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> for both <b>the</b> railways. They were built by Slaughter, Grüning and Company.|$|R
5000|$|After a short {{introductory}} period <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were chartered for the [...] "Blue Train" [...] {{the government}} chartered train the president Josip Broz Tito used. When not used on presidential train duties, <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> also hauled express trains. <b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> were named: D66-001 was [...] "Dinara", D66-002 [...] "Kozara", and D66-003 [...] "Sutjeska". The names {{were written in}} silver letters on the side walls of engines. In the 1978 <b>the</b> presidential <b>locomotives</b> were replaced by four EMD JT22CW-2.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotive</b> was {{featured}} in the BBC4 documentary Flying Scotsman from the Footplate broadcast on 29 December 2016.|$|E
5|$|The tender {{included}} a corridor connection and tunnel {{through the water}} tank giving access to <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> cab from the train so that the driver and fireman could be changed without stopping the train. The following year <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in <b>the</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind <b>the</b> <b>locomotive.</b> In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were built}} by Frichs with a diesel engine {{produced}} by Burmeister & Wain, while Thrige-Titan delivered the electric equipment. In 1957 <b>the</b> first <b>locomotive,</b> MY 1201, was delivered {{followed by the}} second, MY 1202, in 1960. Due to the curved forms of <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> <b>the</b> first <b>locomotive</b> was named Marilyn Monroe. The production of the second experienced severe delays and was named My Fair Lady after the opera which also premiered at the time after numerous delays. <b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> were unstable and error-prone and spent longer being serviced than in operation. They were in operation until 1969 after which they were retired in 1969 and scrapped in 1971.|$|R
50|$|After the war, the {{colliery}} {{line and}} <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> were purchased by <b>the</b> CGR. <b>The</b> <b>locomotives</b> were designated CGR 3rd Class and were renumbered {{in the range}} from 50 to 53.|$|R
50|$|All <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were named}} after capes in Malaysia. In {{the first decade}} of {{operations}} <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> proved more reliable than the Malaysian Class 29 locomotives bought at around the same time.|$|R
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> footplate.|$|E
5|$|Before {{applying}} the top coats of paint, the LMS would apply a matt undercoat of shop grey {{in which it}} was customary to photograph <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was {{in need of}} major improvements. Before preservation, the station had {{contained}} only a fan of sidings, which meant {{that there was no way}} for <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where <b>the</b> <b>locomotive</b> could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A loop was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of repairs to <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{are carried out}} at the Coonoor shed but many of <b>the</b> steam <b>locomotives</b> have been rebuilt at the Golden Rock Workshops. Carriages are repaired at Mettupalayam but, like <b>the</b> <b>locomotives,</b> are taken {{to one of the}} big railway workshops for major work.|$|R
50|$|In December 1996, Tranz Rail {{sold the}} DFT class to the General American Transportation Corporation (GATX, an American {{locomotive}} and rolling stock leasing company) for $131.5 million. It then leased <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{back for a}} period of 12 years. The lease ended on 19 December 2008 with ownership of <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> going to Tranz Rail's successor, KiwiRail, which paid a further $36.6m to buy <b>the</b> <b>locomotives</b> back.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 Shipp {{remained}} with <b>the</b> <b>Locomotives</b> {{for a third}} season, despite the UFL's continued financial problems. In only a four team league, <b>the</b> <b>Locomotives</b> went 3-1 with Shipp as their leading rusher. Shipp gained 164 yards on 49 carries and scored two touchdowns. <b>The</b> <b>Locomotives</b> did not win their third straight championship as they lost in the title game 17-3 to the Virginia Destroyers.|$|R
