5|$|Derived {{from early}} Slavic flag-like objects, a royal banner of arms dates {{as far back}} as the 11th century CE. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. In the interwar period, it was {{replaced}} with <b>the</b> <b>Banner</b> of the Republic of Poland, which was part of the presidential insignia. A national banner is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today's presidential jack is based directly on the pre-war design for <b>the</b> <b>Banner</b> of the Republic.|$|E

Officially abandoned in 1955, <b>the</b> <b>banner</b> continued to be used in practice by the prime minister and, during the 1960s, by the Council of State, a collective head of state of the time.|$|E

This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister Tarō Asō, saying this act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that <b>the</b> <b>banner</b> was not the Hinomaru and should not be regarded as such.|$|E
