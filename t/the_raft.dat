5|$|Today, {{a bronze}} {{bas-relief}} of <b>The</b> <b>Raft</b> of the Medusa by Antoine Étex adorns Géricault's grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rafts</b> were {{fastened}} {{together into}} units called [...] "drams" [...] {{that could be}} as large as one-half mile in length. In the early timber days, <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> were powered either by sail or by the men using long oars known as [...] "sweeps". The men, usually French-Canadians, would guide <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> through <b>the</b> currents of the St. Lawrence to Quebec, a trip that could last over a month. Later, <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> would be guided by tug-boats.|$|R

The fishermen were trained in the selection and preparation of material and fabrication Of <b>the</b> <b>rafts,</b> floating and mooring <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> at sea, location and collection of seed of the required Size, cleaning the seed and seeding the ropes, suspending seeded ropes from <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> and maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>Rafts</b> at sea including periodical cleaning of the ropes to remove epifauna and fouling organisms...|$|R
50|$|The {{expedition}} {{built and}} sailed two balsawood rafts: Rahiti Tane and Tupac Yupanqui. <b>The</b> <b>rafts</b> {{were similar to}} <b>the</b> Kon-Tiki <b>raft</b> built by Thor Heyerdahl in 1947. Like the Kon-Tiki, Rahiti Tane and Tupac Yupanqui were built from balsawood transported from Ecuador to SIMA, the Peruvian Army's shipyard in Callao, Lima. However, <b>the</b> Kon-Tiki2 <b>rafts</b> were different in several respects: Kon-Tiki had a rudder, while <b>the</b> Kon-Tiki2 <b>rafts</b> were steered by guara boards which allowed <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> to be sailed in crosswinds. <b>The</b> Kon-Tiki2 <b>rafts</b> had modern satellite equipment on board, in addition to solar panels and scientific equipment.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{sculptor}} John Connell, in his Raft Project, a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated <b>The</b> <b>Raft</b> of the Medusa by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and tar and placing {{them on a}} large wooden raft.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on <b>the</b> <b>raft.</b> Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for <b>The</b> <b>Raft</b> of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Stark {{provides}} Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces {{that allow}} him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of <b>the</b> <b>Raft.</b> In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker tests a new gadget built by Stark.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is {{hesitant}} {{at his new}} job of distributing food {{found in}} the newly discovered Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> sent by them for rescue may have not {{gone as far as}} they hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the tail section of the plane..|$|E
5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen {{points out}} that the {{painting}} depicts more figures than had been on <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> was {{attacked}} and {{destroyed by the}} Others, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) surfaces in the ocean. Michael is heard screaming for Walt repeatedly, and Sawyer screams for Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). Sawyer decides to rescue Michael first, and swims over to him, dragging him onto a piece of flotsam and performing CPR. Michael then wakes up, and blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, the two notice a shark is encircling them; Michael believes the shark was attracted to Sawyer's bleeding wound, and the two have continuous arguments.|$|E
50|$|Rafting {{became less}} {{important}} after {{the construction of}} the Murg Valley Railway. In 1896, <b>the</b> last <b>raft</b> floated down <b>the</b> River Murg. In 1913 <b>the</b> <b>rafting</b> company closed and was officially banned in 1923.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> River <b>Rafting</b> is {{an annual}} event {{organized}} by the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students, UTN. <b>The</b> <b>Rafting</b> takes place on the Fyris River {{on the last day}} of April as it has done since the first organized version of the event in 1975. <b>The</b> main <b>rafting</b> event is preceded by the weeklong “River Festival”.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>rafts</b> {{remained}} {{close together}} for a while, but as the current quickened and was more skillfully taken advantage of by Jeff, <b>the</b> larger <b>raft</b> gained considerable headway, gradually widening {{the gap between the}} two.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>The</b> <b>Raft</b> of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E
5|$|Eisenberg {{will play}} the famous mime Marcel Marceau in Resistance, {{directed}} and written by Jonathan Jakubowicz. It will focus on Marceau's part in the French resistance during World War II. He will also join Pierce Brosnan and Vanessa Redgrave in a film {{based on the book}} The Wreck of Medusa about the painting <b>The</b> <b>Raft</b> of the Medusa as artist Théodore Géricault. Alongside Alexander Skarsgard, Eisenberg will star as a high-frequency trader in Kim Nguyen's tech drama The Hummingbird Project. Eisenberg joined Riley Stearns's dark action-comedy The Art of Self-Defense alongside Imogen Poots and Alessandro Nivola. Principal photography began in Louisville, Kentucky on Septemberg 11, 2017.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked with}} Corréard, Savigny {{and another of}} the survivors, the {{carpenter}} Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of <b>the</b> <b>raft,</b> which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of planks. Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast {{on a number of}} occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the English Channel.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCell-membrane raft microdomains are {{important}} for successful infection by several viruses. However, {{their role in the}} cell-entry process of human herpesvirus- 6 (HHV- 6) is unknown. Here we tested whether HHV- 6 requires cell-membrane rafts for its entry. When cell-membrane rafts were disrupted by cholesterol depletion, target-cell entry by HHV- 6 was inhibited, although the virus bound normally to the cells. HHV- 6 infectivity was partially rescued by adding exogenous cholesterol. Interestingly, the HHV- 6 cellular receptor, CD 46, was found in <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> after virus attachment, but not in <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> of uninfected cells, indicating that HHV- 6 infection induces the re-location of its receptor into <b>the</b> <b>rafts.</b> Furthermore, glycoprotein Q 1, part of a viral glycoprotein complex that binds CD 46, was also associated with rafts immediately after infection. These data suggest that cellular-membrane lipid rafts {{are important}} in viral entry and that HHV- 6 may enter the target cells via <b>the</b> <b>rafts...</b>|$|R
50|$|Size {{and cargo}} capacity. An {{engineering}} {{study concluded that}} ocean going rafts ranged in size from 6 m to 11 m long and had a cargo capacity of 10 to 30 tons. The cargo capacity of <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> declined as <b>the</b> balsa logs absorbed sea water. After 4 months in the water the capacity of <b>the</b> largest <b>rafts</b> declined to 10 tons and after 8 months to 5 tons. Thus, {{a little more than}} 8 months in the water was the useful life of <b>the</b> <b>rafts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the bottle}} of {{messages}} from <b>the</b> <b>raft,</b> on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore. Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the bottle on the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E
5|$|The central mass of <b>the</b> <b>Raft</b> River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist {{on the southern}} slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|After the New Avengers {{are forced}} to allow Osborn to capture Luke Cage when he needs medical treatment, the team uses a {{tracking}} device Osborn had planted in Cage to trick him into blowing up his own house, after rescuing Cage from Osborn's custody. Osborn then creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming it poses a national security threat. During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Sentry causes Thor's world to fall to Earth. In the middle of Osborn's fight with Captain America, Stark removes Osborn's armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams {{that they do not}} know what they have done, only for Spider-Man to knock him down. He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released. Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in <b>The</b> <b>Raft</b> penitentiary, he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{kinetics}} of the directional coarsening of the gamma-prime precipitates in Ni- 5. 8 Al- 14. 6 Mo- 6. 2 Ta single crystals during creep at 982 C. In this alloy, which is characterized by a large negative lattice misfit between the gamma-prime precipitate and the gamma matrix, the formation of gamma-prime rafts begins during primary creep, and <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> grow in length as the deformation proceeds into steady-state creep. After that, the length of <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> stabilizes. <b>The</b> thickness of <b>the</b> <b>rafts</b> remains constant from primary up to tertiary creep. The directional coarsening behavior of the alloy studied {{is similar to that of}} a more conventional single-crystal superalloy having a substantially smaller negative misfit...|$|R

5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed {{to get back to the}} surface, he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of <b>the</b> <b>raft.</b> He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of {{the flesh of the}} dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E
5|$|Although Bart {{initially}} {{intends to}} drop out of the group as soon as possible, he decides to attend a meeting to avoid a pop quiz at school. Bart dislikes the first meeting, but when he finds out that he gets to have a pocket knife, he decides to keep attending. After a while, Bart starts to enjoy being a member of the Junior Campers, which Homer mocks him relentlessly for. When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to go together but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so. Homer does not enjoy the experience, especially when he learns that he and Bart have to share a raft with Ned and his son, Rod. Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the wrong turn and find themselves lost at sea. They stay stranded with no food or water for several days, as no rescue is forthcoming; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because the Coast Guard boat they were using is out of refreshments. After several other failed attempts at being rescued or finding food, <b>the</b> <b>raft</b> springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but then Homer smells his way to a Krusty Burger on an off-shore oil rig. They are saved, and Bart is proud of his father.|$|E
