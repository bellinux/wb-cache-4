5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

30|$|Parametric {{estimates}} of ATT {{suggest that the}} children of female participants benefit significantly more from the program than the children of male participants. Although not statistically significant, these estimates also suggest <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> benefit more from the program than older children in terms of school attendance. This would be expected if families value education more for <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> than {{for children who are}} approaching working age. Similarly, the parametric estimates suggest that boys benefit more from the program than girls and <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> benefit more than older children; the latter is what would be expected if there is more of a social stigma to sending <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> into the labor force.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, {{contrary}} to the expectation of the family life cycle theory, studies have also shown <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> <b>children</b> have a more positive impact on marriage stability than older ones (Waite & Lillard, 1991; Heaton, 1990; Xu et al. 2013). A possible explanation is <b>that</b> looking after <b>young</b> <b>children</b> demands more time and energy from parents, so {{the husband and wife}} can maximize their contribution through labor division. What is more, parents may also believe that divorce poses greater harm to <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> so parents may be more reluctant to divorce when their <b>children</b> are <b>young.</b>|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} this {{experiment}} several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, Nardini et al. (2010) {{recently}} hypothesised <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> have optimized their sensory {{appreciation for}} speed over accuracy. When information {{is presented in}} two forms, children may derive an estimate from the fastest available source, subsequently ignoring the alternate, even if it contains redundant information. Nardini et al. (2010) provides evidence that children's (aged 6 years) response latencies are significantly lower when stimuli are presented in multi-cue over single-cue conditions. Conversely, adults showed no change between these conditions. Indeed, adults display mandatory fusion of signals, therefore they can only ever aim for maximum accuracy. Interestingly, however, the overall mean latencies for children were not faster than adults, which suggests that speed optimization merely enable them {{to keep up with the}} mature pace. Considering the haste of real-world events, this strategy may prove necessary to counteract the general slower processing of children and maintain effective vision-action coupling. Ultimately the developing sensory system may preferentially adapt for different goals – speed and detecting sensory conflicts – those typical of objective learning.|$|E

The school-attendance regression also suggests that the impact of participation on schooling is larger for male children and possibly for the children of male applicants.|$|R
25|$|Evidence from {{a series}} of four {{experiments}} conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests that children are able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located {{in the middle of the}} sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.|$|E
500|$|The {{creators of}} Sesame Street {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> were easily distracted by peripheral details and {{were unable to}} selectively attend to the most useful aspects of what they observed, so they gave special care to, as Lesser put it, [...] "make salient what the child is expected to learn". [...] They eliminated irrelevant and distracting content without making the content uninteresting, especially in repeated viewings. The content they presented had {{to compete with the}} distractions that occurred as a result of viewing at home, so they realized that the show had to have high appeal. They found, however, that the relationship between appeal and comprehension was more complicated than they initially thought, and discovered <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> probably did not attend to material that was presented at a higher level than they were ready to understand. [...] The Workshop's researchers found that by crafting the show's segments, children's verbal participation and interaction could be increased, which addressed their critics' concerns about children's passivity while watching television.|$|E
500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E

500|$|The show {{revolves}} around the adventures of three kindergarten aged girls with superpowers: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls {{have to deal with}} the normal issues <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode [...] "Meet the Beat Alls," [...] which is an homage to the Beatles).

500|$|From {{its first}} episode, Sesame Street has {{structured}} its format by using [...] "a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music," [...] {{as well as}} animation and live-action short films. When Sesame Street premiered, most researchers believed <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> did not have long attention spans, therefore the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention. At first, the show's [...] "street scenes"—the action taking place on its set—consisted of character-driven interactions and were not written as ongoing stories. Instead, they consisted of individual, curriculum-based segments which were interrupted by [...] "inserts" [...] consisting of puppet sketches, short films, and animations. This structure allowed the producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary the show's pace. By season 20, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.|$|E

500|$|The Wiggles {{have written}} new music each year since their inception; they sequestered {{themselves}} for a month each summer and wrote three albums' worth of original children's music based on simple concepts familiar to young children, and using several genres of music and types of instruments. Most of their songs were short and started with the chorus because they felt <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> needed to be presented with a song's topic in their first few lines. [...] They wrote songs individually at first, but eventually wrote as a group, often with John Field, trumpet player Dominic Lindsay, and Paddick. [...] Fatt, {{the only member of}} the original group without a degree in early childhood education, tended to focus on composing music. [...] Fatt told reporter Brian McElhiney, who called the group's songwriting process [...] "a collaborate affair", that they wrote repetitive pop songs or jingles, which were appealing to children.

500|$|Josh Selig was {{inspired}} to create the show after watching puppeteers perform with their bare hands {{on the set of}} Ulica Sezamkowa in Warsaw, Poland. He noted the amount of expression conveyed by the more skilled actors' hands. Selig pitched the show to Noggin under the working title Pipo, but it was later renamed Oobi to mirror the characters' eyes with two O's. Viacom registered the Oobi title as a trademark on July 5, 2000. Elements of the series were intentionally made simple and old-fashioned, so <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> could easily understand the storylines and relate to the characters. In an interview with Gothamist, Selig stated, [...] "Simple is good. Everything about Oobi is stripped down to the bare essentials: the writing, the puppets, the educational goals. What is left—when it all works—are clear stories and emotional performances unencumbered by lots of fur or feathers." [...] He expanded upon this idea in an article for The New York Times, in which he noted that [...] "in the same way the puppets are very bare, the way they speak is quite distilled ... we've found it's really attractive to young kids. They like the clarity and simplicity." [...] The show was also specifically created to encourage preschool-aged viewers to use their imaginations and play with their own Oobi puppets.|$|E
