5|$|Florida State University has {{a nationally}} {{recognized}} honors program. The University Honors Office supports the university's long tradition of academic excellence by offering two programs, the University Honors Program and <b>the</b> <b>Honors</b> in the Major Program, which highlight the institution's strengths in teaching, research, and community service. <b>The</b> <b>Honors</b> Program also offers special scholarships, internships, research, and study abroad opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{received}} all of <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> previously {{accorded to}} the 45th Infantry Division, including its campaign streamers, which give credit {{for participation in}} combat. Additionally, several of these streamers contain the Arrowhead device, signifying the division's participation in amphibious assaults.|$|E
5|$|Admission {{into the}} University Honors Program is by {{invitation}} only. The average academic profile of students that were offered honors invitations in 2015 was as follows: 4.2 weighted GPA; 32 ACT composite; 2080 SAT total. For <b>the</b> <b>Honors</b> in the Major Program students, the University Honors Office requires that prospective students {{have at least}} sixty semester hours {{and at least a}} 3.2 cumulative FSU GPA. <b>The</b> <b>Honors</b> program offers students housing in Landis Hall and Gilchrist Hall. Landis Hall is the traditional home of Honors students since 1955, which is situated on Landis Green at the heart of FSU's main campus. Gilchrist Hall also houses Honors students and is conveniently located adjacent to Landis Hall. The two halls enjoy a shared study which allows Honors students living in either residence hall to easily gather with classmates and friends.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>honor</b> {{was subject}} to the {{approval}} of <b>the</b> <b>honored,</b> who could decline it. Tiberius did so and Nero did so when first offered <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> during <b>the</b> first year of his reign, {{on account of his}} youth, though he later accepted when <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> was conferred on him for a second time. It was traditional for <b>the</b> <b>honored,</b> in a proper sign of humility, to defer <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> for some time once conferred. Hadrian deferred for eleven years, for example.|$|R

25|$|Vanderbilt {{students}} are required to sign an Honor Code, agreeing to conform to a certain set of behaviors. <b>The</b> <b>honor</b> code dates to 1875. <b>The</b> <b>Honor</b> Committee, later renamed <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Council, was created in 1900. <b>The</b> <b>Honor</b> Council comprises a student executive board and representatives from each class year; it enforces <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Code and informs members of the Vanderbilt community about <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> System. Violations can lead to discipline or expulsion from the university. In 2009, a student sued the university over his expulsion.|$|R
5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled after those of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and not just at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his natural father were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Early in the season, Damian Saunders {{was named}} Atlantic 10 (A-10) {{player of the}} week for two {{consecutive}} weeks, sharing <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> with Chris Wright of Dayton and Jordan Crawford of Xavier, respectively.

5|$|After 1994, {{when the}} American musicians Curtis Mayfield and Frank Sinatra were both issued Grammy Legend Awards, <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> {{have been given}} to {{recording}} artists intermittently. Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti was the 1998 recipient of the award. The following year, British singer-songwriter Elton John was recognized with the honor. The Bee Gees became the first recipients of the award in the 21st century when the brothers were acknowledged by the Grammys in 2003. Overall, fourteen solo musicians and one band have received the Grammy Legend Award.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation:	Exploring the Relationship Between Moral Reasoning and Students' Understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Code at <b>the</b> University of Maryland 		Andrea Corradini Goodwin, Doctor of Philosophy, 2007 Dissertation Directed By:	Jeffrey F. Milem, Ph. D. 		Department of Education Policy and Leadership This mixed methods study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} moral reasoning and students' understanding of <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code at <b>the</b> University of Maryland. The Defining Issues Test, version 2 (DIT 2) was administered to 400 students residing in University housing {{in order to assess}} students' level of moral reasoning. Based on their scores on the DIT 2, students were divided into three groups; those who scored high, medium, and low. Fifteen students were purposefully selected to participate in qualitative interviews to explore their understanding of <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code. Data from the individual interviews illustrated that students understood <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code in various ways including how they made meaning of <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code, how they interpreted <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code, and their attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code. Specifically students at the highest level of moral reasoning believed that <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code was common sense and therefore did not differentiate between <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code and <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> pledge because <b>the</b> principle of academic dishonesty is evident in both. Students who scored {{in the middle of the}} other two groups believed that students' behavior was influenced by their values and judged the morality of actions by comparing their actions to actions that were socially acceptable. They focused on the importance of following <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code because of its importance to the community. Finally, students who scored lowest on the DIT 2 believed that <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code was necessary so that students would not cheat. The meaning they made of <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code was based on <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code as a set of rules. They defined right behavior, in this case following <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code, by what was in their own best interest. Students' attitudes toward cheating also emerged as a result of the analysis of the interview with students. Despite the differences found between students in this study, there were several findings that were consistent across all three groups of students. Students in the study had a favorable attitude toward <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code and reported that they did not engage in academic dishonesty while in college. However, students in all three groups reported that they did not believe that <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code directly impacted their behavior or the behavior of their peers at the University. They believed that faculty and peer behavior were more influential in their decisions regarding academic integrity than <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code. Students in the study were reluctant to report their peers for academic dishonesty and many of the students focused on the importance of grades...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Honor</b> System {{has been}} {{run by the}} student body since 1905 and is derived from Robert E. Lee during his tenure as President of the University. Any student found guilty of an Honor Violation {{by his or her}} peers is subject to a single penalty: expulsion. <b>The</b> <b>Honor</b> System is defined and {{administered}} solely by students, and there is no higher review. A formal review, occasionally including referenda, is held every three years to refine the tenets of <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> System. Students continue to support <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> System and its single penalty overwhelmingly, and alumni regularly point to <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> System as one of the distinctive marks they carry with them from their W experience. W Law students enjoy several distinct benefits from <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> System. These include more freedom in exam taking as well as an informal account system at the Brief Stop cafeteria in Sydney Lewis Hall. These are balanced by the strict penalty of a violation of <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> System.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|Fordham's {{undergraduate}} schools all offer honors {{programs for}} their students. The programs' curricula are modified {{versions of the}} Core Curriculum. For example, the Fordham College Honors Program offers a Great Books curriculum with seminar-style classes and a senior research thesis in each student's major. Most honors students are inducted into the programs upon admission to the university, though some are invited {{at the end of}} their first year. Each program has a designated study space for its members, including Alpha House for the Fordham College Honors Program and <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> wing of Hughes Hall for the Global Business Honors Program. Upon graduating from the university, honors students receive the designation of in cursu honorum on their diploma and transcripts.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> University <b>Honor</b> Code {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cherished}} traditions since the university's inception. <b>The</b> <b>Honor</b> Code states that [...] "I will not lie, cheat, or steal" [...] along with a number of amended premises such as a toleration clause for academic offenses (it is a violation of <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Code to not report cheating), and other specifics meant to guide the student body. Each new student entering the university must sign <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Code at a formal service in All Saints Chapel. <b>The</b> <b>Honor</b> Code and System is administered by a student-run, student-elected <b>Honor</b> Council. Only <b>the</b> Vice-Chancellor (President of the University) may overturn a decision through an appeals process. Although <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Council was once governed by the Order of Gownsmen, <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Council is now an independent body, whose procedures and rules are the sole governance.

5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied <b>the</b> <b>honors</b> of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Honor</b> Code {{itself was}} created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of {{cheating}} and academic dishonesty. Ernest L.

This led to <b>the</b> <b>Honor</b> Code today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol. A signed commitment to live <b>the</b> <b>honor</b> code {{is part of the}} application process and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff.
