50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800's,</b> <b>the</b> area {{prior to}} the {{formation}} as a village, was an outspan area for resting team-animals transporting goods across the region mainly due to {{the water of the}} small lakes dotting the area. Modern Ermelo was founded by Dutch Reformed Church Reverend Frans Lion Cachet (1835-1899). He would minister to the many farms in the area. A congregation was started by Cachet in 1870, and was recognised by the 5th annual general meeting of the church in April 1872.|$|R
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{terms in}} English {{used to describe}} the weather systems generated by highs and lows were introduced in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s,</b> mostly by the British. The scientific theories which explain the general phenomena originated about two centuries earlier.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{was named}} Goodison Park because {{the length of}} the site was built against Goodison Road.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Vallahades, many Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks who settled in Greek Macedonia following the population exchanges were generally fluent in Turkish, which they had used as their second language for hundreds of years. However, unlike the Vallahades, these Greek communities from northeastern Anatolia and the former Russian South Caucasus had generally either remained Christian Orthodox throughout the centuries of Ottoman rule or had reverted to Christian Orthodoxy in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800,</b> after having superficially adopted Islam in the 1500s whilst remaining Crypto-Christians.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{early to}} <b>mid-1800s</b> <b>the</b> area around Hanging Rock was a loading dock for steamboats on the Wabash River.

5|$|The Iroquois and Delaware Indians {{were the}} first {{inhabitants}} of the Kettle Creek watershed. The first European settler arrived in 1794 and with more settlers arriving in the following decades. The coal mining industry began in the watershed in 1874 and lasted until the 1970s. The lumbering industry lasted from <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s</b> to around 1910. Natural gas was also extracted in the watershed in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Tirunelveli is {{also known}} for halwa, a sweet made of wheat, sugar and ghee. It {{originated}} during <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s</b> at Lakshmi Vilas Stores, which still exist.

5|$|Prior to 1921, {{the upper}} Colorado River above the {{confluence}} with the Green River in Utah had assumed various names. Fathers Dominguez and Escalante named it Rio San Rafael in 1776. Through <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s,</b> the river between Green River and the Gunnison River was most {{commonly known as}} the Grand River. The river above the junction with the Gunnison River, however, was known variously as the Bunkara River, the North Fork of the Grand River, the Blue River, and the Grand River. The latter name did not become consistently applied until the 1870s.|$|E

25|$|During the Restoration era (February 1665 – August 1714) a soap tax was {{introduced}} in England, which meant that until <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800's,</b> soap was a luxury, used regularly only by the well-to-do. The soap manufacturing process was closely supervised by revenue officials who made sure that soapmakers' equipment was kept {{under lock and key}} when not being supervised. Moreover, soap could not be produced by small makers because of a law which stipulated that soap boilers must manufacture a minimum quantity of one imperial ton at each boiling, which placed the process beyond reach of the average person. The soap trade was boosted and deregulated when the tax was repealed in 1853.|$|R

5|$|Native Americans {{settled in}} the Solomon Creek {{watershed}} by approximately 8000 B.C. to 6000 B.C. Ebenezer Hibbard was an early European settler on the creek, living there by 1772. The creek is named after a person with the surname of Solomon, who settled {{at the mouth of}} the creek in 1774. In the early 1800s, Europeans first realized the natural resources of the watershed. In the early 1800s, there was a tavern called Inman's Tavern and several cabins in the Solomon Gap. In <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s,</b> the population of the watershed increased significantly due to coal mining and timbering opportunities. The first road in Fairview Township, the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Turnpike, started at Solomon Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the wrens {{increased}} northward and westward in several regions {{over the past few}} centuries. In Massachusetts, the wrens had expanded westward and northeastward from its former southeastern location in approximately 35 years, in New York the population increased three-fold in roughly 25 years, while in midwest states such as Ohio and Michigan have seen numbers of the birds increase since <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s</b> and early 1900s, respectively. Expansion around Ontario occurred since early reports in 1890 and 1905. Explanations given include infrequent winter storms in the 20th century, expanded forest habitats, and the wrens taking advantage of urban areas containing feeders, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} PA848 {{began as an}} {{alignment}} of the Cochecton and Great Bend Turnpike (a portion of the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike), a19th Century turnpike built from Great Bend, Pennsylvania to Newburgh, New York. The road was completed in Pennsylvania in1811, five years after construction began. The turnpike did not fare after <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s,</b> with the road abandoned in 1853. When the modern state highway system for Pennsylvania debuted in1928, the alignment of future PA371 was not included. In1936, PA371 was designated on its alignment from New Milford to the New York state line; however, this would only last sixteen years, as the Pennsylvania Department of Highways truncated PA371 back to the intersection with PA171 in Union Dale, further east in Susquehanna County.|$|E

25|$|The Adventist {{presence}} in Canada {{dates back to}} <b>the</b> early and <b>mid-1800s</b> and <b>the</b> Millerite movement. William Miller, Joshua Himes, and Josiah Litch all helped build the Millerite cause on Canadian soil.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many areas}} in today’s modern cities, the Inner Belt District bears little {{resemblance}} to what the area looked like {{when it was first}} being settled. The area was primarily marshland and the Miller's River, which has since been filled in, flowed along the southern edge. As industry began to enter into the area in <b>the</b> early- to <b>mid-1800s,</b> <b>the</b> landscape was changed to suit the needs of new businesses. Cobble Hill was brought down and used to fill in the marshes. Miller’s River was used first by the new industries to discharge their pollutants, and was eventually filled as well.|$|R
5|$|Several mills {{powered by}} Kettle Creek {{had been built}} by 1852. Logging, {{including}} cutting down hemlock trees, was historically done in the upper Kettle Creek watershed. The main companies doing logging {{in the area in}}cluded the Lackawanna Lumber Company, and Emporium and Goodyear Companies. The lumbering industry in the watershed began in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s.</b> With the arrival of railroads in the area in the late 1800s, the industry became more prevalent. The Lackawanna Lumber Company began working in the area in 1893. By 1900, there were two railroads along the creek used for hauling logs to a sawmill near Cross Fork. However, the lumbering industry collapsed after 1910. The population had peaked around 1900 and numerous residents of the watershed left shortly {{after the collapse of the}} area's lumbering industry. Timber production was done to a limited extent in the northern part of the watershed, as of 2001. The population has remained relatively stable since the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The Bibliothèque {{nationale}} de France (BnF) operates {{public libraries}} in Paris, {{among them the}} François Mitterrand Library, Richelieu Library, Louvois, Opéra Library, and Arsenal Library.

The François Mitterrand Library (nicknamed Très Grande Bibliothèque) in the 13th arrondissement was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} known for its once {{prolific}} runs of anadromous fish, notably Chinook salmon and steelhead, which sustained Native American tribes for thousands of years. Due to its remoteness, the Trinity did not feature prominently in the early European colonization of California, but the gold rush in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s</b> brought thousands of gold seekers to the area. The river was named by Major Pierson B. Reading who, upon reaching the river in 1848, mistakenly believed it to flow into the Pacific Ocean at Trinidad Bay. During and after the gold rush, the influx of settlers and miners into the Trinity River country led to conflict with indigenous tribes, many of which saw severe depopulation due to fighting and foreign diseases. In the following decades logging and ranching, combined with mining runoff, significantly changed the river's ecology and led to the decline of its fish populations.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{frequently}} quarrelled {{with fellow}} inventors and engineering peers over steam technology in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s.</b> His increasing frustration {{led to his}} premature publication {{of what he had}} hoped would be the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide. The Steam Engineer's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach. A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens' contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the Steam Engineer's Guide proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} whole history of wild Murray cod between <b>the</b> <b>mid–1800s</b> and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now grave concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray cod populations.|$|E
5|$|The oldest Sabor with extant records {{was held}} in Zagreb on 19 April 1273. This was the Sabor of Slavonia, and not of Croatia and Dalmatia. The {{earliest}} Sabor of the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia dates to 1351. The Parliament session held in 1527 in Cetin affirmed the House of Habsburg as Croatian rulers. After this, the Sabor became a regular gathering of the nobility, and its official title gradually stabilised by 1558 as the Parliament of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. Since 1681, it has been formally called the Diet of the Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia. In 1712, the Sabor once again invoked its prerogative to select the ruler, supporting what later became the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. Since <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800s,</b> the Sabor has regularly met and its members have been regularly elected. Exercising its sovereignty once again on 29 October 1918, the Sabor decided on independence from Austria-Hungary and formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which later joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Sabor did not meet between 1918 and 1945, except for an unelected Sabor convened in 1942. The Sabor initially reconvened as an assembly of State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) in 1943 and evolved since through various structures following the November 1945 elections and several changes of the constitution. After the first multi-party elections since Communist rule and {{the adoption of the}} 1990 constitution, the Sabor was bicameral (Chamber of Representatives and Chamber of Counties) until 2001, when constitutional amendments changed it to the unicameral form currently used.|$|E
50|$|The Union County Courthouse {{was built}} from 1927 - 28 as a Greek revival by Mann & Stern architects of Little Rock. The {{original}} Union County Courthouse, built in 1844 {{at a cost}} of $200 stood where Larry's Rexall Drug Store is today. As the county seat, El Dorado quickly outgrew even its second courthouse (built on this site in 1848) in the 1920s due to the oil boom's voluminous deed and title transactions. Faceted in smooth-dressed limestone, the third and current courthouse boasts 40 freestanding ionic exterior columns spanning four stories, and a richly detailed marble two-story atrium with art deco accents. The exterior medallions of the scales of justice and lanterns of light signify the search for truth. The building's largest courtroom features a walnut wainscot, painting and scoring on textured plaster walls to resemble stone, and an ornately detailed plaster cast ceiling of gilded rosettes. Back when the square was flanked by log cabin structures there was a large duck pond on this site. Emigrants camped on its banks. Many pioneer citizens recorded incidents where deer and even bears came to drink - and hunters would frequently bag their dinner by shooting the wild ducks that lit there in <b>the</b> <b>mid-1800.</b> It was filled in under contract by Ben Mathews.|$|R
