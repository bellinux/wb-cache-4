5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent maritime engineering firm {{to make a}} survey of the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Hawking and {{co-author}} Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, {{that it is}} reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim however, {{that it is possible to}} answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{definition}} alone {{it is not}} obvious that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given {{a description of a}} Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.|$|E
500|$|The {{second round}} plays {{almost exactly the}} same as the first round; however, the {{questions}} were asked to men who belong to a specific group (e.g., married men, African-American men, or men under the age of 25). Each correct prediction is worth $300. The last question of Round 2 is designated as the [...] "VIP" [...] question, which is focused on one specific group of men and asked to a special guest related to the question. When the VIP question is about a specific man, before the question is asked, the panel is allowed 30 seconds to [...] "interrogate" [...] the VIP about their background, personal preferences, etc., and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is played out as normal, with the VIP giving his answer verbally after the contestants give their prediction. Actor Ted Lange (most well known for his role on The Love Boat) appeared in some episodes as the show's bartender and was often the man who was previously asked the VIP question.|$|E

2500|$|The IRA denied {{responsibility}} for the killings at the time. It stated on 17 January 1976:The Irish Republican Army has never initiated sectarian killings, and sectarianism of any kind is abhorrent to the Republican Movement [...] If the loyalist elements responsible for over 300 sectarian assassinations {{in the past four}} years stop such killing now, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of retaliation from whatever source will not arise.|$|E
2500|$|When {{somebody}} commits a {{crime against}} the laws of two different states, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether the states constitute two different sovereigns or just one is determined by whether the state governments [...] "draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power." [...] Answering the question, Justice O'Connor wrote that the [...] "powers" [...] of state governments [...] "to undertake criminal prosecutions derive from separate and independent sources of power and authority originally belonging to them before admission to the Union and preserved {{to them by the}} Tenth Amendment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In similar incidents, the IRA {{deliberately}} killed 91 Protestant {{civilians in}} 1974–76 (CAIN). The IRA did not officially claim the killings, but justified {{them in a}} statement on 17 January 1976, [...] "The Irish Republican Army has never initiated sectarian killings ... if loyalist elements responsible for over 300 sectarian assassinations {{in the past four}} years stop such killing now, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of retaliation from whatever source does not arise". In late 1976, the IRA leadership met with representatives of the loyalist paramilitary groups and agreed to halt random sectarian killings and car bombings of civilian targets. The loyalists revoked the agreement in 1979, after the IRA killing of Lord Mountbatten, but the pact nevertheless halted the cycle of sectarian revenge killings until the late 1980s, when the loyalist groups began killing Catholics again in large numbers.|$|E

2500|$|Lifting covers up the {{definition}} of translation, which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, [...] "Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?" [...] For the rock to be unable {{to move from one}} space to another, {{it would have to be}} larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone became {{concerned}} with the situation of [...] "coal whippers". These were the men who worked on London docks, [...] "whipping" [...] in baskets from ships to barges or wharves all incoming coal from the sea. They were called up and relieved through public-houses and therefore a man could not get this job unless he possessed the favourable opinion of the publican, who looked upon most favourably those who drank. The man's name was written down and the [...] "score" [...] followed. Publicans issued employment solely on {{the capacity of the}} man to pay, and men often left the pub to work drunk. They spent their savings on drink to secure the favourable opinion of publicans and therefore further employment. Gladstone passed the Coal Vendors Act 1843 to set up a central office for employment. When this Act expired in 1856 a Select Committee was appointed by the Lords in 1857 to look into the question. Gladstone gave evidence to the Committee: [...] "I approached the subject in the first instance as I think everyone in Parliament of necessity did, with the strongest possible prejudice against the proposal but the facts stated were of so extraordinary and deplorable a character, {{that it was impossible to}} withhold attention from them. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> being whether legislative interference was required I was at length induced to look at a remedy of an extraordinary character as the only one I thought applicable to the case...it was a great innovation". Looking back in 1883, Gladstone wrote that [...] "In principle, perhaps my Coalwhippers Act of 1843 was the most Socialistic measure of the last half century".|$|E
