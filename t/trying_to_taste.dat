60|$|Thus their {{obscenity}} is {{the expression}} of their passionate love of dragging all things into the light. The avarice of their peasants means the independence of their peasants. What the English call their rudeness in the streets is a phase of their social equality. The worried look of their women is connected with the responsibility of their women; and a certain unconscious brutality of hurry and gesture in the men is related to their inexhaustible and extraordinary military courage. Of all countries, therefore, France is the worst country for a superficial fool to admire. Let a fool hate France: if the fool loves it he will soon be a knave. He will certainly admire it, {{not only for the}} things that are not creditable, but actually for the things that are not there. He will admire the grace and indolence of the most industrious people in the world. He will admire the romance and fantasy of the most determinedly respectable and commonplace people in the world. This mistake the Englishman will make if he admires France too hastily; but the mistake that he makes about France will be slight compared with the mistake that he makes about himself. An Englishman who professes really to like French realistic novels, really to be at home in a French modern theatre, really to experience no shock on first seeing the savage French caricatures, is making a mistake very dangerous for his own sincerity. He is admiring something he does not understand. He is reaping where he has not sown, and taking up where he has not laid down; he is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> the fruit when he has never toiled over the tree. He is trying to pluck the exquisite fruit of French cynicism, when he has never tilled the rude but rich soil of French virtue.|$|E

The present study aimed at determining whether adrenergic transmission at the Insula regulates the reluctance <b>to</b> <b>try</b> novel <b>tastes</b> induced by arousing contexts. To this end, a combination of systemic and intra-insular manipulations of adrenergic activity was performed before the novel taste (saccharin 0. 1 %) was presented either in LA or HA contexts in rats. Our results show that systemic adrenergic activity modulates reluctance <b>to</b> <b>try</b> novel <b>tastes.</b> Moreover, intra-insular microinjections of propranolol or norepinephrine were found to modulate the effects of arousing contexts on reluctance <b>to</b> <b>try</b> novel <b>tastes.</b> Finally, intra-insular propranolol blocked epinephrine-induced increased reluctance, while intra-insular norepinephrine blocked oral propranolol-induced decreases in reluctance and increased the reluctance <b>to</b> <b>try</b> novel <b>tastes</b> presented in low arousing contexts. In conclusion, our {{results suggest that the}} insula is a critical site for regulating the effects of arousal in the reluctance <b>to</b> <b>try</b> novel <b>tastes</b> via the adrenergic system...|$|R
