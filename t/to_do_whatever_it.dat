During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 45). In sports competitions, {{some athletes}} may resort <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> takes <b>to</b> win. One of the illicit methods used by endurance athletes {{to gain an}} advantage is blood doping. These practices are used to raise an athlete's {{red blood cell count}} thus increasing the transportation of oxygen to muscle tissue, resulting higher stamina and performance. Blood transfusion fall into two categories: homologous and autologous. Homologous blood transfusions, where an athlete gets blood from another person, can be detected by flow cytometry. However, autologous blood transfusions, where the transfusions are done by taking the athlete's own blood and refrigerating it until future use, cannot be detected directly. My project has been inspired by this inability to detect autologous blood doping and I am establishing a capillary electrophoresis based method to meet this need. By using capillary electrophoresis, I have developed a method that allows me to distinguish between the clean and doped blood samples. The instrument has numerous advantages over other analytical instruments, including: higher resolution, smaller sample volume requirements, and shorter analysis times. A transfusion can be seen based on the electrophoretic mobility differences of the red blood cells. The difference in the mobility of the cells {{is the result of the}} natural aging process of the red blood cells, as well as storage induced changes. In particular the storage of the red blood cells alters the cells size, leading to the mobility differences that we observe. The mobilities differences are even more apparent in athletes as they have fewer old erythrocytes in circulation. As a result, I was able to correctly identify, in vitro doped blood samples, with as little as a 5...|$|R

500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself and the freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade."

Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> takes to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E
