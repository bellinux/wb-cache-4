40|$|Bachelor thesis called " Louny Gradual by Paul Melnik in 1530 " first {{summarizes}} {{the existing literature}} on the topic, which occurs soon after the half of the 19 th century (Chapter 1). The names of the purchaser and illuminator of <b>the</b> Louny <b>Gradual</b> are documented {{in the first part}} of <b>the</b> <b>Gradual's</b> explicit (IG 8, f. 427 v). The explicit also includes the date and provenance of <b>the</b> Louny <b>Gradual,</b> which was completed in 1530 for Utraquist literary fraternity at St. Nicholas'Church in Louny (Chapter 2. 4). <b>The</b> Louny <b>Gradual</b> belongs among <b>the</b> last written Latin Utraquist choral books.

5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist.

5|$|Appreciation of art {{among the}} gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art practiced by many. Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably shifted from the Northern (960–1127) to Southern Song (1127–1279) periods, influenced in part by <b>the</b> <b>gradual</b> embrace of the Neo-Confucian political ideology at court.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the count focused on two other projects: the first {{grew out of}} his longstanding {{interest}} in promoting literature and sciences, and the second, more ambitious aim was to fight for <b>the</b> <b>gradual</b> abolition of slavery. When in 1867 PedroII openly asked for <b>the</b> <b>gradual</b> eradication of slavery in his Speech from the Throne, Porto Alegre {{was one of the}} few individuals who supported him, sending him a letter of congratulation. On 18 June 1869, the Partenon Literário (Literary Parthenon), a spiritual successor to the Historic and Geographic Institute of the Province of São Pedro, was created and Porto Alegre was made an honorary member. In one of its sessions, the count, who had already embarked on a plan of gradually freeing his own slaves, proposed the creation of a civil association devoted to slavery's abolition. His idea was not only welcomed but came to fruition. The Sociedade Libertadora (Liberation Society) was founded on 29 August, with Porto Alegre as its president, its primary purpose being the purchase of freedom for enslaved children.|$|E
50|$|Like Tracts, most Graduals show clear {{signs of}} centonization, {{a process of}} {{composition}} in which an extended vocabulary of stock musical phrases are woven together. Some phrases are only used for incipits, some only for cadences, and some only {{in the middle of}} a musical line. <b>The</b> Gregorian <b>Graduals</b> can be organized into musical families that share common musical phrases. Although nearly half of <b>the</b> Gregorian <b>Graduals</b> belong to a family of related chants in the fifth mode, the most famous family of Graduals are those of the second mode, commonly called the Iustus ut palma group after one representative chant. <b>The</b> <b>Graduals</b> of <b>the</b> Old Roman chant fall similarly into centonization families, including a family corresponding to the Iustus ut palma group.|$|R

50|$|That {{edition of}} <b>the</b> Roman <b>Gradual</b> was <b>the</b> basis also {{of a more}} general {{compilation}} of chants known as the Liber Usualis.

Solemn Evensong, followed by Benediction or the Rosary, is sung weekly on Saturday evenings.|$|R
