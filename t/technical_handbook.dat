There are things that young people should know, and know fully before {{they are involved in}} the central drama of life, in the serious business of love. There should be no horrifying surprises. Sane, clear, matter-of-fact books setting forth the broad facts of health and life, the existence of certain dangers, should come their way. In this matter books, I would insist, have a supreme value. The printed word may be such a quiet counsellor. It is so impersonal. It can have no conceivable personal reaction with the reader. It does not watch its reader's face, it is itself unobtrusively unabashed and safer than any priest. The power of the book, the possible function of the book in the modern state is still but imperfectly understood. It need not be, it ought not, I think, to be, a book specifically on what one calls delicate questions, that would be throwing them up in just the way one does not want them thrown up; it should be a sort of rationalized and not too <b>technical</b> <b>handbook</b> of physiological instruction in the College Library--or at home.

50|$|Gesso pastiglia {{is mostly}} found in Italy in the 14th to 16th centuries, where pastiglia on larger pieces of {{furniture}} such as cassoni, and on picture frames, {{was more likely to}} be gilded gesso than true white lead pastiglia. Both panel paintings and gilded frames had a thin flat layer of gesso as part of their preparation, to which the pastiglia decoration was added. On furniture and frames the gesso seems sometimes to have been carved from a thicker flat surface in a subtractive technique, and sometimes built up in an additive one, for smaller and larger areas respectively. Another additive technique was to simple pipe the gesso from a bag through a nozzle, like icing a cake, to give long round lines, often used as the tendrills in foliage designs. It was then always gilded or painted, usually the former. The technique was very widely used in painted panels while gold-ground paintings remained the norm for altarpieces, along with a range of other techniques for decorating plain gilded surfaces such as stamping, engraving or scratching lines, and stippling, punching or pricking dots. In Gothic architectural frames for polyptychs, pastiglia is very commonly used to decorate small flat areas such as spandrels and behind scalloped edges. The technique is described {{at the end of the}} <b>technical</b> <b>handbook</b> by Cennino Cennini, whose own paintings made use of it, although he does not use the term himself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: South Africa adopted {{inflation}} targeting in 2000, {{targeting the}} consumer price index (CPI) excluding mortgage interest cost (or CPIX), for “metropolitan and urban areas”. Yet there is no clear technical account of the methodology of construction of CPI and CPIX by Statistics South Africa, as published by reputable government statistical agencies in other countries. This paper has two goals. First, we aim to enhance transparency by explaining the CPI methodology (as we understand it), and to encourage publication of an official <b>technical</b> <b>handbook.</b> We also raise various technical issues concerning CPI construction. Second, we produce estimates of CPIX (“metropolitan areas”) back to 1970, on a consistent methodology, using monthly price indices, the appropriate weights, and linking correctly when rebasing. While the CPIX (“metropolitan and urban areas”) measure only became relevant to monetary policy setting and wage contracts from 2000, and is published monthly only from 1997, a far longer time series is required for the forecasting and modelling exercises of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), National Treasury and others.

40|$|Background Dengue is an {{increasingly}} incident disease across {{many parts of}} the world. In response, an evidence-based handbook to translate research into policy and practice was developed. This handbook facilitates contingency planning as well as the development and use of early warning and response systems for dengue fever epidemics, by identifying decision-making processes that contribute to {{the success or failure of}} dengue surveillance, as well as triggers that initiate effective responses to incipient outbreaks. Methodology/Principal findings Available evidence was evaluated using a step-wise process that included systematic literature reviews, policymaker and stakeholder interviews, a study to assess dengue contingency planning and outbreak management in 10 countries, and a retrospective logistic regression analysis to identify alarm signals for an outbreak warning system using datasets from five dengue endemic countries. Best practices for managing a dengue outbreak are provided for key elements of a dengue contingency plan including timely contingency planning, the importance of a detailed, context-specific dengue contingency plan that clearly distinguishes between routine and outbreak interventions, surveillance systems for outbreak preparedness, outbreak definitions, alert algorithms, managerial capacity, vector control capacity, and clinical management of large caseloads. Additionally, a computer-assisted early warning system, which enables countries to identify and respond to context-specific variables that predict forthcoming dengue outbreaks, has been developed. Conclusions/Significance Most countries do not have comprehensive, detailed contingency plans for dengue outbreaks. Countries tend to rely on intensified vector control as their outbreak response, with minimal focus on integrated management of clinical care, epidemiological, laboratory and vector surveillance, and risk communication. The <b>Technical</b> <b>Handbook</b> for Surveillance, Dengue Outbreak Prediction/ Detection and Outbreak Response seeks to provide countries with evidence-based best practices to justify the declaration of an outbreak and the mobilization of the resources required to implement an effective dengue contingency plan...|$|E
40|$|Volatile (essential) {{oil crops}} yield {{a wide range}} of products: fresh and dried herbs, oils and oil {{components}} and various oleoresins. Changing lifestyles in developed countries have led to a dramatic increase in demand for these products, particularly over the last decade. More varied use has been made of oils and herbs in cooking, and oil components are now being regarded as safe alternatives to synthetic food additives and crop protection substances. The surge in demand for these products has encouraged a number of temperate and Mediterranean countries to evaluate a range of volatile oil-bearing species as alternative crops. This has resulted in a rapid expansion in the scientific and technical literature on culinary and medicinal herbs. Volatile oil crops draws much of this literature together for the first fume. It reviews the basic botany, physiology and biochemistry of the major species and then analyses the genetics of oil composition.

40|$|A solo {{exhibition}} of paintings. From the press release: Exhibition dates: 25 July - 17 October 2015 Preview: Friday 24 July, 6 : 00 - 8 : 00 pm Guest curated by Andrew Hunt The Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art {{is pleased to}} present 'Ringbinder', a {{solo exhibition}} by Jeffrey Dennis, which will consist of {{a new series of}} paintings and sculpture housed in NGCA's reconfigured main gallery space. Aside from staging a concentrated progression of the artist's work made between 2011 and 2015, the exhibition will also attempt to reflect on Dennis' development since his initial profile in Britain was formed during the early 1980 s. This was a period that saw a significant international resurgence in painting in parallel with the 'New Image Painting' in North America and the 'Jungen Wilden' (Young Wild Ones) in Germany, both of which were considered counter-movements to Conceptual Art. As if referencing a synthesis of this historical polarity, Dennis' painting The Artist Successfully Levitating in the Studio (2011) pictures a full-length self-portrait in mid-air surrounded by a plethora of psychedelic bubbles. A reversal of the great conceptual artist Bruce Nauman's Failing to Levitate in My Studio (1966), The Artist Successfully [...] . presents an impossible and affirmative act against (what one might call) certain canonized 'labourer priests of the negative', such as Nauman and Samuel Beckett, in whose work failure's gravity exerts its pull everywhere. In essence, Dennis' minor comic triumph countervails negative forms of motion through a sense of revelatory wonder and aspiration. Other subject matter includes graphic Bengali cinema posters, images from a <b>technical</b> <b>handbook</b> of fixtures and fittings retrieved from a skip in the 1970 s, as well as films such as Jean Luc Godard's self-conscious critique of consumerism Two or Three Things I Know About Her; reference points that provide the artist with the tools for constructing enchanted visual spaces in his strange objects. Surrounded by Dennis' signature painted bubbles - a device originally taken from a scene in Godard's film in which froth on a cup of coffee dissipates - the artist transforms the micro to the macro; a situation in which we travel from foam in a washing-up bowl to different points in inter-galactic space. Dennis has recently developed a number of new three-dimensional objects that act as portable multi-faceted stage sets. Studded with vignetted painted imagery, each 'sculpture' contains a narrative that springs from popular events taken from television, newspapers and his own photographs. Personal and political histories are exemplified in a work that refers to the area of north London in which the artist lives, through the depiction of a flower-monument at the inconspicuous site of the shooting that sparked the nationwide riots of 2011, as well as drawing reference to Tottenham's Broadwater Farm riots twenty-six years earlier in 1985. If during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, Dennis' work was included in significant shows in the UK and US, then his subsequent development has been interestingly awkward, typical of painting's wider expansion since the 1980 s through his unusual, divergent and contradictory subject matter. This exhibition, the painter's largest in the UK for thirty years, will hopefully prove to be significant for the wider discourse currently surrounding painting in the UK and abroad. Jeffrey Dennis was born in Colchester in 1958 and graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art in 1980. Solo exhibitions include Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1986), Orchard Gallery, Derry (with an essay by the late Stuart Morgan), and Salvatore Ala Gallery, New York (both 1993), Anderson O'Day Gallery, London (1994) and Art Space Gallery, London (2008). His work is held in collections worldwide, including the Arts Council Collection; the British Council Collection; Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Paris; The New School Art Collection, New York City; Saatchi Collection, London; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; and Tate, London. Jeffrey Dennis: Ringbinder is organised by the London-based curator Andrew Hunt. A new publication containing commissioned essays and a full catalogue of the artist's recent work will be published by NGCA in 2016.

Richard 'T. Gosser carried a lot of weight in Toledo. He forged alliances with Democratic Party figures and business leaders in Toledo. As a result, he found himself sitting {{on the wrong side of}} the political fence more than once. In his role as labor advocate, Gosser pursued negotiations with the Willys-Overland Corporation, yet maintained cordial relations with its chief officers. Henry J. and Edgar Kaiser. The Gosser Papers, although they cover a range of thirty years, do not fully document Gosser's career. Internal UAW circular letters and Local 12 correspondence, for example, are conspicuously absent. On the other hand, the Local 12 scrapbooks, with clippings largely from Toledo and Detroit general and labor newspapers, do record the public activities of both local and international unions. Other UAW material deals with proposals for union-owned television stations with state political activity 1 and with Gosser’s resignation. The series of international executive board minutes, of the proceedings of the constitutional conventions and the runs of United Auto Worker and Solidarity together form an invaluable. If not unique, source for the union's international activity from 1947 to 1963. Finally, a group of interviews collected about 1963 from tong-time members of Local 12 recount the local's formation and earl y struggles. Related to the UAW material are files from Gosser's service as consultant to the Toledo Health and Retiree Center, a clinic originally established by Gosser for Local 12 members but, since 1963, open to all -Other personal interests which are reflected in this collection are the advocacy of retirement at sixty, contained in the material on Sixty Now, and summer recreation for children of union members, exemplified by the material on the Children's Summer Camp in Onsted, Michigan. The bulk of the material in the Gosser Papers dates from the 1900 $. Prominent correspondents include Charles Ballard and Thomas Ludlow Ashley. During this period, the last decade of his life, Gosser's most troubling concern was a case against him, his assistant Donald J. Pinciotti, and Toledo numbers racketeer Ted Maison, on charges of conspiring to take a confidential report of an investigation into Gosser's finances from the Internal Revenue Service. Toledo trade unionists made the case a cause célèbre in their efforts to obtain clemency and pardon for Gosser. Although the case estranged Gosser from WaIter Reuther and the international leadership of the UAW, many other leaders of labor and other causes wrote letters in defense of Gosser to the President. There is other material useful for the study of postwar economic development in Toledo, This includes publications of the Toledo Industrial Development Council (1939, 1949) and a handbook of the Toledo Area Development Corporation (1962). The relations between individuals in Toledo labor unions, party politics, newspapers, and business can be studied through the use of different items in this collection. Gosser was known as a man with both many friends and many enemies. His collection, although not comprehensive in the representation of his entire career, does reveal the political power he had in his community. Note: Gosser's official UAW correspondence files and related items are housed in the Walter P. Reuther Library, Wayne State University.

It has more than 3 -fold reduced overall assay duration than the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, it has a wide detection range i. e. 0. 3 pg/mL- 20 ng/mL and 125 -fold better analytical sensitivity than the commercial ELISA kit. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored in 0. 1 M PBS without any significant loss of functional activity. The developed HFA CIA is multisubstrate-compatible and can be employed for immunoassays {{on a wide range of}} commercially-relevant substrates that are being used in various biosensors/point-of-care diagnostics. ### Introduction The development of a robust, rapid and highly-sensitive immunoassay format for the precise detection of HFA is an absolute requirement for clinical disease diagnosis. HFA is a highly specific biomarker for atherosclerosis (1) and hepatocellular carcinoma (2), which is also involved in diabetes (3), cardiovascular diseases (4), arthritis, metabolism-associated syndrome (5), and malaria 6. It is a liver-derived protein that is secreted into the bloodstream in the concentration range of 450 - 600 µg/mL. The concentration of HFA changes significantly in various pathophysiological conditions (1, 7 - 9). Several immunoassay formats have been developed till date for HFA detection, which were mainly based on ELISA (10 - 11), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (12), microarray (13), and electrochemical luminescence (6). However, ELISA is still the most widely used format and the accepted clinical standard for HFA detection. But in recent years, several highly-sensitive chemiluminescent substrates, having wide detection range and improved analytical sensitivity, have been developed (14). The developed CIA (15), being the most sensitive immunoassay format for HFA detection in comparison to ELISA and SPR, can have potential applications in clinical diagnostics. APTES has been widely used for the leach-proof immobilization of biomolecules (16 - 19) as it enables high immobilization density, long-term stability, high reproducibility, and less biofouling. It has been extensively employed for the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (20 - 22). In the present study, the covalent crosslinking of antibodies in a leach-proof manner on APTES-functionalized bioanalytical platform leads to higher functional antibody immobilization density that results in highly sensitive analyte detection. ### Reagents 1.

Incubate each of the desired wells of 96 -well CMTP with 100 μL of 1 % (w/v) KOH for 10 min at 37 ºC and wash five times with 300 μL of DIW per well. Washing can also be performed with an automatic plate washer. CRITICAL STEP KOH treatment should not be longer than 10 min as it may cause strong aberrations on the surface, thereby changing its surface properties. 2. Incubate the KOH-treated CMTP with 100 μL of 2 % (v/v) APTES for 1 h at RT inside the fume cabinet. Wash the APTES-modified wells extensively with DIW (as described in step 1). **Antibody immobilization and BSA blocking (TIMING 1 h 30 min) ** 3. Mix 5 µL each of EDC (8 mg/mL) SulfoNHS (22 mg/mL) to make 10 µL of pre-mixed EDC-SulfoNHS solution. **CRITICAL STEP** The ratio of EDC and SulfoNHS is critical for optimum cross-linking. **?

Add 100 µL of working solution, formed by mixing equal parts of SuperSignal ELISA Femto Luminol/Enhancer and SuperSignal ELISA Femto Stable Peroxide Solution, to each of the CMTP wells and incubate at RT for 5 min. **? TROUBLESHOOTING** 11. Record the chemiluminescent intensity at 425 nm in the Tecan Infinite M 200 Pro microplate reader. CRITICAL STEP The chemiluminescent intensity should always be measured immediately (or at a fixed time) as it is not an end-point immunoassay. ### Timing - Steps 1 - 2, Surface activation and APTES-functionalization: 1 h 10 min - Steps 3 - 6, Antibody immobilization and BSA blocking: 1 h 30 min - Steps 7 - 11, HFA CIA (sandwich format) : 2 h 25 min ### Troubleshooting Troubleshooting advice is provided in Table 1. ### Anticipated Results The developed CIA detected HFA in the range of 0. 3 pg/mL - 20 ng/mL (Figure 2 A) with linearity from 2. 5 - 312. 5 ng/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) and analytical sensitivity were 0. 3 pg/mL and 5 pg/mL, respectively. The various experimental controls demonstrated the highly specific detection of HFA and non-interference of BSA with any of the assay components (Figure 2 B). The inter- and intra-day variability were in the range of 2. 1 - 6. 3 % and 3 - 8. 2 %, respectively, while the half-effective concentration (EC 50) was 52 pg/mL. The intra- and inter-day variability were calculated from five assay repeats (in triplicate) on a single and five different days, respectively. The developed HFA CIA significantly decreased the overall assay duration by more than 3 -fold i. e. from 20 h (commercial HFA sandwich ELISA) to about 5. 5 h. It has better analytical performance as its analytical sensitivity (5 pg/mL) was 125 -fold better than that of the commercial HFA ELISA (625 pg/mL). Moreover, it has lower limit of detection (LOD) with better analytical sensitivity in comparison to our previously developed HFA immunoassay formats based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (12) and sandwich ELISA (10 - 11). The higher sensitivity of CIA is mainly due to the high functional antibody immobilization density on APTES-functionalized MTP and the higher sensitivity of chemiluminescent substrate (luminol/enhancer and stable peroxide solution). The enhancer in chemiluminescent substrate (14) results in rapid and highly intensified signal for a longer time, which enables wider detection range and low background. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored at 4 °C in 0. 1 M PBS for many weeks without any significant decrease in functional activity (15), which is useful for rapid analyte detection in mass-use applications such as clinical diagnosis. However, as the developed procedure takes only 1. 5 h for antibody immobilization, it will completely obviate the need of storing antibody-bound MTPs in industries, where they are usually stored for about two weeks. Our previously developed modified MTP format (23), which was specifically designed to perform immunoassays on different substrate platforms, was employed to demonstrate the multisubstrate-compatibility of developed HFA CIA that was mainly due to the generic nature of APTES-functionalization step. Various commercially-relevant substrates, i. e. PS, PC, PMMA, CA, Zeonex™ and Zeonor™, were used as they are being employed extensively for various biosensors, diagnostics, lab-on-a-chip technologies, and other bioanalytical applications (Figure 3). ### References 1.

(A) Assay performance of the developed HFA CIA. (B) Various experimental controls employed to demonstrate the specificity of developed CIA for HFA and its non-interference with various process steps. The controls 1 - 5 were anti-HFA-no HFA; BSA-no anti-HFA; BSA-no anti-HFA-no HFA; BSA-SA-HRP; and, BSA-luminol, respectively (15). All experiments were done in triplicate and the results are shown as mean ± standard deviation. **Figure 3 : Multisubstrate-compatibility** ![Fig 3]([URL] "Fig 3 ") *Multisubstrate-compatibility of developed HFA CIA on various commercially-relevant substrates, i. e. polystyrene (PS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), Zeonex (Znx), Zeonor (Znr), polycarbonate (PC) and cellulose acetate (CA), using our modified microtiter plate format (23).

The Section {{attempted}} unsuccessfully to sabotage deliveries of vital strategic materials to Germany from neutral countries by mining the Iron Gate on the River Danube. MI(R) meanwhile produced pamphlets and <b>technical</b> <b>handbooks</b> for guerrilla leaders. MI(R) was also involved {{in the formation of the}} Independent Companies, autonomous units intended to carry out sabotage and guerrilla operations behind enemy lines in the Norwegian Campaign, and the Auxiliary Units, stay-behind commando units based around the Home Guard which would act in the event of an Axis invasion of Britain, as seemed possible in the early years of the war.|$|R
