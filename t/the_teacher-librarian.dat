40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Dr. Susan Gaye La MarcaThis study investigates {{the role of the}} secondary school teacher-librarian {{in the creation of a}} reading environment. The factors that influence how and why a teacher-librarian carries out his or her role are the major focus of the study. These are explored through an analysis of the current literature and in case studies undertaken in six Melbourne secondary schools. The investigation found that each of the case study schools created and operated a reading environment that was affected to varying degrees by all of the identified factors. The factors are: The attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian</b> towards their professional responsibility in creating a reading environment, and towards their students as readers. The relationships forged between <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian</b> and teaching staff, administrators, other library staff and students. The organisational and policy decisions that affect access, such as collection management, reading promotion programs and the knowledge base and advisory role of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian.</b> The ambience within the library space and how this assists <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian</b> in creating a welcoming environment conducive to encouraging reading, including factors such as layout and display. The influences external to the library within the school including: budget allocation, staffing levels, support from the school administration, curriculum needs and the demands and limitations of architectural structures. The professional context of the school community and the wider educational and professional debate within which <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian</b> operates impact upon the attitudes and decisions of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian.</b> In addition, changes to broad educational objectives, the impact of lCT's, and the ongoing debate as to the role of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian</b> have had a marked impact upon each of the case study schools and their reading environments.

40|$|Introduction. {{changes in}} {{educational}} {{policy and practice}} demand that we examine school library programmes from a new perspective. As a model that takes a developmental view of minds in context, Cultural Historical Activity Theory is particularly well suited {{to the study of}} school libraries and the learning that occurs therein. This paper focuses on the activity theoretic concepts of 'contradictions' and 'expansive learning' as they relate to the development of best practices. Method. Developmental Work Research was applied as a guiding methodology in an intervention study of six high school libraries in Washington State, USA. Library activity is illustrated from multiple perspectives using a triangulated, qualitative approach. Analysis. contradictions and tensions in the general school library activity system are identified, and an intervention was designed to facilitiate the development of expansive instruments. A case example illustrates a second level of analysis and specific points of intervention. Results. analysis reveals that the tensions and contradictions provide opportunities for expansive learning on the part of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-Librarians.</b> <b>The</b> research team can use practitioners' zones of proximal development to guide the alignment of library programme goals and practices. Conclusion. : some limitations and future promise of the framework and its application are discussed.

The pilot study comprises of five sections - the literature review, the case study, the methodology, the findings and a final discussion. The appendices provide the evaluation methods the teacher-librarians in the pilot study used to gauge their own effectiveness and the transcripts of the interviews. The Literature Review draws a focus to the current research regarding the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian</b> to the literacy levels of students. Research from the United States and Australia indicate that positive relationships can be drawn between school libraries and student achievement. Although improved student outcomes can be drawn, the concept of student achievement is not always used consistently by the studies. The review outlines benchmark documents about the role of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian,</b> the function of the school library and guidelines for staffing and funding. Concepts need to be defined to provide common understandings about literacy and information literacy. Perspectives on the teaching and integration of information literacy as a factor in the success of students to perform in today’s information rich society are investigated. Information literacy is the key to independent learning and to further lifelong learning. The role of <b>the</b> <b>teacher-librarian</b> has seen many changes in catering for the information needs of students in a digital age. The school library needs to provide a connection with the whole school community and the provision of online services is a vital part of this service. This online concept goes beyond the services of a ‘virtual library’ but to cater for the millenial generation Web 2. 0 constructs need to be acknowledged. The review investigates the various perspectives and measurement strategies that could be used by teacher-librarians to measure their effectiveness in the whole school context. To reinforce the library’s position as an important part of the learning process, the school library should be able to demonstrate its alignment to the missions and goals of the whole school. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master's thesis is to examine and compare the process of {{starting}} a school library at schools which haven't had a school library before, and to examine and compare the experience of this process according to the principals and the persons responsible for the school library. I have examined two Swedish independent primary schools (age 6 - 15 years). I have made qualitative interviews with the principals and the persons responsible for the new school library. In all, I have made seven interviews. As requested by the new Swedish Educational Act, both schools had recently started creating school libraries. One of the schools had recruited a half-time <b>teacher-librarian</b> and <b>the</b> other had no staffing at all. In the interviews, I have examined {{the attitudes of the}} informants towards school libraries, if this attitude has changed during the process of starting the school library, the informants' experiences during this process and the informants' views on the school library as an agent for student achievement. I have used David V. Loertscher's taxonomies for the principal, the school librarian and the student, to analyze the statements of the informants. The result of the study shows that at the school without library staff, the person responsible for the library had a hard time starting it as there were no time allocated. The work was easier and quicker done at the school with <b>the</b> part-time <b>teacher-librarian.</b> <b>The</b> views of the school library and of its possibilities for student achievement, that the informants expressed, were positive at the school with the staffed library,as well as their experiences.

Method This qualitative study utilised the expanded critical incident approach, and investigated the real-life experiences of fifteen Australian teacher-librarians, through semi-structured interviews and inductive data analysis. Data collection utilised semi-structured interviews, on-site observations, journaling and the rubric for contextual information. These approaches allowed each of the interviewees to tell their own story and provided richness to the data. Analysis The analysis involved two types of data categorisation: binary and thematic. Binary classification was used to identify factual details. Thematic analysis involved categorising the emerging themes.

Owing to uneven resource-provisioning during the apartheid era, dysfunctional library facilities are a major concern in the majority of South African schools. Since only 7 % of state schools have functional school libraries, teaching and learning are negatively affected. The article is limited to just one part of a research project which investigated the Provision of School Libraries in Public High Schools in the Limpopo Province, South Africa.
