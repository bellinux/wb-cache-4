With the increase of the paddle wave steepness <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> level returns to <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> level characteristic of the pure wind waves. Further increase in the paddle wave steepness augments <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> further. <b>The</b> WOWC model explains this peculiarity of <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> distribution by <b>the</b> fact that the paddle waves significantly damp the wind waves in the spectral peak. <b>The</b> <b>stress</b> supported by these dominant waves rapidly falls when the paddle wave is introduced, and this decrease is not compensated by <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> induced by <b>the</b> paddle wave.

5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E

5|$|While living indoors {{decreases}} {{the risk of}} contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed an unhealthy diet, and <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health {{to make them more}} prone to specific conditions.

Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a zoonotic disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with strep throat. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness.

5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} Canis {{dentition}} {{shows that in}} comparison with the modern gray wolf and the Pleistocene LaBrea wolf, the Beringian wolf possessed large carnassial teeth and a short, broad palate relative to the size of its skull. The row length of the Beringian wolf's premolars was longer, the P4 premolar (the upper carnassial) longer and wider, and the M1, M2, and m1 (the lower carnassial) molars longer than those found in the other two types of wolves. The Beringian wolf's short, broad rostrum increased the force of a bite made with the canine teeth while strengthening the skull against <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> caused by struggling prey. Today, the relatively deep jaws {{similar to those of the}} Beringian wolf can be found in the bone-cracking spotted hyena and in those canids that are adapted for taking large prey. Beringian wolves possessed a craniodental morphology that was more specialized than modern gray wolves and Rancho LaBrea wolves for capturing, dismembering, and consuming the bones of very large megaherbivores, having evolved this way due to the presence of megafauna. Their stronger jaws and teeth indicate a hypercarnivorous lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E

The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with {{having to deal with}} censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan Stiles (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3–9).|$|E
