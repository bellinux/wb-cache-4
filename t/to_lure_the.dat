5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes retreated {{with much of}} the army back to Asia.

Mardonius retreated to Boeotia <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> <b>the</b> Greeks into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea. There, at the Battle of Plataea in August 479 BC, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army, and ending the invasion of Greece.
