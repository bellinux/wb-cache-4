Other failure modes are heat {{checking}} and <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Heat checking is when surface cracks {{occur on the}} die due to a large temperature change on every cycle. <b>Thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> is when surface cracks occur on the die due to {{a large number of}} cycles.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} 4 of these reactors, housed at two {{separate}} sites: Civaux and Chooz. Construction of these reactors started between 1984 and 1991, but full commercial operation {{did not begin}} until between 2000 and 2002 because of <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> flaws in the heat removal system requiring the redesign and replacement of parts in each N4 power station. In 2003 the stations were all uprated to 1500MWe.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Trenchant {{experienced}} a steam leak, forcing {{the crew to}} shut down the nuclear reactor. In 2000 a leak in the PWR1 reactor primary cooling circuit was discovered on Tireless, forcing her to proceed to Gibraltar on diesel power. The fault was found to be due to <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks, requiring the other Trafalgar-class boats, and some of the remaining Swiftsure-class boats, to be urgently inspected and if necessary modified. In August 2000 it was revealed that with Tireless still at Gibraltar, Torbay, Turbulent, Trenchant and Talent were at Devonport for refit or repair and with Trafalgar undergoing sea trials, only one boat, Triumph, was fully operational. By 2005, refits had reportedly corrected these problems.|$|E
40|$|Structural Ceramics have {{excellent}} wear- and heat-resistant characteristics. However, in some applications, {{they are exposed}} to very high temperatures and high heat-flux environments, and are also subjected to repeated thermal loadings that change rapidly with time. Such repeated thermal loadings are causes of material fracture. Therefore, it is important to investigate the <b>thermal</b> shock <b>fatigue</b> characteristics of these ceramics. We present results of <b>thermal</b> shock <b>fatigue</b> strength tests for a machinable structural ceramic called MACOR, composed of SiO_ 2 -MgO-Al_ 2 O_ 3. The <b>thermal</b> shock <b>fatigue</b> experiments were done using a CO_ 2 laser, and the crack generation of the specimens was measured from AE (acoustic emission) signals. Consequently, the <b>thermal</b> shock <b>fatigue</b> strength of MACOR was estimated from the critical power density, and it was proposed that the thermal shock strength of ceramics should be cstimated using a minimum value P_ [W/mm^ 2] of the critical power density below which ceramic fracture is independent of the spot diameter. Finally, the P_ of 0. 2 W/mm^ 2 was obtained from <b>thermal</b> shock <b>fatigue</b> experiments using MACOR...|$|R
40|$|The <b>thermal</b> {{shock and}} <b>fatigue</b> {{behavior}} of pressureless sintered Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -ZrO 2 (ASZ) composites was studied. The {{influence of the}} <b>thermal</b> shock and <b>fatigue</b> on the strengthening response of ASZ has been investigated by measuring the strength retention and microstructural changes. The magnitude of the flexural strength and fracture of the ASZ has been {{compared with that of}} the monolithic Al 2 O 3 (A) and Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 (AZ) composites under the same experimental conditions. Results indicated that the ASZ composites possess the highest resistance against <b>thermal</b> shock and <b>fatigue,</b> in comparison with A and AZ. The improvements were attributed to the enhancement in the fracture toughness of ASZ and the presence of multi-phase reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Severe {{cracking}} in reinforced and/or {{prestressed concrete}} structures usually {{results from the}} accumulation {{of a number of}} causes, such as errors in structural design, detailing of reinforcement, concrete composition, concrete curing, overloading under construction, early lowering of falsework, underestimated <b>thermal</b> loadings, <b>fatigue,</b> and lack of maintenance etc. The paper presents examples of a consistent strategy of diagnosis and therapy. ...|$|R
50|$|Molds for {{the casting}} process consist of two halves. Casting molds are usually formed from {{gray cast iron}} because it has about the best <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> resistance, but other {{materials}} include steel, bronze, and graphite. These metals are chosen because of their resistance to erosion and <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue.</b> They are usually not very complex because the mold offers no collapsibility to compensate for shrinkage. Instead the mold is opened {{as soon as the}} casting is solidified, which prevents hot tears. Cores can be used and are usually made from sand or metal.|$|E
5000|$|Molten ash {{that sticks}} to cooled {{surfaces}} can block cooling holes. This stops cooling air flow and heats surrounding metal, leading to accelerated <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue.</b> This process affects combustor and turbine components.|$|E
50|$|Exit {{temperature}} {{is dependent on}} the turbine upper temperature limit depending on the material. Reducing the temperature will also prevent <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> and hence failure.Accessories may also need their own cooling systems using air from the compressor or outside air.|$|E
40|$|Geometric {{discontinuities}} cause a large {{variation of}} stress and produce {{a significant increase in}} stress. The high stress due to the variation of geometry is called as ‘stress concentration’. This will increase when the loads are further applied. There are many investigators who have studied the stress distribution around the notches, grooves, and other irregularities of various machine components. This paper analyses the effects of <b>thermal</b> and <b>fatigue</b> load on a steam turbine rotor under the operating conditions. Stresses due to thermal and dynamic loads of High Pressure Steam Turbine Rotor of 210 MW power station are found in two stages. A source code is developed for calculating the nominal stress at each section of HPT rotor. Maximum stress is obtained using FEA at the corresponding section. <b>Thermal</b> and <b>Fatigue</b> Stress Concentration Factors at each section are calculated. It is observed that the SCFdue to the combined effect of thermal and dynamic loads at the temperatures beyond 5400 C is exceeding the safe limits...|$|R

50|$|As stated above, {{the mold}} is heated {{prior to the}} first casting cycle and then used {{continuously}} {{in order to maintain}} as uniform a temperature as possible during the cycles.

50|$|In view of cost or fuel economy, {{manufacturers}} need {{to consider}} ever more new materials and corresponding manufacturing methods.
