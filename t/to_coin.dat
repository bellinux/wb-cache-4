5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about {{the size of}} a half dollar) being issued by the Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive <b>to</b> <b>coin.</b> After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E

5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{refurbishment}} and recommissioning of the New Orleans Mint was due {{partly to}} the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. had passed the Bland–Allison Act, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The Treasury Department needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed former Mississippi Senator and governor Henry S. Foote the new superintendent of the mint.|$|E

5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> more five-cent pieces.

5|$|Despite this setback in his {{official}} career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after Emperor Shun of Han (r. 125–144) ascended to the throne. His intensive astronomical work was rewarded {{only with the}} rank and salary of 600bushels, or shi, of grain (mostly commuted <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> cash or bolts of silk). To place this number in context, in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000bushels during the Han. The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout the country. Bullion producers opted <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the legislators}} would become {{prominent}} figures during the territorial years of Oregon. At first {{the body was}} a small committee of nine people, but the group was altered when the Organic Laws of Oregon were revised in 1845 with the legislative branch of the Provisional Government becoming the Oregon House of Representatives {{with a minimum of}} 13 members. Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, because it was in conflict with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult <b>to</b> <b>coin.</b> Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{claimed the}} Mascarene parrot {{was found on}} Madagascar, an idea that led the French naturalist and ornithologist René Primevère Lesson <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when Tommaso Salvadori {{combined}} it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name {{in which the two}} parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.|$|E

5|$|On {{monetary}} issues, Blaine {{continued the}} advocacy {{for a strong}} dollar that he had begun as a Representative. The issue had shifted from debate over greenbacks to debate over which metal should back the dollar: gold and silver, or gold alone. The Coinage Act of 1873 stopped the coinage of silver for all coins worth a dollar or more, effectively tying the dollar {{to the value of}} gold. As a result, the money supply contracted and the effects of the Panic of 1873 grew worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had entered into when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill, which passed the House, that required the United States <b>to</b> <b>coin</b> as much silver as miners could sell the government, thus increasing the money supply and aiding debtors. In the Senate, William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa offered an amendment to limit the silver coinage to two to four million dollars per month. This was still too much for Blaine, and he denounced the bill and the proposed amendment, but the amended Bland–Allison Act passed the Senate by a 48 to 21 vote. Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress mustered the two-thirds vote to pass it over his veto. Even after the Bland–Allison Act’s passage, Blaine continued his opposition, making a series of speeches against it during the 1878 congressional campaign season.|$|E

50|$|Mint-made {{errors are}} errors in a coin {{made by the}} mint during the minting process. Groups of coins with {{distinctive}} characteristics are known as varieties. The term variety applies <b>to</b> <b>coins</b> with both intended and unintended differences while the term error refers only <b>to</b> <b>coins</b> with unintended differences. Nevertheless, not all errors are varieties. Although there may be many identical examples of a some errors, others are unique.

Although no other coin may be identical <b>to</b> a <b>coin</b> with an off-center strike, off-center strikes happen often enough that buyers can choose from many examples each of which varies slightly from the other.|$|R
