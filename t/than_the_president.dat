25|$|Miller {{initiated}} several {{democratic reforms}} which affected the renegotiation {{of the national}} coal collective bargaining agreement. UMWA's bargaining demands were now set by a 36-member bargaining council rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and his aides. Tentative agreements now were subject to approval by the bargaining council and member ratification. Wildcat strikes had become common in the coal industry as union miners grew frustrated with {{what they saw as}} poor terms of national contracts and employer foot-dragging on resolving disputes and grievances. Miller hoped that these democratic reforms would decrease the number of wildcat strikes.|$|E

25|$|Louis McLane (May 28, 1786 – October 7, 1857) was an American {{lawyer and}} {{politician}} from Wilmington, in New Castle County, Delaware, and Baltimore, Maryland.

As a member of President Andrew Jackson's Cabinet, McLane was a prominent figure during the Bank War. McLane pursued a more moderate approach towards the Second Bank of the United States <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> but agreed with Jackson's decision in 1832 to veto a Congressional bill renewing the Bank's charter. He also helped draft the Force Bill in 1833.|$|E

On 4 November 1996, Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Leghari {{primarily because of}} corruption, who used the Eighth Amendment discretionary powers to dissolve the government.

However, despite being considered successful by many, this controversial endeavour partially backfired and led to the increasing factionalism within <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> inner circle.

According to Moscow, [...] "his appeal for the party to be the party of the Loyal Opposition, supporting the President, was treason to the diehards; his trip around the world marked him as a Presidential agent seeking to infiltrate the Republican Party".

500|$|On January 7, 1930, salary {{negotiations}} between the Yankees and Ruth quickly broke down. Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five—the latter figure equalling the annual salary of then US President Herbert Hoover; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why {{he thought he was}} [...] "worth more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the United States," [...] Ruth responded: [...] "Say, if I hadn't been sick last summer, I'd have broken hell out of that home run record! Besides, the President gets a four-year contract. I'm only asking for three." [...] Exactly two months later, a compromise was reached, with Ruth settling for two years at an unprecedented $80,000 per year.|$|E
500|$|Gerry vigorously {{supported}} Alexander Hamilton's {{reports on}} public credit, including the assumption at full value of state debts, and supported Hamilton's new Bank of the United States, positions consistent with earlier calls {{he had made}} for economic centralization. [...] Although he speculated in depreciated Continental bills of credit (the IOUs at issue), {{there is no evidence}} he participated in large-scale speculation that attended the debate when it took place in 1790, and he became a major investor in the new bank. [...] He used the floor of the House to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to republican ideals, and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties. [...] He opposed any attempt to give officers of the executive significant powers, specifically opposing establishment of the Treasury Department because its head might gain more power <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> [...] He opposed measures that strengthened the Presidency (such as the ability to fire cabinet officers), seeking instead to give the legislature more power over appointments.|$|E

Sestak did not dispute {{the authenticity of the}} letter, but told the press he wanted to discuss the matter with his family before making a formal decision. Sestak told media outlets he realized President Obama wished him not to run against Specter, but that he felt the choice should be with the voters of Pennsylvania rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> Governor Rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run, believing it would damage Sestak's own political future, plus cost the Democratic Party both Sestak's House seat and possibly damage Specter's general election chances. Nevertheless, Sestak formally declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on August 4, 2009, in a speech before a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in his native Delaware County. Shortly after the announcement, Toomey issued a statement welcoming Sestak to the race, describing him as [...] "a consistent liberal who really believes in his values", as compared to Specter, who he called [...] "a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re-election".|$|E

Extreme price gouging occurred in the city following the hurricane, with one consumer protection official reporting shopkeepers charging 200percent more for milk, 500percent more for tortillas, and 1000percent more than usual for water. Even though the government was blamed for lack of warnings and water shortages, Ernesto Zedillo, the president of Mexico at that time, cut his vacation in Europe short to respond to the catastrophe. [...] Government officials set up 39aid centers for Acapulco citizens, though some residents were unable to get food and water. Some residents suspected <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and his Institutional Revolutionary Party of taking aid supplies for their own purposes.
