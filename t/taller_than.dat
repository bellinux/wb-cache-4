It comes from south coast in Victoria, {{propagated}} by Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The added {{height of}} the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest {{building}} {{in the world and}} the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure. The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> , and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E

Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> Anastasia and was also <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the city}} has a modest number of skyscrapers and {{high-rise}} buildings, and many additional high-rise buildings are planned, have been approved, or are under construction. Though buildings rising up to 20 stories were built on Mount Carmel in the past, the Haifa municipality banned the construction of any new buildings <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> nine stories on Mount Carmel in July 2012.|$|E

50|$|This waterfall, {{located about}} 2 km {{southwest}} of Tambdi Surla, at the Karnataka border, is equally spectacular and {{only slightly less}} <b>tall</b> <b>than</b> Dudsagar Falls, however it is rarely visited because of its difficult access by a steep, winding and irregular rocky path. A local guide is required.|$|R
5|$|In 1924, Los Angeles imposed height {{restrictions}} {{throughout the}} city, effectively prohibiting {{the construction of}} any building <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> Los Angeles City Hall (454ft/138 m). It was intended to address local concerns about growing congestion and overdevelopment at the time. That height limit was lifted in Downtown Los Angeles by the city government in 1957.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming more unusual.|$|E
5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> long, but the neural spines are proportionally <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
50|$|Recently a local Native American {{group called}} The Red Storm Drum & Dance Troupe has {{reached out to}} President Donald Trump to revive the project, {{suggesting}} one {{on a smaller scale}} (the new statue, to be erected by sculptor Gregory Perillo, would be only 25 feet <b>tall)</b> <b>than</b> originally proposed.|$|R
50|$|Transmission aerials of {{transmitters}} {{working at}} frequencies below the longwave broadcasting band always apply electric lengthening. Broadcasting aerials of longwave broadcasting stations apply it often. However, for transmission aerials of NDBs electrical lengthening is extensively applied, because these use antennas which are considerably less <b>tall</b> <b>than</b> {{a quarter of}} the radiated wavelength.|$|R
5000|$|The Kew {{specimen}} (mature by the 1990s but felled in 2015 as 'unsafe') had {{the appearance}} of a northern European field elm, more <b>tall</b> <b>than</b> broad. 'Karagatch' was described by the US Department of Agriculture (1917) as a [...] "rapid-growing elm", suitable for semi-arid regions, with harder wood than that of American Elm.|$|R

Cohen was recast as Skinhead, one of Biff's cohorts. Had Fox been cast from the beginning, Cohen probably would have won the part because he was sufficiently <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> Fox.|$|E
5|$|With over 400 active volcanos, Io is {{the most}} geologically active object in the Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> Earth's Mount Everest. Unlike most {{satellites}} in the outer Solar System (which have a thick coating of ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A.detmoldii {{to produce}} A.× pamela. Known only from road verges in the Scott River region, {{it was first}} {{discovered}} in 1979, {{and it is now}} known from more than twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> A.obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E

Slim and delicately built, more <b>tall</b> <b>than</b> short, she kept a certain elegance into her later years, an elegance which hovered charmingly between {{the behavior of a}} fine lady and a worthy middle-class woman." ...|$|R
5|$|In June 1874, {{the whole}} of Northumberland House was {{purchased}} by the Metropolitan Board of Works and demolished to form Northumberland Avenue, which would accommodate hotels. Contemporary planning permissions forbade hotels to be <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> {{the width of the}} road they were on; consequently Northumberland Avenue was built with a wide carriageway. Part of the parallel Northumberland Street was demolished in order {{to make way for the}} avenue's eastern end. The street was open by 1876. The hotels were popular for American visitors as they were near to the West End, government buildings on Whitehall and all the mainline stations.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have {{proportionally}} shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of intelligence {{that may or may not}} be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the elevator was also essential {{to the emergence of}} the early skyscrapers, as office buildings <b>taller</b> <b>than</b> around six stories would have been impractical without them. Powered elevators were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to U.S. factories and hotels by the 1840s. Elevators using hoist ropes, however, could only function effectively in low-rise buildings, and this limitation encouraged the introduction of the hydraulic elevator in 1870, even though early models contained dangerous design flaws. By 1876 these problems had been resolved, providing a solution for servicing the early skyscrapers.|$|E
