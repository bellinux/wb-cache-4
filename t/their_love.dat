5000|$|Palliative care is an {{especially}} demanding task for cancer caregivers than less progressive cancer because the care required for those with terminal cancer {{tends to be more}} demanding. [...] Caregivers in this situation often report high caregiver burden lasting the entire period. Caregiver distress also tends to increase as patients progress through this phase, causing a lower caregiver quality of life. Having a difficult time with caregiving increases distress caregivers face as they enter the bereavement period after the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> one, whereas finding meaning in caring for <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> one may relate to better long term adjustment for caregivers. Before bereavement, loved ones often face anticipatory grief, where they mourn and prepare for the loss of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> one. Families often react with fears of abandonment, anxiety, hopelessness and helplessness, and an intensified attachment to <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> one. Upon the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> one, caregivers typically experience grief, which in a minority of cases may be complicated by a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder later in the grief process.|$|R
