The link with Francia is illustrative of the <b>trading</b> <b>and</b> cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to give a {{comprehensive}} explanation of the worldwide <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> environment conflicts and a thorough analysis of the <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> environment debate between <b>trade</b> specialists <b>and</b> environmentalists.
