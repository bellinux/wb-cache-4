5|$|Atticus {{does not}} want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is {{available}} on the main floor, so by invitation of the Rev. Sykes, Jem, Scout, and Dill watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is Atticus', when <b>the</b> <b>hapless</b> Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.|$|E
5|$|Renaudin, seeing <b>the</b> <b>hapless</b> {{condition}} of his ship, ordered his flags hoisted half-mast in surrender and distress around 14:00, but after her surrender no British ship {{managed to get}} men aboard to take possession. This left Vengeurs few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could. Ultimately the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and Vengeur began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged HMS Alfred and Culloden, {{as well as the}} services of the cutter Rattler, saved any of the Vengeur's crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of Rattler was especially commended for this hazardous work. By 18:15, Vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded and the dead remained aboard, though some possibly stayed aboard in the hope of being rescued by a French ship rather than a British and avoid captivity.|$|E

5|$|Writing for Cinefantastique, David J. Hogan {{described}} {{plans for}} the original footage to be redubbed using a new screenplay written by Mark and Allan Estrin, with Clarke's character Gil renamed Ishmael Pivnik. This version was to center on Pivnik, whose formula for an oral suntan lotion transforms <b>the</b> <b>hapless</b> scientist into a monster. Salem and Brown were inspired by Woody Allen's redubbing of the 1965 Japanese spy thriller film , which Allen then transformed into his directorial debut comedy film, What's Up, Tiger Lily?. The resulting redubbing was titled What's Up, Hideous Sun Demon (also known as Revenge of the Sun Demon), which was released with the original director's permission. Salem and Brown were not credited as the producers in this version, which was produced by Jeffrey A. Montgomery and written by Craig Mitchell. New footage for this version was shot with Clarke's son Cam along with Googy Gress, Mark Holton and Susan Tyrell. Actor and talk show host Jay Leno provided the uncredited voice for McKenna.|$|E
