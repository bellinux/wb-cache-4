5|$|The {{assets of}} Icelandic pension funds are, {{according}} to one expert, expected <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> by 15–25%. The Icelandic Pension Funds Association has announced that benefits will in all likelihood have to be cut in 2009. Iceland's GDP is expected by economists <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> {{by as much as}} 10% {{as a result of the}} crisis, putting Iceland by some measures in an economic depression. Inflation may climb as high as 75% by the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent of the curve. Therefore, the total time for a curve <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> to a point is proportional to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that the {{radiation}} caused the tumour <b>to</b> <b>shrink.</b> Independently, Alexander Graham Bell also suggested the use of radiation in this way. In the early twentieth century, techniques for the application of brachytherapy were pioneered at the Curie institute in Paris by Danlos and at St Luke's and Memorial Hospital in New York by Robert Abbe.|$|E

SLE can cause pleuritic pain and also give rise <b>to</b> <b>shrinking</b> lung syndrome, involving a reduced lung volume. Other associated lung conditions include pneumonitis, chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary emboli, and pulmonary hemorrhage.|$|R

The Pacers tried to trade Dahntay Jones and Solomon Jones to keep Rolle, but the trade fell through and the Pacers were reluctant to drop Solomon Jones {{due to a lack of}} depth in the frontcourt. Had he made the roster, Rolle would have earned $510,000, but instead he made $50,000 in a buyout.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} {{tourist facilities}} in Death Valley were {{a set of}} tent houses built in the 1920s where Stovepipe Wells is now located. People flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties. In 1927, Pacific Coast Borax turned the crew quarters of its Furnace Creek Ranch into a resort, creating the Furnace Creek Inn and resort. The spring at Furnace Creek was harnessed to develop the resort, and as the water was diverted, the surrounding marshes and wetlands started <b>to</b> <b>shrink.</b>|$|E

5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit <b>to</b> <b>shrink.</b>|$|E

Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.|$|E
5|$|Kono {{described}} Clock Tower as {{an experimental}} project {{with a small}} budget and staff. His peers believed that a game where the protagonist runs away from the enemy would not work, but he continued on despite these concerns. Due to lack of staffing resources, developer Human Entertainment could not include mouse support and also needed <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> the map down significantly. Although the graphics are two-dimensional, the mansion is designed within a 3D space. The character graphics in Clock Tower were created by digitizing photographs of real people, a popular technique of the time. The actress for Jennifer was a woman in Human's planning division. Many of the motions in the game came from her acting, such as hanging from a roof and stumbling in the hallway.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Dave witness {{one of the}} klowns using shadow puppets <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> a {{crowd of}} people into the palm of its hand, then dump them into a sack of popcorn, {{revealed}} to be sentient creatures that eagerly gobble up the human prey. Back at the police station, Mooney is innundated with calls from townspeople reporting incidents with the klowns, but he dismisses all of them. Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|Out of desperation, Douchebag is told {{to invite}} the girls to play. They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an {{abortion}} clinic and travels across Canada to discover which of their friends is spreading gossip. Flanked by the girls, kindergarten pirates, and Star Trek role-players, the humans and elves attack Clyde's dark tower. Randy arrives and reveals that the government agents have planted a nuclear device in Mr. Slave's anus to blow up South Park, forcing Douchebag <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> and enter Mr. Slave to disarm the bomb. After exiting Mr. Slave, Douchebag finally confronts Clyde and is forced to fight a resurrected Nazi Zombie Chef; Chef is defeated. Clyde decides he is not playing any more and Cartman kicks him from the tower.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down to Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to enable him to infiltrate situations to which no ordinary-sized person could make a discreet entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> enemy agents, literally bringing them down to Harding's size.|$|E

5|$|Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, {{had gained}} a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} government of the Kingdom of England after his victory at the Battle of Lewes a year earlier. He also held the King, Prince Edward, and the King's brother Richard of Cornwall in his custody. However, his sphere of influence began <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> rapidly, owing to loss of key allies. In February, Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower. An even more important collaborator, Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, deserted {{to the side of the}} King in May of the same year. With Gloucester's assistance, Prince Edward escaped from Montfort's captivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 29 August, the Japanese renewed their attack. In {{possession of}} the ridges that dominated the Australian position {{from both sides of}} the valley in which it sat, the Japanese were able to lay down considerable volumes of mortar and machine gun fire in support of their assaults. Unable to respond with similar firepower, the Australian perimeter began <b>to</b> <b>shrink.</b> It was during this stage of the fighting that Private Bruce Kingsbury of the 2/14th made a unique individual contribution to the campaign and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result. Kingsbury's was the first Victoria Cross awarded for actions on Australian soil.|$|E
5|$|Viète {{used this}} {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>shrink</b> {{one of the}} given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first solved the CLL case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a LLP case. He then solved the CLP case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to a point, Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP case. He then solved the CPP case (a circle and two points) and the CCP case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to a point, rendering it a CCP case.|$|E
