500|$|Browning downplayed {{evidence}} {{brought to}} him by his intelligence officer, Major Brian Urquhart, that the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg were in the Arnhem area, but was not as confident as he led his subordinates to believe. According to Major-General Urquhart, GOC of the British 1st Airborne Division, when informed that his airborne troops would have to hold the bridge for two days, Browning responded that they could hold it for four, but later claimed to Urquhart that he had added: [...] "But I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be going a bridge too far." ...|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Arthur Montague [...] "Boy" [...] Browning, [...] (20 December 1896– 14 March 1965) was {{a senior}} officer of the British Army who {{has been called the}} [...] "father of the British {{airborne}} forces". He was the commander of I Airborne Corps and deputy commander of First Allied Airborne Army during Operation Market Garden in September 1944. During the planning for this operation, he memorably said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be going a bridge too far." [...] He was also an [...] Olympic bobsleigh competitor, and the husband of author Dame Daphne du Maurier.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Richards sparked rumours {{that a new}} Rolling Stones studio album may be forthcoming, saying {{during an}} {{interview}} following the premiere of Shine a Light, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> make another album. Once we get over doing promotion on this film". Watts remarked that he got ill whenever he stopped working. In July 2008 {{it was announced that}} the Rolling Stones were leaving EMI and signing with Vivendi's Universal Music, taking with them their catalogue stretching back to Sticky Fingers. New music released by the band while under this contract will be issued through Universal's Polydor label. Mercury Records will hold the US rights to the pre-1994 material, while the post-1994 material will be handled by Interscope Records (once a subsidiary of Atlantic).|$|E

5000|$|Such {{advances}} {{were considered}} impossible because the basic {{laws of physics}} and science were not understood {{as well as they}} would subsequently be. Kaku states that “as a physicist he learned that the impossible is often a relative term.” By this definition of [...] "impossible", he poses the question [...] "Is it not plausible to <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> someday build space ships that can travel distances of light years, or <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> teleport ourselves from one place to the other?" ...|$|R
500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." [...] George Clooney joked, [...] "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay". Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have killed the franchise", and called it [...] "a waste of money".|$|E
500|$|SpaceChem was {{generally}} well received by critics, with an aggregate Metacritic score of 84 out of 100 from its Microsoft Windows release. Quintin Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have just received {{one of the}} year's best indie games {{in the first week}} of 2011". Gamasutra's Margaret Robertson praised SpaceChems gameplay, contrasting it with other open-ended activities as it offers the opportunity for the player to be as creative as they want to be within the minimal ruleset required of each puzzle. Robertson also found the game to be thrilling, having each puzzle initially appear [...] "so astonishingly dispiriting" [...] to what she had previously learned, but through trial and error coming to a solution that works and giving her the feeling of having [...] "made a creative statement" [...] in her solution. Eurogamer's John Teti praised the means through which the game introduced new mechanics without excessive reliance on tutorials; he commented that [...] "the problems become more daunting" [...] through the addition of new elements and commands, the game [...] "is always more accessible than it looks". Edge said [...] "The triumph of SpaceChem is that overcoming these situations is more a case of inventing a solution than discovering one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2009, they {{announced}} that writing has begun on Series 5, but by May 2010, Turner said: [...] "We sort of {{felt like it}} was the end two years ago.
