5|$|Kiri Noh (切り能, final plays) or oni mono (鬼物, demon plays) usually {{feature the}} shite {{in the role}} of monsters, goblins, or demons, and are often {{selected}} for <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> colors and fast-paced, tense finale movements. Kiri Noh is performed the last in a five-play program. There are roughly 30 plays in this category, most of which are shorter than the plays in the other categories.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frogs are {{an example}} of an aposematic organism. <b>Their</b> <b>bright</b> {{coloration}} advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration. This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Loss of wetland habitat threatens {{dragonfly}} populations {{around the}} world. Dragonflies {{are represented in}} human culture on artifacts such as pottery, rock paintings, and Art Nouveau jewellery. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. <b>Their</b> <b>bright</b> colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the prose of H. E. Bates.|$|E

5|$|Poisonous species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, {{it is likely to}} remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
25|$|In Lyramoprha parens, nymphs {{are also}} {{known to be}} highly gregarious, forming massed feeding groups and moving to new feeding sites in {{close-packed}} groups.

25|$|The {{behavior}} and appearance of UDS and its bright companion {{were similar to}} Neptunian Great Dark Spots (GDS) and <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> companions, respectively, though UDS was significantly smaller. This similarity suggests {{that they have the}} same origin. GDS were hypothesized to be anticyclonic vortices in the atmosphere of Neptune, whereas <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> companions were thought to be methane clouds formed in places, where the air is rising (orographic clouds). UDS is supposed to have a similar nature, although it looked differently from GDS at some wavelengths. Although GDS had the highest contrast at 0.47μm, UDS was not visible at this wavelength. On the other hand, UDS demonstrated the highest contrast at 1.6μm, where GDS were not detected. This implies that dark spots on the two ice giants are located at somewhat different pressure levels—the Uranian feature probably lies near 4bar. The dark color of UDS (as well as GDS) may be caused by thinning of the underlying hydrogen sulfide or ammonium hydrosulfide clouds.|$|E
25|$|In some fairy-wrens such as {{the superb}} and red-backed, males pick flower petals in colors {{contrasting}} with <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> nuptial plumage and present them to others of their species that will acknowledge, inspect and sometimes manipulate the petals. This function seems not linked to sexual or aggressive activity in the short and medium term thereafter, though its function is apparently not aggressive and quite possibly sexual.|$|E
25|$|Oncomerines {{of the genera}} Cumare, Garceus, and Peltocopta {{exhibit the}} most {{advanced}} form of maternal care. Like the previously described Southeast Asian Pygoplatys individuals, the females actually carry young nymphs around on their abdomens. As the nymphs grow older, they eventually separate from their mothers, lose <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> colors, and become more solitary prior to molting into adults. Species which exhibit this behavior often have significantly flattened and expanded abdomens.|$|E

25|$|There is a “HELP” {{phone system}} on campus. This is {{a network of}} {{approximately}} 110 emergency “HELP” phones scattered about campus that are available for people to use if they feel they are in danger or in an uncomfortable situation. These phones are easily recognizable by <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> blue light and have an emergency button that anyone can press which will automatically connect them to the UMass Police Department. This will alert the police to the users exact position and they can send appropriate assistance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to chlorophylls, {{another group of}} yellow–orange pigments called carotenoids are {{also found in the}} photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids. They help transfer and dissipate excess energy, and <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the fall, when the leaves of some land plants change color. β-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. Xanthophylls, especially the orange-red zeaxanthin, are also common. Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.|$|E

The already low sun appears from the direction of the viewer on the two sides to seeing women whose long shadows loom on the beach behind them. Playback of these lighting effects under the southern sun are typical Valenciano for Luminismo, one in Spain resulting from the Impressionism as a special form of Neo-Impressionism, whose main representative was Joaquín Sorolla.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 the West of England Main Line {{came under}} the control of the Network SouthEast (NSE) sector, which saw the {{introduction}} of <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> blue, red and white livery. The first locomotive in this livery was again 50023 Howe. The NSE livery had two versions; the original had upswept red and white stripes and the ends, with a white cab surround; the revised livery introduced in 1988 had the red and white stripes continue to the body ends, with a blue cab surround. In the revised livery the blue became a darker shade.|$|E
25|$|Like their wild ancestors, {{common and}} comet {{goldfish}} {{as well as}} Shubunkin can survive, and even thrive, in any climate that can support a pond, whereas fancy goldfish are unlikely {{to survive in the}} wild as <b>their</b> <b>bright</b> colours and long fins make them easy prey. Goldfish can hybridise with certain other species of carp as well as C. a. gibelio. Within three breeding generations, {{the vast majority of the}} hybrid spawn revert to the wild type colour. Koi may also interbreed with the goldfish to produce sterile hybrids.|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} distances, cosmologists use {{the fact}} that Type Ia supernovae are nearly standard candles: exploding stars of this type all have nearly the same absolute brightness or luminosity when they reach <b>their</b> <b>brightest</b> phase.
