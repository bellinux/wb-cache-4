40|$|Operational weather {{prediction}} systems do not currently make {{full use of}} <b>infra-red</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> that {{are affected by the}} presence of cloud. Observations that are affected by cloud are routinely discarded during pre-processing. This is because cloud causes large, unpredictable, and nonlinear changes in the observed radiances, and obscures the atmosphere underneath from view. This disrupts the finely-balanced calculations used to convert small changes in observed radiance into temperature and humidity profiles of the atmosphere. Areas that contain cloud are likely to be meteorologically interesting, so where information {{on the state of the}} atmosphere is most desired, it is also in shortest supply. This thesis explores the possibility of using the large changes over time of cloud-affected <b>infra-red</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> to calculate the vertical component of wind. In order to explore the mathematical and practical issues of assimilating data from cloudy radiances, a study has been performed using an idealised single column atmospheric model developed for this purpose. The model simulates cloud development in an atmosphere with vertical motion and the effects on simulated <b>infra-red</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>observations.</b> An empirical method and a variational data assimilation system have been developed to process sequences of observations over a six hour time with the goal of calculating vertical velocity. These two methods combined allow vertical velocity to be determined with an RMS error of approximately 0. 8 cm/s in 80...|$|R
40|$|Operational {{analyses}} of Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) have many potential uses including improvement of {{numerical weather prediction}} (NWP) models on regional scales. In November 2011, LSWT {{was included in the}} Met Office Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Ice Analysis (OSTIA) product, for 248 lakes globally. The OSTIA analysis procedure, which has been optimised for oceans, has also been used for the lakes in this first version of the product. <b>Infra-red</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> of lakes and in situ measurements are assimilated. The <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> are based on retrievals optimised for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) which, although they may introduce inaccuracies into the LSWT data, are currently the only near-real-time information available. The LSWT analysis has a global root mean square difference of 1. 31 K and a mean difference of 0. 65 K (including a cool skin effect of 0. 2 K) compared to independent data from the ESA ARC-Lake project for a 3 -month period (June to August 2009). It is demonstrated that the OSTIA LSWT is an improvement over the use of climatology to capture the day-to-day variation in global lake surface temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Africa {{to the impact}} of climate change, which results in natural disasters and environmental degradation, accelerates hardship and poverty for millions of Africans. However, Africa still lacks the necessary scientific and technical capacity to assess fully and to monitor the possible future impacts of climate change. One of the instruments available to address the challenges of environmental monitoring (including climate change) and to provide early warnings of natural and human-made disasters for Africa's development is Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites.</b> Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> record Earth's information from space and provide accurate, continuous, simultaneous measurements of our planet. The results of the application of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> have long term social benefits which include the early detection of hurricanes and typhoons that can lead to prompt warnings for areas predicted to be affected, thus providing crucial time to implement safety measures to mitigate the effects of such disasters. Several authors concur with this position, stating that the global view from <b>satellite</b> <b>observation</b> is unmatched in its ability to capture the dynamics and variability of Earth processes. The capability to predict weather (among other things) has led Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> to become essential to everyday applications that improve human safety and quality of life. However, despite the many benefits of the use of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites,</b> it still remains a major challenge for Africa to explore the full potential of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> in addressing continental needs (Figure 1).
