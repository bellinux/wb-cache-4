5|$|The Selfe family {{landed at}} Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> {{emigrated to the}} colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small house {{that had previously been}} the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing {{to be left behind}} to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E

Obviously, however, the demands of living alone make it very unlikely that they will be able to obtain education through leaving.|$|E
25|$|In imperial-times Chinese {{social and}} {{religious}} culture there were charitable organizations for virtually every social service: burial of the dead, care of orphans, provision {{of food for}} the hungry. The wealthiest in every community—typically, the merchants—were expected to give food, medicine, clothing, and even cash to those in need. According to Caroline Reeves, a historian at Emmanuel College in Boston, that began to change {{with the arrival of}} American missionaries in the late 19th century. One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> gave for being there was to help the poor Chinese.|$|E
25|$|The {{tendency}} of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF) is a hypothesis in economics and political economy, most famously expounded by Karl Marx in chapter 13 of Capital, Volume III. Although not accepted in 20th century mainstream economics, {{the existence of such}} a tendency was widely noted throughout the 19th century. Economists as diverse as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, David Ricardo and Stanley Jevons referred explicitly to the TRPF as an empirical phenomenon that needed to be explained. They differed in <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> gave for why the TRPF might necessarily occur.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the signing}} of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, unionist {{politicians}} Christopher and Michael McGimpsey brought a suit against the Irish government in the High Court arguing that the Agreement was unconstitutional under Articles 2 and 3, because it recognised that Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. This argument was unusual coming from unionists because of the traditional unionist opposition to these two articles, but was undertaken to undermine an agreement they opposed, albeit not for <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> opposed it. Their case failed in the High Court, and again on appeal to the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, a {{committee}} {{was set up}} to get La Tinta to municipality status but these pioneers confronted serious problems, including death threats and had to desist. A new committee was formed in 1987, {{but it was not until}} 1999 that the group directed by José Gilberto Artola Choc accomplished the new designation. <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> argued to get their independent status were the distance that Panzós was from La Tinta -30km, approximately- the increase in economic activity in La Tinta -and the decay in Panzós after the Verapaz Railroad ceased operations in the 1960s-, the population was more than enough to get the municipality designation and the lack of support that Panzós gave La Tinta.|$|E
25|$|Then on 2 May {{they beat}} Hampshire easily by 60 runs, before easily beat Berkshire over 2 {{days in the}} first round of the C Trophy. The next two games were Championship encounters: a win over Division One {{whipping}} boys, Glamorgan and a defeat at Lord's to Middlesex. Little one-day practice may have been one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> lost by three wickets to Surrey in the C Trophy, as they hadn't played a one-day game in two weeks. This one-day drought had also left them languishing near the bottom of the table, and a no-result against Middlesex didn't help. An innings defeat by Nottinghamshire followed, which left them eighth in Division One of the Championship at the end of May, and they ended the month with a League loss to Lancashire.|$|E

500|$|Beagles are {{excellent}} {{with children and}} this is one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> have become popular family pets, but they are pack animals, and are prone to separation anxiety, a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended. [...] Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as [...] "speaking", [...] "giving tongue", or [...] "opening") when they catch the scent of potential quarry. They also generally get along well with other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.|$|E
500|$|Sports {{journalists have}} {{articulated}} the idea {{with increasing frequency}} that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> cite are that it is unsportsmanlike, is a [...] "knee-jerk" [...] reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game, {{and that it is}} simply a waste of time. The Journal of Sport and Social Issues Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity. However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.|$|E

500|$|Catherine Seipp of National Review Online {{described}} it as a [...] "nasty but extremely funny" [...] cartoon. Caryn James of The New York Times called it a show with an [...] "outrageously satirical family" [...] that [...] "includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies". The Sydney Morning Herald named Family Guy the [...] "Show of the Week" [...] on April 21, 2009, hailing it a [...] "pop culture-heavy masterpiece". Frazier Moore from The Seattle Times called it an [...] "endless craving for humor about bodily emissions". He thought it was [...] "breathtakingly smart" [...] and said a [...] "blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal". He summarized it as [...] "rude, crude and deliciously wrong". The New Yorkers Nancy Franklin said that Family Guy is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity. The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after Saturday Night Live. IGN called Family Guy a great show, and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as Family Guy. Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented that one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> love the show is because nothing is sacred—it makes jokes and gags of almost everything. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as [...] "a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do." [...] Family Guy has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.|$|E
500|$|Grand Theft Auto IV sees a {{shift in}} the series to a more {{realistic}} and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser said [...] "what we're taking as our watchword on [...] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had." [...] Art director Aaron Garbut said one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> decided to set the game in New York because [...] "we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is," [...] and since they were hoping the push the [...] "detail, variety and life" [...] to a high level, it seemed that [...] "basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit." [...] Dan Houser added [...] "because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold." [...] The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City; Dan Houser said [...] "what we've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective." [...] The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series. Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IVs predecessor , Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when [...] "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings" [...] are taken into account. The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one {{at the start of the}} project (which was done with every previous Grand Theft Auto game) and another smaller one further into development. A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.|$|E
