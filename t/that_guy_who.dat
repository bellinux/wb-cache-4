500|$|Adams is {{generally}} {{less well known}} than many of America's other founding fathers. McCullough argued that [...] "he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him." [...] Todd Leopold of CNN added in 2001 that Adams is [...] "remembered as <b>that</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature {{seems to have been}} dwarfed by his lanky colleagues." [...] He has always been seen, Ferling says, as [...] "honest and dedicated," [...] but despite his lengthy career in public service, is still overshadowed by the dramatic explanations and strong personalities of his contemporaries. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as [...] "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow." [...] In his 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. In 1995, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling says that the man who emerges is one [...] "perpetually at war with himself," [...] whose desire for fame and recognition leads to changes of vanity. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that [...] "Adams was his own worst enemy." [...] He criticizes Adams for his [...] "pettiness...jealousy, and vanity," [...] and finds fault with him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. However, he praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled John Adams. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, [...] "plays down or explains away" [...] his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book was very favorably received and, along with other biographies published not long before, contributed to a rapid surge in Adams' reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Heraclius, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, and {{the grand}} masters of the Templars and Hospitallers tried to mediate a {{reconciliation}} between Baldwin IV and Guy of Lusignan, but the king did not forgive his brother-in-law. In October 1184, Guy made a plundering raid against the Bedouin tribes who grazed their herds in the royal domain of Deir al-Balah. This action outraged the king who soon convened the barons of the realm to an assembly and handed over [...] "the government of the kingdom and its general administration" [...] to Raymond, according to William of Tyre. However, Ernoul's chronicle and the Estoire de Eracles write that Baldwin IV decided to appoint a regent only after {{the members of the}} High Court had warned him <b>that</b> <b>Guy</b> (<b>who</b> was the minor Baldwin's stepfather) was still entitled to govern the kingdom after his death. The dying king requested them to name their candidate and they unanimously nominated Raymond. Baldwin IV accepted their choice and asked Raymond [...] "to act as regent of the kingdom and of the child for ten years until the child came of age", according to Ernoul's chronicle. Most sources failed to mention the date of these events, but a version of the Estoire de Eracles states that Raymond was made regent in 1185.|$|E

60|$|To be sure, he {{had only}} seen Elma once--that {{afternoon}} at the Holkers' garden-party. But, as Cyril himself knew, he {{had fallen in love}} with her at first sight--far more immediately, indeed, than even Cyril himself had done. Blood, as usual, was thicker than water. The points that appealed to one brother appealed also to the other, but with this characteristic difference, <b>that</b> <b>Guy,</b> <b>who</b> was the more emotional and less strong-willed of the two, yielded himself up at the very first glance to the beautiful stranger, while Cyril required some further acquaintance before quite giving way and losing his heart outright to her. And from that first meeting forward, Guy had carried Elma Clifford's image engraved upon his memory--as he would carry it, he believed, to his dying day. Not, to be sure, that he ever thought for a moment of endeavouring to win her away from his brother. She was Cyril's discovery, and to Cyril, therefore, he yielded her up, as of prior right, though with a pang of reluctance. But now that he stood face to face at last with his own accomplished crime, the first thought that rose in his mind spontaneous was for Elma's happiness. He must never let Elma Clifford know that the man she loved, and would doubtless marry, was now by HIS act--a forger's brother.|$|E

The results could only be 'yes' and 'no.' Dylan said yes. He came over to my house a few years back, and we sat down and started throwing ideas around. Bob came up with a melody/chordal pattern... I chimed in with a melody/chorus idea and voila, we had a song. Lyrics weren't written as yet. I demoed the track with Tommy Thayer. Bob came down to visit and listen. When the demo was done, I asked Bob to write the lyric. He said no, why don't I write it. I have tried to write a meaningful lyric, but it has eluded me. I've bumped into Bob a few times... in Tokyo, while he was on tour, and every time I ask him to write the lyric, and he always says, 'Mr. KISS, you write it.'
