5|$|The season {{chosen for}} leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure {{could be the}} anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety {{can also be seen}} in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to the}} king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E

500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} had some {{problems}} in filming some scenes.

[...] He further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>The</b> first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Three months later, the EPB {{issued a}} joint press release with the PRT and the PRTP announcing {{the death of}} one of its members, William Pintado Burgos. After {{emphasizing}} that he had joined the armed resistance from a young age as a believer in independence and socialism, the organizations proceeded to posthumously grant him the title of Commander of the Puerto Rican Revolution, which is only granted to those that are deemed to have [...] "stood firm and battled the motherland's enemy". Months later, on the birthday of Ramón Emeterio Betances, the EBP joined Jornada Betances in a homage to the Puerto Rican students involved in the protests against the Fortuño administration. Remembering that September 23, 1868, is now celebrated as [...] "the birth of the Puerto Rican nation", having been the date of the Cry of Lares when Betances and several other revolted against Spain and proclaimed the first Republic of Puerto Rico under Francisco Ramírez Medina, the group insisted that it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same as that day. Citing Pedro Albizu Campos's phrase [...] "it's difficult to give a speech while the mother is lying on bed and there is a killer prowling", the Macheteros anthropomorphized the influence of the United States as that murderer and labeled the Via Verde project and cases of government corruption as examples of actions being taken against the motherland, urging the public to mimic the actions of Lares. Blaming Fortuño, Figueroa Sancha and Fraticelli for a violent response to the UPR strike, the EPB congratulated the students for precipitating a negotiation procedure. Despite this, the organization urged the public to continue its resistance against the measures adopted by the Fortuño administration. The Macheteros also informed that they were [...] "gathering strength, preparing the stage and studying" [...] its opponents, quoting Betances' strategy of patiently and convertly planning every revolutionary action before executing them. The group stated that public education would be defended by [...] "an army of students and communities". The EBP concluded its statement by warning that [...] "the enemy was to be confronted with proper planning and intelligence [...] knowing when to strike". In lobbying for an unified national front, the Macheteros insisted that to accomplish independence {{the only way to do}} it was by following the armed resistance promoted by Betances, Albizu, Corretjer and Ojeda Ríos.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rod Smallwood, the band's manager, {{the brief}} given to Derek Riggs (the group's then regular artist) was, unlike with {{previous}} albums, to create [...] "simply something surreal and bloody weird".

2500|$|The {{recording}} {{schedule was}} so hurried {{that the group}} often did not even hear the playbacks. Page recalled, [...] "It was just so bloody rushed.

Yardbirds' chronicler Gregg Russo notes the result was that [...] "many [...] have a demo quality that time shortages would not allow them to change". In fact one song, the pop-ish [...] "Little Soldier Boy" [...] was issued with McCarty's rough vocal guide providing the part intended for a trumpet.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{tells the}} story of a young mother who lives a hectic life.

50|$|Flea control {{products}} are {{also part of}} grooming supplies. There is a wide variety of flea and tick control products that are applied to dogs while grooming.

2500|$|As {{the objects}} passed Mt Rainer, Arnold turned his plane southward {{on a more}} or less {{parallel}} course. It was at this point that he opened his side window and began observing the objects unobstructed by any glass that might have produced reflections. The objects did not disappear and continued to move very rapidly southward, continuously moving forward of his position. Curious about their speed, he began to time their rate of passage: he said they moved from Mt. Rainer to Mount Adams where they faded from view, a distance of about , in one minute and forty-two seconds, according to the clock on his instrument panel. When he later had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> calculation, the speed was over [...] This was about three times faster than any manned aircraft in 1947. Not knowing exactly the distance where the objects faded from view, Arnold conservatively and arbitrarily rounded this down to [...] an hour, still faster than any known aircraft, which had yet to break the sound barrier.
