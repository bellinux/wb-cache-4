Classical research has studied the energy-efficient operational strategy and the energy-efficient system design separately to reduce the traction energy consumption.

Firstly, a solution approach to the optimal train control model is introduced, {{which is used to}} design the Optimal Train Control Simulator(OTCS).

40|$|The {{integrated}} timetable {{and speed}} profile optimization model has recently attracted more attention {{because of its}} good achievements on energy conservation in metro systems. However, most previous studies often ignore the spatial and temporal uncertainties of <b>train</b> <b>mass,</b> and the variabilities of tractive force, braking force and basic running resistance on energy consumption {{in order to simplify}} the model formulation and solution algorithm. In this paper, we develop an integrated metro timetable and speed profile optimization model to minimize the total tractive energy consumption, where these real-world operating conditions are explicitly considered in the model formulation and solution algorithm. Firstly, we formulate a two-phase stochastic programming model to determine the timetable and speed profile. Given the speed profile, the first phase determines the timetable by scheduling the arrival and departure times for each station, and the second phase determines the speed profile for each inter-station with the scheduled arrival and departure times. Secondly, we design a simulation-based genetic algorithm procedure incorporated with the optimal train control algorithm to find the optimal solution. Finally, we present a simple example and a real-world example based on the operation data from the Beijing Metro Yizhuang Line in Beijing, China. The results of the real-world example show that, during peak hours, off-peak hours and night hours, the total tractive energy consumptions can be reduced by: (1) 10. 66 %, 9. 94 % and 9. 13 % in comparison with the current timetable and speed profile; and (2) 3. 35 %, 3. 12 % and 3. 04 % in comparison with the deterministic model.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the load of a railway line and {{the determination of the}} optimal number of trains (called “practical capacity”) require a valuation function which limits the load-dependant waiting times of trains. If a line section is considered, waiting times arise before trains enter the section and also along their course through the section, including stations and junctions along the way. Waiting times may be delays (operational) or scheduled. Existing attempts to measure operational quality on railway lines as an effect of the level of waiting times have relied on the subjective {{assessment of}} quality by operation professionals; more recently, economic approaches have been tried. In principle, productivity or profit parameters can be used for the microeconomic assessment. However, results can often be estimated only roughly and with difficulties due to the poor general availability of business data. Therefore, a new approach is taken in this thesis: the development of an easily applicable valuation function using parameters derived from physics (“physical parameters”) that are based on economic ones. The first way of developing the new valuation functions consists of testing the basic physical parameters towards their appropriateness for modelling the operation of railway lines in terms of quality and quantity. Through adequate combination of the appropriate basic parameters the physical parameters for the new valuation functions are derived. The second way starts with identifying the parameters that influence costs and revenues and assessing their relevance. Physical parameters are then used to describe the functional form of those economic parameters. The investigation shows that the costs mainly depend on the length of the line and the transport time. The transport time includes the scheduled transport time as well as operational waiting times (delays), which depend on the load of the line. In order to take account for the fact that different train types have different relevance for the total cost, the transport time of a train category is weighted by the sum of the masses of all trains of this category per time unit. The derived physical quantity is the weighted sum of transport times. The revenues mainly depend on the transport length, the transport volume and the reaction of transport demand relative to a base scenario. The transport volume is modelled by the <b>train</b> <b>mass,</b> and the changes in demand are represented by the reciprocal value of the transport time. The physical parameter for the revenues is therefore the product of mass and velocity, which is a momentum. While the weighting factors for each train category are taken into account, the momentums of all trains are added up. The resulting quantity is called transport momentum. Central parameters of the economic {{assessment of the}} load of a railway line are the profit and the productivity. The physical parameter describing the productivity is the quotient of the transport momentum and the weighted sum of transport times, called transport force. The physical parameter for modelling the profit is the difference between the physical quantities of revenues and costs and is called transport momentum difference. In order to validate the new approach, the functional form of each physical quantity was compared with the functional form of the corresponding economic quantity. Both the convergence at the limits of the domain and the shape of the curves in between were examined. Finally, the new approach was applied to several examples. The examples show that the new approach leads to values for the practical capacity which are slightly higher than those obtained by existing models, which tend to underestimate optimal train volumes. The new valuation algorithm is therefore suitable for assessing the impacts that changes in the infrastructure and of scheduled train programmes exert on capacity...|$|E
40|$|The rate {{at which}} a railway track deteriorates depends on the {{response}} of the track under different static and repeated dynamic forces. These wheel/rail forces lead to imperfections in the rail surface and deviation in track geometry alignment. The wheel/rail forces are dependent upon the quality of maintenance of the characteristics of both train and track. If train components such as wheelsets and suspensions are maintained to a high standard, less dynamic forces are generated at the wheel/rail interface and less damage is caused over time. Therefore, the amount and cost of maintenance of track are reduced. However, there is little known about how the characteristics of train components affect time-dependent track degradation. Track degradation through deviation of track from its ideal position has the most effect on maintenance costs. Therefore, the present research aims to investigate this track degradation and improve understanding of the effects of train characteristics (such as <b>train</b> <b>mass</b> and speed, suspension stiffness and damping) on railway tracks. The research is conducted by looking into the relationship between wheel/rail forces and track degradation on one hand and between wheel/rail forces and train characteristics on the other hand, with the objective of assisting in managing vehicle/track interaction in order to minimise track degradation. This aim is achieved by investigating the above two relationships to attain the desired relationship between track degradation and train characteristics. The research focuses on wheel/rail vertical forces (both amplitudes and frequencies), vertical track alignment (longitudinal vertical profile), and rail head defects. The study started by collecting wheel/rail vertical forces data in addition to data on vertical track degradation under sustained traffic loads on a heavy haul railway section of track in Central Queensland. Also, five years of degradation and maintenance history data were collected on three other test sections of railway track under variety of traffic conditions and loads in Central Queensland. There were four main analyses of this data employed to probe the study. The first analysis was performed by examining the track degradation history data. The standard deviation method was used in this first analysis to acquire the rate of deterioration in terms of its relationship to track profile (roughness). The second analysis was accomplished by correlating the vertical wheel/rail forces to both vertical track profile and rail roughness using signal processing principles and a function know as coherence. The third analysis was carried out by using the computer simulation software NUCARS to obtain the link between wheel/rail forces and the deterioration of the vertical track profile. The fourth analysis was achieved by combining the results obtained from the above three analyses to acquire the rate of track deterioration in terms of its relationship to varying train characteristics. The first analysis mentioned above quantified the relationship between the level of roughness of the track and {{rate at which}} that roughness deteriorated. An important outcome of this relationship {{is that there is a}} threshold of roughness below which track deterioration is minimal. The track maintenance planners can now use that threshold for cost effective targeting of tamping activities. The correlation study between track roughness and wheel/rail forces using the coherence function found, surprisingly, that the overall deterioration of the track roughness, in the absence of frequencies of forces above 30 Hz, is due to the so-called quasi-static lower frequency oscillations of dynamic forces. This conclusion together with the relationship between vehicle characteristics and track forces, established in the analyses above, has significant implications for the design of wagon bogies and for charges track owners might levy on trains using their tracks.

40|$|According to {{the current}} state of research, no basic method {{currently}} exists for mapping the economic efficiency of the rail system achieved by a specific track section, taking into account all the revenues and costs of rail traffic companies (RTC) and rail infrastructure companies (RIC) for arbitrary track occupation rates. However, in order to establish the optimum performance range from an economic point of view and be able to efficiently evaluate infra-structure measures so as to improve operations, it is necessary to look at all the revenues and costs {{as a function of the}} offer quality. In this dissertation, a model approach is therefore developed that creates on the one hand a relationship between the technical design of the railway infrastructure, the operational program conducted with this infrastructure and the accompanying infrastructure utilisation, and, on the other, the attained transport quality and its effect on the customers. For this purpose, the revenues and costs of RTCs and RICs are analysed with the help of four submodels and inserted in the overall model as a function of the number of trains running on a particular section of track. The revenues from transport charges obtained by RTCs are determined with the help of traffic generation and traffic demand models as a function of the number of trains running. The offer quality of a particular track section is then related to the change in demand of the customers and to the competitive situation with other means of transport in order to be able to document the reaction in demand of travelling customers and the associated changes in revenues. The revenue model of the RIC takes into account the revenues from track and station charges and traction energy sales. The track and station charges are entered in the model as a function of the respective track and station category. The energy consumption of the rail vehicles is taken into account as a function of the <b>train</b> <b>mass,</b> speed, number of acceleration processes, length of track covered, and track topology. To determine the costs of RTC, a life cycle cost model was developed that considers the investment, maintenance and energy costs of rail vehicles, the personnel costs of the train staff and the costs for track and station charges. The time-dependent cost components are included as a function of the capacity utilisation-dependent transportation time in the model in order to be able to document the effects of capacity utilisation-dependent waiting times on the RTC costs. To model the RIC costs, a life cycle cost model was developed for the railway infrastructure that takes into account the investment, maintenance and operating costs of individual infra-structure elements. Depending on the technical equipment of the examined track, the relevant overall costs of the infrastructure can be calculated for the period covered by the study. A large proportion of the infrastructure costs was entered in the model as fixed costs. For rails, points and overhead contact lines, the wear-dependent maintenance costs were incorporated in the model in relation to the number, speed and mass of the trains in operation. With the aid of the four described submodels, the income and costs of RTC and RIC achieved on a track section are determined. Through a comparison of the total revenues and total costs, the economic performance range of the track section can be obtained, within which a positive economic result is achieved and which is limited by the break-even numbers of trains. Within the economic performance range, the economically optimum number of trains occurs at the point with the largest difference between revenues and costs. In contrast to the previously used quality standards for determining the optimum track utilisation, this approach does not require any previous calibration of threshold values. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate infrastructure measures with regard to their effects on the economically optimum performance range and the attained economic result. Via a comparison of the actual number of trains in operation and the economically optimum performance range of the section of track in question, infrastructure measures can be evaluated in respect of how they contribute to an increase in the economic efficiency of a track section by shifting the economically optimum performance range. The economic success of the measure can be defined by the revenues and cost calculation based on monetary values. This creates a basis for decision-making with which strategies for infrastructure expansion and the efficiency of previous funding can be evaluated...|$|E
