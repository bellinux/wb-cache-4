After decades of wars against the House of Habsburg, the public debt stood at 48 million livres, while the king had only 12 million livres in annual income. <b>The</b> <b>Guises</b> implemented a policy of austerity intended to improve the country's financial situation, but this contributed mightily to their unpopularity. They also delayed paying military personnel, the king's officials, and court suppliers. They reduced {{the size of the}} army, and many soldiers became unemployed. Frustrations mounted at court, as the cutbacks spared the regiments under the control of <b>the</b> <b>Guises</b> and their friends.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Guises</b> {{were seen}} by many as lacking legitimacy. To their adversaries, they were merely ambitious foreigners from Lorraine. Their father Claude, Duke of <b>Guise,</b> was <b>the</b> son of René II, Duke of Lorraine, who had been accorded French {{citizenship}} by King Francis I, his military companion. The main criticism against <b>the</b> <b>Guises</b> was that they were taking advantage of the king's youth to wield power arbitrarily. An opposition movement led by the Prince of the Blood Antoine of Navarre, King of Navarre, contested their power. Some theorists, such as François Hotman, believed that the law entitled the latter to be the king's senior adviser since he was a descendant of Louis IX of France and thus an heir to the throne if the House of Valois then in power disappeared. However, Antoine failed to prevail against <b>the</b> <b>Guises</b> when he came to court.|$|R

Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E

The Protestants looked for leadership first to Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, the First Prince of the Blood, and then, with more success, to his brother, Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force. When the Guises heard of the plot, they moved the court to the fortified Château of Amboise. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the château. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many {{of them on the}} spot, including the commander, La Renaudie. Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed in <b>the</b> <b>guise</b> of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries.

Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E

The researchers posit that, while video game play may be controversial due to frequently graphic content, harnessing the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, who face cognitive decline) and is therefore socially relevant.|$|E
