5|$|On 7 January 1904 Joyce {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> <b>A</b> Portrait of the Artist, an essay-story {{dealing with}} aesthetics, {{only to have}} it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana.

It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.|$|E

Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, and they did not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E

He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E

5|$|After {{developing}} Gunstar Heroes, Treasure {{was divided}} into four teams to work on four separate projects: Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, , and Dynamite Headdy. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, served as head programmer on Dynamite Headdy. After deciding <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> <b>a</b> localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa was told by Sega of America to make the game more difficult. This was because Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as difficult. In addition to changes in difficulty, most of the dialogue in the game was removed, {{and several of the}} character and boss sprites were changed.|$|E
5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> <b>a</b> biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> <b>a</b> {{comic book}} he wrote titled Everyman, {{in which the}} title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E
