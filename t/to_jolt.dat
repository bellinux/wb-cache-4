500|$|In a mixed review, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone was {{impressed}} by its music, but found Cudi's raps [...] "pedestrian". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork gave the album a negative review, finding it frustrating that the album felt like a failed opportunity rather than a [...] "non-starter". He further wrote that Cudi largely smears his verses with a [...] "flat warble" [...] that is salvaged by Auto-Tune, which he remarked would be [...] "numbing enough on its own" [...] {{had it not been}} for the frequent [...] "terrifyingly underwritten lyric <b>to</b> <b>jolt</b> you into sharp pangs of embarrassment." [...] In a largely mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times expressed his astonishment at the emotional honesty embedded into Cudi's songwriting but felt his restrained vocal performance diminished his presence on the album, writing, that the album [...] "is a colossal, and mystifying, missed opportunity, misguided if it is in fact guided at all." [...] Citing the tracks [...] "Solo Dolo" [...] and on [...] "Cudi Zone" [...] as Cudi's most [...] "appealingly creepy" [...] and intricate vocal performance, on his general view of the album, Caramanica wrote that the rest of the album lacks that liveliness and drive, reducing Cudi to a [...] "gaseous nonentity".|$|E
500|$|Pallas {{returned}} on 12 May with [...] and a 16-gun ship-sloop, [...] Allemande despatched {{two large}} frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, Pallas and Kingfisher {{came back and}} Allemande again ordered Minerve, Lynx, Sylphe, and Palinure to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, [...] and , cleared for action and ready to go. Collett ordered his ships to set all sail {{in the hope of}} catching Pallas before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his topsails and slowing down. Once in range, Pallas opened fire, bringing down the topsail yard of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby shoals with Minerve in pursuit. By 13:00 Minerve had come up on the leeward side of Pallas, whereupon Pallas fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. Just at that moment, Minerve hit a sandbank and Pallas crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough <b>to</b> <b>jolt</b> Pallass guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but Pallass shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, Armide and Infatigable, drawing near. The crew of Kingfisher sailed in to take Pallas in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, jib-boom, spritsail, stunsail, and main topsail yards. Minerve was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard Minerve, with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard Pallas.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{reviewed}} the episode positively. John Saavedra of Den of Geek! gave it {{four out of}} five stars: [...] "Anyone hoping for an incredibly bloody hour of murder and mutilation the likes of which we'd never seen before on The Walking Dead should be pretty pleased with the season 7 premiere". Steve Wright of SciFiNow gave the episode a five-out-of-five rating in his review: [...] "Sometimes, shows need a game-changing moment <b>to</b> <b>jolt</b> the formula and stop things from getting samey. If any show was in such dire need of one, it was The Walking Dead, and it has definitely got that. Welcome back." [...] Mick van Hesteren of IGN Benelux rated it 10 out of 10 and called it a [...] "meesterwerk".|$|E

2500|$|The {{second season}} saw {{critical}} acclaim. Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker stated [...] "Bad is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking <b>to</b> <b>jolt</b> Walt {{out of his}} suburban stupor, to experience life again—to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad." [...] San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman claimed [...] "The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, {{it looks as if}} Gilligan's bold vision for Breaking Bad, now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode." [...] Horror novelist Stephen King lauded the series, comparing it to the likes of Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet.|$|E
2500|$|One of the earliest, {{and one of}} {{the most}} famous {{critical}} disparagements of the play occurred in 1678, in the introduction to Edward Ravenscroft's theatrical adaptation, Titus Andronicus, or the Rape of Lavinia. A Tragedy, Alter'd from Mr. Shakespeare's Works. Speaking of the original play, Ravenscroft wrote, [...] "'tis the most incorrect and indigested piece in all his works. It seems rather a heap of rubbish than a structure." [...] In 1765, Samuel Johnson questioned the possibility of even staging the play, pointing out that [...] "the barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any audience." [...] In 1811, August Wilhelm Schlegel wrote that the play was [...] "framed according to a false idea of the tragic, which by an accumulation of cruelties and enormities, degenerated into the horrible and yet leaves no deep impression behind." [...] In 1927, T.S. Eliot famously argued that it was [...] "one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written, a play in which it is incredible that Shakespeare had any hand at all, a play in which the best passages would be too highly honoured by the signature of Peele." [...] In 1948, John Dover Wilson wrote that the play [...] "seems <b>to</b> <b>jolt</b> and bump along like some broken-down cart, laden with bleeding corpses from an Elizabethan scaffold, and driven by an executioner from Bedlam dressed in cap and bells." [...] He goes on to say that if the play had been by anyone other than Shakespeare, it would have been lost and forgotten; it is only because tradition holds that Shakespeare wrote it (which Dover Wilson highly suspects) that it is remembered, not for any intrinsic qualities of its own.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Randy Lewis of Los Angeles Times gave the song a positive review stating [...] "self-confidence {{is in full}} flower in 'Put It in a Love Song,' her effervescent duet with Beyoncé that has 'hit single' written all over it." [...] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated [...] "Keys also teams with Beyoncé, the glittery Diana Ross to Keys's [...] super-serious poetry major, for the disc's best track, 'Put It in a Love Song.' 'Love Song' is an oddly mechanical number that lurches from diva to diva but somehow doesn't fall over..." [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH called {{it one of the}} album's [...] "standout moments", describing it as having [...] "the Sasha Fierce brashness" [...] and that [...] "the always fantastic Beyoncé takes a notable backseat to Keys for a delightful and surprising change of pace". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website Allmusic chose [...] "Put It in a Love Song" [...] as one of the three best songs on The Element of Freedom and commennted, [...] "On The Element of Freedom, that elegance is so easy it borders on the sleepy, with Keys' understatement undercutting livelier numbers -- chief among them the bubbly Beyoncé duet 'Put It in a Love Song' -- so they play as ballads." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin also chose the song as a highlight on the whole album. Gary Graff of Billboard magazine described the song as a [...] "girl-power anthem". A writer of The New York Times felt that the song gives the album [...] "bristle with a less regal impulse: flirting". The writer further commented that the song had a [...] "quantitatively different energy, air-lifted from somewhere else". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, [...] "Beyoncé nearly manages <b>to</b> <b>jolt</b> Keys out of her midtempo comfort zone on 'Put In A Love Song', encouraging 'A' to show her sassy side over bootyshakin' Swiss Beatz rhythms." [...] Ron Wynn of The City Paper noted that Keys matches Knowles [...] "in force and attitude" [...] on the song.|$|E

40|$|The {{meaning and}} use of the term “transformation ” varies so widely with differing audiences and stake holders (see Ratz 1982; Khosa 1999; Mwamwenda 1999; Vera 1999) that a {{clarification}} of its meaning is considered an essential starting point for this paper. Transformation is here differentiated from general change. It goes beyond reorganization and restructuring; it is more than reformation. While an alternation or modification of any component Daniel Obikeze. of a phenomenon inaugurates a change, “transformation entails creating something new or different through the configuration or remolding of the constituent elements of the old ” (Obikeze 2003 : 1). In contrast to change, transformation is generally more revolutionary, more expeditious, and more prone <b>to</b> <b>jolting</b> and convulsive experiences. As Smart (1992 : 170) has put it, transformation is “rapid and at times cataclysmic forms of change. ” In the context of this paper, the term “academy ” refers to the system of higher education in general and specifically to the university education system.

60|$|The rest of {{the night}} wore away in the usual manner. Mr Pecksniff and Old Anthony kept {{tumbling}} against each other and waking up much terrified, or crushed their heads in opposite corners of the coach and strangely tattooed the surface of their faces--Heaven knows how--in their sleep. The coach stopped and went on, and went on and stopped, times out of number. Passengers got up and passengers got down, and fresh horses came and went and came again, with scarcely any interval between each team as it seemed to those who were dozing, and with a gap of a whole night between every one as it seemed to those who were broad awake.

6000|$|Now {{what is the}} {{difference}} between this and the examples from Warner and Morris which I have just quoted? Simply that the comparison turning upon the word true, the mind is satisfied, because the analogy between the word as used morally and as used physically is so perfect as to leave no gap for the reasoning faculty <b>to</b> <b>jolt</b> over. But it is precisely this jolt, not so violent as to be displeasing, violent enough to discompose our thoughts with an agreeable sense of surprise, which it is the object of a pun to give us.

[...] Dean Swift's famous question to the man carrying the hare, [...] "Pray, sir, is that your own hare or a wig?" [...] is perfect in its way.
