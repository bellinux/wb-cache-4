2500|$|Erumbeeswarar Temple (எறும்பீஸ்வரர் கோயில்) in Thiruverumbur, Tamil Nadu, India, is a Hindu temple {{dedicated}} to the deity Shiva. Built on a [...] tall hill, it is accessible via a flight of steps. The temple's main shrines and its two prakarams (outer courtyards) are {{on top of the}} hill, while a hall and the temple tank are located at the foothills. Shiva is believed to have transformed himself into an ant hill and <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> head at this place to enable ants to climb up and worship him. Erumbeeswarar is revered in the canonical 7th-century Tamil Saiva work the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{the role}} for Empire lasted three weeks. The actor {{was pleased with}} the costume and used it to convey the character's menace. Bulloch based his {{performance}} on Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the gun prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> head, and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that [...] "the less you do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes". Playing Fett in Empire was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role.|$|E
2500|$|About {{the year}} 1774 William Herschel (then {{a teacher of}} music in Bath, England) began to occupy his leisure hours with the {{construction}} of reflector telescope mirrors, finally devoted himself entirely to their construction and use in astronomical research. In 1778, he selected a [...] reflector mirror (the best of some 400 telescope mirrors which he had made) and with it, built a [...] focal length telescope. Using this telescope, he made his early brilliant astronomical discoveries. In 1783, Herschel completed a reflector of approximately [...] in diameter and [...] focal length. He observed the heavens with this telescope for some twenty years, replacing the mirror several times. In 1789 Herschel finished building his largest reflecting telescope with a mirror of [...] and a focal length of , (commonly known as his 40-foot telescope) at his new home, at Observatory House in Slough, England. To cut down on the light loss from the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror from his design and <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This design has come to be called the Herschelian telescope. He discovered Saturn's sixth known moon, Enceladus, the first night he used it (August 28, 1789), and on September 17, its seventh known moon, Mimas. This telescope was world's largest telescope for over 50 years. However, this large scope was difficult to handle and thus less used than his favorite 18.7-inch reflector.|$|E
