5|$|Owing {{to several}} {{academic}} commitments, work on Theory of Literature {{did not begin}} until 1945, after Wellek and Warren received a stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation {{over a period of}} <b>two</b> <b>summers.</b> Wellek and Warren began dividing their responsibilities, at first evenly, but with more work done by Wellek as Warren dealt with the illness, and later loss, of his wife Eleanor in 1946. During this period of writing Wellek transferred to Yale University (1946) and Warren to the University of Michigan (1948), but collaboration continued.|$|E
5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following <b>two</b> <b>summers</b> uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E

5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for <b>two</b> <b>summers</b> that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because {{he was the only one}} who confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, <b>two</b> <b>summers</b> {{before the}} Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|In 1950-51, he hit 490 runs at {{an average}} of 37.69, {{including}} 100 not out against New South Wales at the SCG. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, and did not play a single first-class match in 1952-53. His only other first-class centuries came in 195354: 102 against South Australia and 111 against Western Australia. He struggled in the following <b>two</b> <b>summers</b> and could not hold a consistent position in the team, and retired. Altogether, he made 1,716 first-class runs (mostly as an opener) in 37 matches {{at an average}} of 27.23. A regular choice for the Queensland baseball team, Harvey later turned to cricket umpiring. His initial first-class match as an umpire was in 1974-75 and he stood in two Tests from 1979 to 1980 after many players and officials left for the breakaway World Series Cricket. He stood in six One Day Internationals including one of the finals of the inaugural World Series Cup. In all, he officiated in 31 first-class and 13 List A matches.|$|E

5|$|A left-arm medium-pacer, Toshack {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket {{debut in the}} 1945–46 upon the resumption of cricket after World War II. His performances were enough to ensure his selection for the tour of New Zealand in early-1946, where Toshack made his Test debut in the one-off match against the hosts' national team. From then on, Toshack was a regular {{member of the national}} team and played in every Test over the next <b>two</b> <b>summers,</b> fitness permitting. Toshack played in eight of the 11 Tests during this period, taking 36 wickets. Towards the end of the Test series against India in 1947–48 in Australia, knee injuries began to hamper Toshack, and he was in doubt for the 1948 tour of England. He only made the trip after a 3–2 majority vote by a medical panel, despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Two Melbourne doctors ruled him unfit, but three specialists from his home state of New South Wales presented a more optimistic outlook; this allowed him to tour. As a member of Bradman's Invincibles, the tour was to immortalise him in cricketing history. He grew tired of signing autographs during the sea voyage to England, and entrusted a friend with the task. However, his friend was unaware of the correct spelling of his name; as a result, there are still sheets in circulation signed Toshak. The team manager Keith Johnson gave Toshack a talking to over this incident.|$|E

During his first summer break, Stewart returned to his hometown to work as a brick loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs where he painted lines on the roads.

25|$|The {{captaincy}} {{was given}} back to him, briefly, in August 1975 when Roy Virgin's reign ended after three months. Watts promptly broke a finger and Mushtaq inherited the job. But {{he received the}} call again {{at the end of}} 1977 with the club in turmoil as the committee crossed swords with several key players, including the outgoing captain. At the subsequent Extraordinary General meeting, held just before Christmas, Watts took his place on the platform to face the members, some of whom had formed themselves into an Action Group to demand, at the very least, a full explanation of all the behind-the-scenes machinations. The next <b>two</b> <b>summers</b> saw his Northamptonshire team reach the Gillette Cup final, win the Benson & Hedges Cup (with Watts' tactical acumen seen to best advantage in an absorbing semi-final struggle against Mike Brearley's Middlesex at Lord's), and drag itself off the bottom of the Championship table.|$|E
25|$|His newly {{discovered}} prowess at soccer did not detract from his cricketing skills. The <b>two</b> <b>summers</b> in which Woods played for Brighton College were strong ones for the school, of the 23 matches they played, only 2 were lost. Alongside the Woods brothers {{were a number}} of other players who would go on to appear in county cricket; George Cotterill and George Wilson both played for Sussex, while Leslie Gay made one Test appearance for England in addition to representing Hampshire and Somerset. Woods topped the bowling averages in both his years at the school; in the first he claimed 59 wickets at an average just over eight, figures which he improved upon during his second year when he took 78 wickets at an average of 7.3. His college reports commented much more favourably on his sporting achievements than his academic ones, praising his batting, bowling and fielding alike.|$|E
