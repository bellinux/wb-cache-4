5|$|Beginning on February 25, 2008, I-75 closed {{completely}} to traffic {{in both directions}} from Rosa Parks Boulevard (exit49) to Clark Street (exit47) in Detroit. This facilitated the complete rebuilding of the road {{as part of the}} Ambassador Gateway Project to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the Ambassador Bridge. Through traffic on I-75 was rerouted along I-94 to I-275 and local detours were posted. The freeway reopened to traffic in June 2009, five months ahead of schedule. The overall project to realign and connect the bridge to the freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company <b>that</b> <b>owns</b> <b>the</b> bridge. The company's owner was jailed for contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on February 25, 2008, MDOT and the Detroit International Bridge Company {{initiated}} the Ambassador Gateway Project {{at the eastern}} end of I-96.

That segment of I-96 closed on July 14, 2008, and it was scheduled to reopen a month early the following September.

5|$|On 8 May 2013, Ferguson {{announced}} that he was to retire as manager {{at the end of the}} football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96. They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.

5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings <b>that</b> <b>owns</b> <b>the</b> paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E

25|$|Street sign theft {{occurs when}} street signs are stolen, often {{to be used}} as decorations, but also {{sometimes}} to avoid obeying the law by claiming later the sign was not there.

Sometimes considered to be a prank by the perpetrators, the theft is often costly and inconveniencing for the municipality or agency <b>that</b> <b>owns</b> <b>the</b> sign. In the United States, each street sign generally costs between $100 and $500 to replace.|$|E

Following investigations, firefighters determined that an unknown person had thrown fuel on the wooden terrace, and then set it on fire.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the overall}} manager or chief {{executive}} of the newspaper is the publisher. In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation <b>that</b> <b>owns</b> <b>the</b> publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer. Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself—editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names—as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.|$|E

25|$|Co-ownership co-ops are {{generally}} older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one voting {{share in the}} corporation <b>that</b> <b>owns</b> <b>the</b> building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their share certificate. Most {{of these types of}} co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by private sale or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with home equity who could buy the unit outright, as it was difficult to get a mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario credit unions are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units affordable housing options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.|$|E
