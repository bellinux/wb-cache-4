5|$|T. m. caurinus breeds in {{southeast}} Alaska through coastal British Columbia to Washington and northwest Oregon. It winters from southwest British Columbia south to {{central and southern}} California and east to northern Idaho. It is very slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and very dark-headed. The white on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer two tail feathers is restricted.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has four}} main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, solid red of various shades. Red {{includes}} sable (red where <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay).|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part}} of the wooden core of the bow.|$|E

5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ears.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toes.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
2500|$|The Nāsāgre dṛṣṭi ( [...] ; meaning [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose") has {{the eyes}} fixed on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose. Purportedly {{strengthens}} the eye muscles.|$|R
50|$|Head: Roundish to {{slightly}} oval, substantial, wide. Arched forehead that flows in a smooth, continuous curve from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beak to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peak. Wattle small and neat.|$|R
5000|$|Voiced apical coronal trill/tap , either {{alveolar}} (articulated with <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue {{against the}} alveolar ridge), or dental (articulated with <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue against <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper front teeth).|$|R
5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} tightly packed) is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The fibrous layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.|$|E
5|$|The spores are hyaline (translucent), smooth, and {{ellipsoid}} {{with the}} ends truncate. They have dimensions of 11.5–20 by 5–9µm, and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous cells interspersed among the asci, or spore-producing cells) are 5–8µm wide at the tip, branched, septate (with partitions that divide the cells into compartments), and constricted at the septa. The asci are cylindrical, and measure 300–360 by 10–13µm; <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asci stain blue with Melzer's reagent. The finely cylindrical paraphyses have slightly swollen tips and are forked at the base.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{variable}} {{is whether the}} contact occurs with <b>the</b> very <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue (an apical articulation [...] ). With the surface just above <b>the</b> <b>tip,</b> <b>the</b> blade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue (a laminal articulation [...] ),or with <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> (a subapical articulation). Apical and subapical articulations are always [...] "tongue-up", with <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue above the teeth, and laminal articulations are often [...] "tongue-down", with <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue behind the lower teeth.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece and <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reed {{is known as}} <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> opening. <b>The</b> <b>tip</b> opening has little effect on tone, which is more affected by <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece's chamber (interior space).|$|R

5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized {{within a few days}} of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
25|$|Dorsiflexion (extension) and plantar flexion occur {{around the}} {{transverse}} axis {{running through the}} ankle joint from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial malleolus to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral malleolus. Pronation (eversion) and supination (inversion) occur along <b>the</b> oblique axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ankle joint.|$|R
30|$|We {{used the}} tip-apex {{distance}} to assess differences in position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implants. Tip-apex distance is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lag screw to <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head on an anteroposterior radiograph and this distance on a lateral radiograph, {{after controlling for}} magnification. For the SHS, we used <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sliding screw {{as a point of}} measurement, while for the dual screw cephalomedullary nails, we used <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal screw as a point of measurement.|$|R
5000|$|Total length (TL) is <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> a fish {{measured}} from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer lobe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal fin, usually measured with the lobes compressed along the midline. It is a straight-line measure, not measured over <b>the</b> curve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|R
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
5|$|While {{features}} of the limbs indicate that aetosaurs probably dug for food, {{features of}} the skull and teeth can indicate what kind of food they were eating. Aetosaurs have many derived features not seen in other crurotarsans, which indicate that they are adapted to a different diet. Unlike the sharp, recurved teeth of other triassic archosaurs, aetosaurs had simple, conical teeth. <b>The</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaws were edentulous, or toothless, and probably supported a beak. The teeth have very little wear, suggesting that aetosaurs did not consume stiff and tough plant material. It {{is more likely that}} they consumed non-abrasive vegetation such as soft leaves.|$|E
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first dorsal fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second dorsal fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey to bronze above, darkening at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first dorsal fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{peninsula}} {{region is}} dry and contains {{resources such as}} salt mines and a significant oil field at Ancón. <b>The</b> settlement <b>of</b> Chinchipe is <b>the</b> closest settlement to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula; it is served by Ecuador Highway 70, which extends to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula.|$|R
30|$|We {{presented}} a sixth finger system composed of an extra robotic thumb {{attached to the}} left hand, that simulates a second thumb in that hand and has a force sensor in its tip; a thumb motion capture, that attaches to the right hand, and captures the movements and position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thumb in that hand, to mirror its movements into the extra robotic thumb. And a electrostimulation device that provides pseudo tactile feedback from the force sensor on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robotic thumb to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right thumb.|$|R
50|$|The tooth size {{increased}} towards <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout, like in sauropods. Another derived, sauropod like feature was a bony {{plate that}} lined the tooth row laterally and became thicker towards <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout. This plate may have hindered the teeth to be displaced while defoliating plants.|$|R
5|$|Sinosauropteryx was anatomically {{similar to}} Compsognathus, differing from its European {{relatives}} in its proportions. The skull of Sinosauropteryx was 15% longer than its thigh bones, unlike in Compsognathus, where {{the skull and}} thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of Sinosauropteryx (humerus and radius) were only 30% the length of its legs (thigh bone and shin), compared to 40% in Compsognathus. Additionally, Sinosauropteryx had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 vertebrae in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod. Its hands were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% {{of the length of}} the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit. The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of the forearm. The teeth differed slightly (they were heterodont) based on position: those near <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper jaws (on the premaxillae) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the maxillae) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{positioned}} well {{back on the}} body, closer to the pelvic than the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are large, about half to three-quarters {{as high as the}} first dorsal fin. The broad, triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before the level of the fifth gill slit. There is no ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is half the length of the upper, which has a strong notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, usually with 7 horizontal ridges, giving the skin a smooth feel. The coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below, with a pattern of scattered small, dark spots unique to each individual. <b>The</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe, and sometimes also the second dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe, are bright white.|$|E
5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E
