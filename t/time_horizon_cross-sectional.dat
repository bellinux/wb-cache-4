40|$|Abstract The {{footwear}} {{industry in}} Banten Province {{is facing the}} issues of low business performance {{in the last five}} years caused by an inappropriate competitive strategy and business partnership that is not close yet. This research aims to study about business partnerships and competitive strategy on business performance of footwear industry in the Province of Banten. The study is conducted by descriptive and explanatory survey methods. The unit of analysis are companies of footwear industry in Banten Province. <b>Time</b> <b>horizon</b> is <b>cross-sectional</b> which the study was conducted at a time simultaneously. The hypotheses is tested by using PLS. The finding of the study reveals that the companys management of footwear industry in the Province of Banten does not have a close partnership yet and have not been implement appropriate competitive strategy yet to improve their business partnership. There is simultaneous influence of business partnership and competitive strategy on business performance.

In contrast with behavioral biases conjectured specifically to explain the puzzle, overconfidence is a well-documented psychological phenomenon that {{has been found to be}} consistent with several trading and return patterns in securities markets. In our model, overconfident individuals overreact to their information about future inflation. The spot rate and forward discount differentially reflect such overreaction; as a result, the forward discount forecasts reversal in the spot rate. The model predicts how the forward discount bias varies with <b>time</b> <b>horizon,</b> time-series versus <b>cross-sectional</b> test method, and shifts in volume and volatility. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the business models being used by medical aid societies in order to survive in a turbulent economic environment experienced by Zimbabwe between 2005 and 2013. The turbulent economic environment caused operational difficulties for most medical aid societies like failure to meet claims costs, diversification into questionable non core activities and skyrocketing costs of doing business. These challenges threatened the long term survival of societies, therefore the study delved deep to understand what can be done to guarantee long term survival of the societies. The research followed a positivist or quantitative research philosophy. A deductive approach was used. The study used a survey research strategy and the <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> was <b>cross-sectional</b> as opposed to longitudinal. The study had a population of about 36 650 people and a sample of 200 people received questionnaires. The respondents were split across medical aid subscribers, employees, shareholders and managers of various medical aid societies. The sample was arrived at using the stratified random and convenience sampling techniques. The study relied on primary sources of data. Collected data was analyzed by the SPSS software. Medical aid societies are following efficiency based business models which lack robust value chains. They are not providing services that meet customer expectations as shown by 40...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} {{and tests}} {{a conceptual framework}} on the relationships between competition, <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> and corporate social performance (CSP). We hypothesize that more intense competition discourages CSP by lowering the <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> of companies. We test the hypothesis on a sample of 4696 of mainly {{small and medium-sized companies}} from twelve European countries. We distinguish between price competition, market position and technological competition. We find that companies with a longer <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> have a higher CSP and that price competition and a ‘level playing field’ market position shorten the <b>time</b> <b>horizon.</b> The intensity of technological competition has a positive effect on <b>time</b> <b>horizon,</b> but also exerts a direct positive influence on CSP. Test results show that <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> significantly mediates the influence of price competition, the market position and technological competition on CSP. The analysis implies that, from the perspective of CSP, the economic policy of the government should not focus on fostering price competition, but rather on strengthening competition in innovation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Receding horizon control {{strategies}} have proven effective in many control and robotic applications. These methods simulate the state a certain <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> {{into the future}} to choose the optimal trajectory. However, in many cases, such as in mobile robot navigation, the selection of an appropriate <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> is important as too long of a <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> can amplify the detrimental effects caused by environmental uncertainties in the prediction of the future state while too of a short horizon will lead to reduced performance. In this paper we {{strike a balance between}} these two conflicting objectives by first introducing a receding horizon method for navigation founded on schema-based behaviors. We then suggest a method of adapting the <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> by minimizing a cost function which balances the performance of the underlying control problem (which prefers longer horizons) with the performance of our state prediction (which prefers shorter <b>time</b> <b>horizons).</b> We illustrate the operation with an example which shows the usefulness of our navigation scheme with an adaptive <b>time</b> <b>horizon.</b> I...|$|R
