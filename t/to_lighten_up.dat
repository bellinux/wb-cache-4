5|$|Final Fantasy V was {{directed}} by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior {{to the release of}} Final Fantasy IX, called it his favorite Final Fantasy game. The character, image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from Final Fantasy V and Terra from Final Fantasy VI among his favorite Final Fantasy designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> <b>up</b> the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16Mbits of space were used to accommodate for the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to GamePro in a May1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class to wait in line for the game.|$|E

In 1970, Raphy Leavitt {{organized}} a band with an original sound and style that became one of Puerto Rico's greatest salsa orchestras, [...] "La Selecta". [...] He selected the band's repertoire from songs with a particular, positive social message and philosophy, and arranged his new band's sound to be as raw and powerful as the typical all-trombone salsa sound in vogue at the time. This genre was made popular by Willie Colón, but La Selecta featured the addition of trumpets <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> <b>up</b> the sound melodically. Brenda K. Starr is a salsa singer who in 2002 won two Latin Grammy Awards, one for [...] "Best Salsa Album", for [...] "Temptation" [...] {{and the other in}} the category [...] "Best Salsa Single" [...] for [...] "Por Ese Hombre".

[...] His brother, Theo van Gogh (art dealer) had asked him often <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> <b>up</b> his work, referring {{to the work of}} the Impressionists.

Judah attacked Meeting Soviet Man for being too sympathetic to the west, and too critical of the Soviet Union. I recall one particularly tense meeting at Judah's house. <b>To</b> <b>lighten</b> <b>up</b> the atmosphere he spent the first hour regaling us with colorful stories about the professional boxing bouts he attended in Melbourne's old Festival Hall.

Triet definitely has a knack for creating uncomfortable situations that go from bad to awful, only <b>to</b> suddenly <b>lighten</b> <b>up</b> in the interim, and although she can’t quite sustain things for feature length, the film’s smart setup and ambitious shooting tactics make for a highly watchable affair." ...|$|R

60|$|After so {{formidable}} {{a list of}} {{what one}} can't find in a German daily, the question may well be asked, What CAN be found in it? It is easily answered: A child's handful of telegrams, mainly about European national and international political movements; letter-correspondence about the same things; market reports. There you have it. That is what a German daily is made of. A German daily is the slowest and saddest and dreariest of the inventions of man. Our own dailies infuriate the reader, pretty often; the German daily only stupefies him. Once a week the German daily of the highest class lightens up its heavy columns--that is, it thinks it lightens them up--with a profound, an abysmal, book criticism; a criticism which carries you down, down, down into the scientific bowels of the subject--for the German critic is nothing if not scientific--and when you come up at last and scent the fresh air and see the bonny daylight once more, you resolve without a dissenting voice that a book criticism is a mistaken way <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> <b>up</b> a German daily. Sometimes, in place of the criticism, the first-class daily gives you what it thinks is a gay and chipper essay--about ancient Grecian funeral customs, or the ancient Egyptian method of tarring a mummy, or the reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed before the flood did not approve of cats. These are not unpleasant subjects; they are not uninteresting subjects; they are even exciting subjects--until one of these massive scientists gets hold of them. He soon convinces you that even these matters can be handled {{in such a way as}} to make a person low-spirited.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding Dille's {{script for}} Fievel Goes West, critic Cliff Terry wrote, [...] "Screenwriter Flint Dille has {{provided}} {{a story that is}} frenetic and fast-paced—in the end, too hyper, too cluttered—with some decidedly dark touches that, conceivably, could have undertones of the Holocaust. <b>To</b> <b>lighten</b> things <b>up,</b> Dille periodically tosses in bits of relatively sophisticated humor. At one point, the desert is described as 'a million-acre catbox,' there are references to espresso and endive, and when Miss Kitty cuts out on Tiger, she purrs—Casablanca-like: 'We'll always have the Bronx. Here's lookin' at you, kid.'" ...|$|R

500|$|In October 2006, Peter Berg was {{attached}} to direct Tonight, He Comes with production slated to begin in May 2007 in Los Angeles, the story's setting. Berg had been midway through filming The Kingdom {{when he heard about}} the film and called Michael Mann, who had become one of its producers. The new director compared the original script's tone to Leaving Las Vegas (1995), calling it [...] "a scathing character study of this suicidal alcoholic superhero".

[...] Carl Wilson of Billboard called the song [...] "overwhelming", while Lindsay Zolandz of Vulture.com deemed it [...] "the most ridiculous song on This Is Acting." [...] Idolator's Kathy Iandoli argued that the song [...] "makes a valiant attempt <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> things <b>up</b> a bit."

50|$|MilSim markers {{are used}} almost {{exclusively}} in Woodsball and military scenario games, though with a few modifications the markers can be competitive in the speedball arena, although {{they tend to be}} at a major disadvantage. High-end MilSim markers are sometimes claimed to be more rugged than high-end speedball markers, but are heavier and tend to operate at slower rates of fire and tend to be made of cheaper materials than markers designed for tournament play. They can feature camouflage or black coloring (rather than the bright colors found on some tournament markers), since stealth is of more value in the woodsball environment. MilSim markers may use hoppers, or magazines similar to real automatic weapons. Many come with a shoulder stock and use a coiled remote line connected to a tank of propellant usually carried on the players back, in order to follow the MilSim look and <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> the marker <b>up</b> and make it more maneuverable.|$|R
