5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level {{of involvement in the}} rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough.|$|E
5|$|The towns {{which were}} located in the {{counties}} could hardly compete with the large Saxon centers. Kolozsvár was granted <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> landed property from the noblemen or other landowners in 1370, but its burghers were regarded as peasants by the bishops of Transylvania and the abbots of Kolozsmonostor Abbey, who forced them to pay the ninth (a seigneurial tax) on their vineyards until 1409. The merchants from Kolozsvár, Dés and other Transylvanian towns were exempted from internal levies, but the noblemen often ignored that privilege, forcing the merchants to pay duties while travelling across their domains.|$|E
5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{provision}} {{is the creation}} of <b>the</b> Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike <b>the</b> Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> established by <b>the</b> Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and extended by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, <b>the</b> Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crofting Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> of <b>the</b> 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and <b>the</b> Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|R

5|$|In 1980, the Housing Act 1980 gave council tenants <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> their homes. In {{light of}} this, {{a group of}} 1500 {{properties}} in the area was given Conservation Area status, and Plumbe's northern section of the estate was granted Article Four Direction by Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, preventing any alterations to the external appearances of the properties without planning permission, in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. St Mark's Church was meanwhile Grade II listed. However, these measures have not been consistently enforced, and Noel Park has been cited in a report by English Heritage as a prominent example {{of the failure of}} conservation areas.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1993, the {{municipal}} council {{voted in favor}} of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> back the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby.|$|E
5|$|As the {{representative}} of Warsaw, he was elected a deputy to the Sejms of 1784 and 1786, {{as well as to}} the Great Sejm (1788–1892). In the meantime, in February 1789, he was elected mayor of Warsaw; he would be reelected in 1790 (as a mayor of Warsaw, he succeeded Wojciech Lobert, and would in turn be succeeded by Józef Michał Łukasiewicz). During the Great Sejm, together with Hugo Kołłątaj, Dekert organized the confederation of 141 cities and towns and was at the forefront of demanding the representations and enfranchisement of the burghers in the Sejm; notably, he helped organize the Black Procession on 2 December 1789 (a march of burghers who delivered a petition to the king). The burghers demanded similar privileges to those held by the nobles (szlachta). Their demands included <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> and own land estates, the right to be represented in the Polish parliament (Sejm) and reforms to the urban law. The procession influenced the Great Sejm to create a Commission for the Cities (Deputacja w sprawie miast) tasked with addressing those concerns during the works on the new constitution.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{responses}} to the consultation the Scottish Government presented the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to the Scottish Parliament on 22 June 2015. The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 16 March 2016, and received Royal Assent on 22 March 2016 becoming Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. The most radical and controversial provision of the act was the creation of <b>the</b> Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> for Sustainable Development. This permitted Scottish Ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Like <b>the</b> Crofting Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> and <b>the</b> Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> abandoned or derelict land, <b>the</b> Community <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area.

5|$|David Murray {{acquired}} {{control of}} Rangers in November 1988. Argyle House, a £4 million extension behind the Govan Stand, was opened in 1990. This added executive boxes, office space and hospitality suites. A further series of developments {{was started in}} the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50,000. Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison {{to find a way}} of adding a third tier to the Main Stand. This was a highly complex process, as the Main Stand facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction. The contractors removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above. The Club Deck, which cost approximately £20 million, was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991. The redevelopment of the Main Stand was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £2 million and a debenture issue that raised £8.5 million. Ordinary fans bought debentures for between £1,000 and £1,650 each, which guaranteed <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> season tickets for at least 30 years, along with some other minor benefits.|$|E

[...] Along with the Record, it also acquired <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> Philadelphias third-oldest radio station, WCAU. In a complex deal, the Bulletin sold off WPEN and WCAUs FM sister, changed WPEN-FMs call letters to WCAU-FM, and the calls for its under-construction television station to WCAU-TV.

Tickets were subject to TWA's normal seat assignment and boarding pass rules and regulations, were not assignable to any other carrier, and were not endorsable.
