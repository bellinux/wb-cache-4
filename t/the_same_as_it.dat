5|$|SH-8 {{was one of}} the {{original}} thirty-one state highways created on 1924-08-24. When it was created, it was a border-to-border highway, stretching from Texas to Kansas. It began at the Red River near Burkburnett, Texas. It then passed through Randlett and had a short concurrency with SH-5 west of Walters. The highway then ran through Lawton—concurring with {{the original}} SH-29—en route to Anadarko via Apache. In Anadarko, SH-8 linked up with the present highway. The remainder of the route was mostly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is today.|$|E
5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> did when it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were gone {{and the only way}} into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act itself did {{not affect}} {{constituencies}} in Scotland or Ireland. However, reforms there were {{carried out by the}} Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of seats in the House of Commons <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised {{and the size of the}} electorate was expanded in both.|$|E

5|$|US-59 {{was first}} {{designated}} in Oklahoma around 1935. The highway's route {{at that time}} was largely <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is today; however, between the Afton area and Welch, US-59 passed through Vinita instead following the modern-day route passing east of it. US-59 was changed to follow the present-day route in 1951. Since then, US-59 has undergone only minor adjustments, many of which eliminated curves and provided a more direct route for travelers using the highway to traverse eastern Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish Empire in the Caribbean {{remained}} intact until the British capture of Havana in 1762.

25|$|After all seat {{disputes}} {{had been}} solved and all 350 seats had been allocated, Prime Minister Felipe González voluntarily submited {{himself to a}} vote of confidence to rectify the atypical investiture vote in which 18 deputies {{had not been able to}} vote. The result was essentially a repeat of the December 1989 voting, with some parties previously voting 'No' choosing to abstain. González's parliamentary support remained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was.|$|E
25|$|If Captain Lynch {{had known}} that the Federal fleet faced a {{shortage}} of ammunition very much like his own, he perhaps would have altered his tactics, although the outcome would likely have been <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>As</b> <b>it</b> was, Rowan ordered the captains in his fleet to conserve their ammunition. They were told to use ramming and boarding, so far as was possible, to disable or capture the enemy ships.|$|E
25|$|All the old barrack {{buildings}} were demolished in 1936 {{to allow the}} construction of the present red brick buildings. One of the more unfortunate aspects of development since the 1930s has been the encroachment of structures outside the Fort Walls, especially on the Hesse and King Street sides. In terms of layout and despite some changes in architectural style, the Fort, as it stands today, is almost <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in 1889.|$|E

25|$|By 1939, SH-22 {{had been}} rerouted through Milburn. This time, the {{southern}} route became SH-299, which took over SH-22 between Nida {{and the state}} line. SH-22 was truncated once again on November 22, 1941, this time {{all the way to}} Ravia, the current western terminus of the route. SH-22 and SH-299 swapped places yet again in 1946, with SH-22 once again taking the southern route. In 1956, SH-22 was extended east to its current terminus at Bokchito. Other than minor realignments, the highway in 1956 was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is today.|$|E
25|$|In {{a fourth}} case, the {{consequences}} of incapacity are more drastic. Although the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 {{made it possible for}} the government or emanations of the state to be sued on contracts {{in the same way as}} a normal individual, where statute confers power on a public body to do certain acts, actions by representatives beyond that power will be ultra vires and void. The result is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was for companies before reform in 1989, so that whole chains of agreements could be declared as non-existent.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{sales tax}} is {{normally}} charged on end users (consumers). The VAT mechanism {{means that the}} end-user tax is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would be with a sales tax. The main disadvantage of VAT is the extra accounting required by those {{in the middle of}} the supply chain; this is balanced by the simplicity of not requiring a set of rules to determine who is and is not considered an end user. When the VAT system has few, if any, exemptions such as with GST in New Zealand, payment of VAT is even simpler.|$|E
