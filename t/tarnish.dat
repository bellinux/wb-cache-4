5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish <b>tarnish</b> when exposed to air.

40|$|This {{research}} {{consists of}} two experimental studies investigating the influence of moral character on endorser perception, {{and the influence of}} perceiver characteristics on <b>tarnished</b> endorser perception and brand evaluations. Perceiver characteristics are discussed from the perspectives of dispositional tendency, innate moral intuitions and self-location. The first study compared the influences of moral character and warmth on endorser perception. The second study examined the impact of perceiver characteristics on <b>tarnished</b> endorsers and brand evaluations. The findings reveal that moral character is more influential than warmth on endorser evaluations. <b>Tarnished</b> endorsers with immoral character exert more negative influence than <b>tarnished</b> endorsers with coldness character on brand evaluations. Innate moral intuitions and self-location moderate brand evaluations. High-morality consumers and heart-locators are more vulnerable than low-morality and brain-locators to the brands endorsed by <b>tarnished</b> endorsers, respectively...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tarnishing</b> of {{synthetic}} chalcopyrite, isocubanite, and pyrrhotite {{in contact with}} jalpaite-acanthite, and of natural chalcopyrite in contact with native silver, was examined. The rate of <b>tarnishing</b> increased with the magnification used, illustrating a dependence on the intensity of incident light on the rate of reaction. Successive analyses using a scanning electron mirocscope on a fixed spot on the sur-face of isocubanite and jalpaite-acanthite grains, respec-tively, showed a gradual increase in silver content. This increase indicates that both exposure to photons and to accelerated electrons results in an increased rate of surface diffusion of silver onto chalcopyrite, isocubanite and pyr-rhotite. The rate of <b>tarnishing</b> is: chalcopyrite or isocubanite » pyrrhotite » pyrite. The rate of <b>tarnishing</b> or the rate of surface diffusion of silver {{is considered to be}} a func-tion of both the surface-bonding properties of the <b>tarnished</b> phases and intensity of incident light...|$|R

5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but <b>tarnish</b> in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of <b>tarnish</b> with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide <b>tarnish</b> showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy [(SEM with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) ] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in conjunction with argon-ion sputtering were the techniques used. The EIS data indicated a capacitive behavior, showing a semicircle that was better defined as the experimental time increased, indicating a decreasing <b>tarnishing</b> resistance of titanium.

40|$|International audienceCyclic voltammetry (CV) and {{electrochemical}} impedance spectroscopy (EIS) {{were used}} to characterize the <b>tarnished</b> thin layer of silver deposited on glass. Instead of natural <b>tarnishing</b> in air environment, an acceleration of <b>tarnishing</b> process was realized by immersion of Ag covered glass in 10 μM K 2 S medium. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that <b>tarnishing</b> product formed on the silver surface consisted of Ag 2 S and Ag 2 O. As electrochemical characterization, the measurements were carried out in aerated 0. 5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution adjusted at pH 10. The impedance spectra collected in sulphate medium at the open-circuit potential show one capacitive loop in parallel with a high resistance, which reflects a blocking electrode behaviour. However, the equivalent electrical circuit, Rs-(CPE//R) is insufficient to reproduce the experimental results correctly. To minimize the dispersion between the experimental and fitted data, the CPE contribution is replaced by two normal power-law distributions of the local resistivity to interpret the <b>tarnishing</b> process in K 2 S medium {{with respect to the}} immersion time. These distributions are associated with the Ag 2 S and Ag 2 O layers...|$|R
