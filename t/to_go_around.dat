5|$|Captain Glušica {{was given}} {{clearance}} to land, however, he suddenly aborted the attempted landing. The aircraft's throttle handle {{was found in}} the forward position, suggesting that the pilot had attempted to abort the landing and take off again. The co-pilot Ahluwalia had warned his commander three times <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> instead of landing; the first of these warnings had come 2.5 miles before the runway threshold.|$|E
5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G. Bekker {{implies that}} the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to wheeled locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> {{the outside of the}} Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|Doctors who {{conducted}} post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims {{had died of}} burns. On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust lever and thrust reverse levers were both in the forward position, possibly indicating that the pilot intended <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around.</b> The inquiry panel stated that information from the FDR would be released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010, {{and that of the}} CVR soon after. The Court of Inquiry would submit its report on 30 September 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the ACWF {{played an important}} role internationally for the CPC. As a communist country in the Cold War, China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections. ACWF was able to reach out to women’s movements abroad, and even hosted 23 delegations {{from other parts of the}} world for the Asia Women’s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled the PRC <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries. However, soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.|$|E

5|$|The B-52 aircraft, callsign Czar 52, {{took off}} at 13:58 and {{completed}} {{most of the}} mission's elements without incident. Upon preparing to execute the touch-and-go on Runway 23 {{at the end of}} the practice profile, the aircraft was instructed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> because a KC-135 aircraft had just landed and was on the runway. Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75m) above ground level (AGL), Holland radioed the control tower and asked for permission to execute a 360° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.|$|E
5|$|Park's plan paid dividends. Bf 110s from ZG 26 {{were soon}} {{discovered}} by No. 56 Squadron and quickly found themselves under attack. In {{the short and}} sharp engagement, ZG 26 lost five Bf 110s and another damaged to No. 56 Squadron. Worse was to follow when No. 54 and 501 engaged the Messerschmitts. ZG 26 lost a further two shot down and two damaged to No. 54 Squadron. None of the RAF Squadrons reported any losses in these engagements. The Geschwader lost other machines to No. 151 and No. 46 Squadrons who arrived to join the battle. According to one source, the total losses of ZG 26 amounted to 12 destroyed and seven damaged throughout the entire day. Another source gives a list of 15 Bf 110s written off; 13 destroyed, two written off and six damaged on 18 August 1940. Whatever the actual losses, The Hardest Day marked {{the start of a}} decline in Bf 110 operations. Production was not keeping pace with losses, and there simply were not enough aircraft <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Brahma Purana gives {{a similar}} account of Ahalya's birth and initial custody, {{recording}} that her marriage was determined {{through an open}} contest. Brahma declares that the first being <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> the three worlds (heaven, earth and the underworld) will win Ahalya. Indra uses his magical powers to complete the challenge, finally reaching Brahma and demanding the hand of Ahalya. However, the divine sage Narada tells Brahma that Gautama went around the three worlds before Indra. Narada explains that Gautama circumambulated the wish-bearing cow Surabhi while she gave birth, {{as part of his}} daily puja (ritual offering), making the cow equal to three worlds according to the Vedas. Brahma agrees and Ahalya marries Gautama, leaving Indra envious and infuriated. A similar, but shorter, version of Ahalya's early life appears in the Padma Purana (701–1200 CE).|$|E

5|$|The Epiriotes {{launched}} their first assault {{against the city}} at daybreak. However, {{they were unable to}} get a firm footing because of the trench and were repulsed by the defenders, who were encouraged by the women. In order to circumvent this obstacle. Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and Chaonians commanded by Ptolemy to attempt <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> the trench. Finding their path blocked by the wagons, they began to pulling them out of the ground. Aware of the danger, Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into the trench after inflicting heavy casualties upon them. Unable to make an impact on the defences, Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> the trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. The wagons were planted so deeply that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to {{remove some of the}} wagons, giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E

Koiwai gives Yotsuba her own camera, which she uses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> taking pictures of people. Yotsuba meets Miura at her apartment building, and they go to Ena's. On the way, a dog grabs her teddy bear and shakes it, making it smell like dog, so they wash it and dry it at the Ayases'. As a result, the bear's ability to speak is broken, so Asagi offers to repair it overnight. Yotsuba spends much of the intervening time sulking about Juralumin's absence until Yanda finally gets a reaction out of her. She goes to the Ayases', where she finds Juralumin repaired.|$|E
