Players then use the stylus to choose where to move and what actions to take; players still have to move the physical pieces on the board, but their moves are also reflected in the app.|$|E
500|$|The Milwaukee Avenue Historic District is a {{historic}} district in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the Seward neighborhood. [...] The district comprises two city blocks of small homes on quarter-sized lots. [...] These houses were built between 1884 and 1890 by William Ragan, a Minneapolis real estate speculator. Built for lower-income residents, the houses had deteriorated in condition {{by the end of}} World War II, and by the 1970s, were planned for demolition. A group of residents and concerned citizens fought to save the houses, eventually leading to their inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and the federal protection and rehabilitation <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> designation. Today, the houses sit along a bike- and pedestrian-friendly mall on which motor traffic is prohibited.|$|E

They {{do not care}} about the cause, but want the free sports watch <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sponsorship. However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin ("Marvin" [...] being {{given to him by}} the apparent pronunciation of the name when he was talking in his native language). Meanwhile, mobs of wild turkeys begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist Dr. Mephisto tries to warn Mayor McDaniels that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans. Mephisto is instead ignored and ridiculed by McDaniels.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{continued}} to invite widely diverse opinions. Among the most unfavourable assessments, author and critic Tim Riley, writing in 1988, dismissed [...] "Within You Without You" [...] as [...] "directionless", adding {{that it was difficult}} to conceive how [...] "lines such as 'Life flows on within you and without you' were taken seriously". He also said that the song was [...] "the most dated piece on the record... could easily have been left off with little to no effect" [...] on the album. In a 2009 review, Alex Young of Consequence of Sound grouped it with the [...] "major clunkers" [...] on Sgt. Pepper. Conversely, Ian Inglis considers the song to be [...] "absolutely central to the form and content" [...] of its parent album, and Ian MacDonald views it as the [...] "conscience" [...] of Sgt. Pepper and [...] "the necessary sermon <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> community singing". Musicologist Russell Reising writes that Harrison's song provides the exception on Sgt. Pepper, where the Beatles otherwise [...] "retreated lyrically into predominantly banal, occasionally schmaltzy, and often trivial vignettes". Author and critic Kenneth Womack terms it [...] "quite arguably, the album's ethical soul".|$|E
500|$|For the PlayStation version, IGN's David Zdyrko cited that [...] "Many of {{the games}} are quite enjoyable, {{but the truth of}} the matter is that it never quite matches the thrill of the real thing" [...] and criticized on how [...] "the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E

500|$|Following the sentence, the Chicago Tribune {{editorial}} board praised [...] "the bravery {{of the victims}} and their families who confronted the man who was once second in line to be president" [...] and wrote of the sentence: [...] "The enduring impact is that the truth has been revealed. And {{for as long as the}} name Dennis Hastert is recalled, the man once respected as a leader will be known as a criminal, a scoundrel, a child molester." [...] The Washington Post {{editorial board}} hailed the sentence, writing that Hastert's victims [...] "should not have had to struggle with what Mr. Hastert did to them all the while they watched him rise in stature and power." [...] The Post called for extending statutes of limitations in sex-abuse cases to give victims more time to come forward and prosecutors more time to pursue perpetrators. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote that Hastert's case underscored the danger <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "quickness and frequency with which so many of us equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude," [...] noting that Hastert's public displays of Christian faith during his time in office were [...] "a factor in his colleagues' assessments of him as safe, uncontroversial." [...] Bruni also critiqued the testimonials that prominent Republicans submitted on Hastert's behalf before sentencing, saying that these [...] "affirm the degree to which pacts rather than principle govern partisan politics today." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 May 2011, {{following}} the 2011 general election, the Prime Minister {{announced that a}} committee would be appointed to review politicians' remuneration, and that revised salaries would take effect from that date. The Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries chaired by Gerard Ee rendered its report on 30 December 2011, and released {{it to the public}} on 4 January 2012. As regards ministerial pay, the Committee recommended benchmarking an MR4-grade minister's salary to the median income of the top 1,000 wage earners who are Singapore citizens, with a 40% discount [...] "to signify the sacrifice <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ethos of political service". It also recommended removing the special allowance and public service leadership allowance; capping performance bonuses at six months' salary (with good performers generally receiving three months' salary); and replacing the GDP bonus with a national bonus based on four equally weighted indicators: the real median income growth rate (that is, the growth rate taking inflation into account), the real growth rate of the incomes of the lowest 20th percentile earners, the unemployment rate, and the real GDP growth rate. As regards the latter, no bonus will be paid if the minimum targets for the indicators are not met. A bonus of three months' salary will be paid if the targets are met, and a maximum bonus of six months' salary if the targets are greatly exceeded. This would result in a reduction of an M4-grade minister's annual salary by 31% of the 2010 figure to $1.1 million.|$|E

2500|$|Aristotle {{uses the}} word [...] "memory" [...] for two basic abilities.

These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past, [...] prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our [...] "imprints" [...] cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.|$|E
