5|$|Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15. His will swept aside <b>the</b> <b>Succession</b> to the Crown Act 1543, {{excluded}} both Mary and Elizabeth from <b>the</b> <b>succession,</b> {{and instead}} declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France. Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by the Privy Council, but her support quickly crumbled, {{and she was}} deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side.|$|E

5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} <b>the</b> <b>succession.</b> At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very reluctant to do this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith {{was said}} to have been ill for some time before his death, dying on 14 December 704 or 705. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle adds that he died at Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. <b>The</b> <b>succession</b> was disputed by Eadwulf, {{supported}} initially by Bishop Wilfrid, and supporters of Aldfrith's young son Osred, apparently led by Berht's kinsman Berhtfrith.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> to the throne {{as well as the}} nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E

5|$|Before Henry's father (Henry VII) {{ascended the}} throne, England had been beset by civil warfare over rival {{claims to the}} English crown. Henry wanted to avoid a similar {{uncertainty}} over <b>the</b> <b>succession.</b> Catherine of Aragon's only surviving child was Princess Mary.|$|E
5|$|Henry I had {{arranged}} his inheritance to pass {{to his daughter}} Empress Matilda. Instead, Stephen, younger brother of Theobald II, Count of Blois, seized the throne.

50|$|By {{the rise}} of Louis XIV, the Habsburgs were chiefly {{dependent}} on their hereditary lands to counter {{the rise of}} Prussia, some of whose territories lay inside the Empire.

5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs was so great that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen {{their position in the}} inevitable battle that would break out over <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's riposte.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Offa had significant influence {{in the early years}} of his reign outside the traditional Mercian heartland.

5|$|Kenilworth was {{restored}} to Dudley's son, Robert, Earl of Leicester, in 1563, {{four years after}} <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> of Elizabeth I to the throne.

5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A protracted {{battle over}} parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage.
