5|$|There are {{fourteen}} extant {{families of}} the order <b>Testudines,</b> an order of reptile commonly known as turtles, tortoises and terrapins. The <b>testudines</b> {{are some of the}} most ancient reptiles alive, with only the tuataras considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 extant species and 97 genera of <b>testudines,</b> split into two suborders: the Cryptodirans and the Pleurodirans. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the side-necked turtles, have long necks, and fold them sideways to align them with the shell. The Pelomedusidae and Chelidae are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The Carettochelyidae, Cheloniidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, Dermochelyidae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Testudinidae and Trionychidae are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae). A third order, the Paracryptodirans, are extinct.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of <b>testudines</b> distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, the skull has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a temporal fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull. This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. <b>Testudines</b> (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than never having had them.|$|E

5|$|The two living non-archosaurian reptile taxa, <b>testudines</b> (turtles) and lepidosaurians (lizards and tuataras), {{along with}} choristoderes (semi-aquatic archosauromorphs that would die {{out in the}} early Miocene), survived across the K–Pg boundary. More than 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K–Pg boundary. Additionally, all six turtle {{families}} in existence {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous survived into the Paleogene and are represented by living species. Living lepidosaurs include the tuataras (the only living rhynchocephalians) and the squamates. The rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous, although they were very successful in the Late Cretaceous of South America. They are represented today by a single genus, located exclusively in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The reptile fauna of New Guinea is {{represented}} by {{three of the four}} extant orders. The squamates, also known as the snakes and lizards, represent the largest group, with approximately 300 described species. The remaining two groups: <b>testudines,</b> or turtles and tortoises, and Crocodilia, the crocodiles, are much less diverse. The turtles are represented by thirteen described species, and the crocodiles two.|$|E
25|$|Modern non-avian {{reptiles}} inhabit {{every continent}} {{with the exception}} of Antarctica. (If birds are classed as reptiles, then all continents are inhabited.) Several living subgroups are recognized: <b>Testudines</b> (turtles and tortoises), approximately 400 species; Rhynchocephalia (tuatara from New Zealand), 1 species; Squamata (lizards, snakes, and worm lizards), over 9,600 species; Crocodilia (crocodiles, gavials, caimans, and alligators), 25 species; and Aves (birds), 10,000 species.|$|E
5000|$|In certain {{families}} {{there is}} a hinge between the [...] and abdominal scutes allowing the turtle to almost completely enclose itself. In certain species the sex of a <b>testudine</b> can be told by whether the plastron is , male or , female. This {{is because of the}} mating position; the male's concave plastron allows it to more easily mount the female during copulation.|$|R
50|$|The genus {{and species}} were first {{described}} in 2007, from the fragmentary remains of a single fossil specimen unearthed in Northeastern Brazil two {{years prior to the}} publication of the description.

50|$|Born in Besançon, Besard studied law (Licentiate and Doctor of Laws, 1587) at the University of Dôle. He {{went on to}} Rome, {{where he}} studied {{medicine}} until c.1595. While in Rome he also studied music with the famous lutenist Lorenzino del Liuto (Lorenzo Tracetti). In 1597 he was in Hesse where he may have taught the lute in addition to practising medicine and law. He then lived for a period in Cologne where in 1603 he published an anthology for lute, Thesaurus harmonicus, containing 403 arrangements for lute in French tablature of contemporaneous instrumental works and songs by various composers (including some by himself). The Thesaurus included an addendum on the method of playing the lute, De modo in <b>testudine</b> libellus, which was later translated into English by Robert Dowland. Moving to Augsburg, probably around 1610, he continued practicing medicine and law, and possibly teaching the lute.|$|R

40|$|In a {{comparison}} of a single mammalian (R. norvegicus) and reptilian species (A. vitticeps) of the same body weight and 2 ̆ 2 preferred 2 ̆ 2 body temperature,the metabolic capacity for energy production was assessed in liver, heart, brain, kidney, lung and skeletal muscle tissues by two methods: measurement of mitochondrial enzyme activity (cytochrome oxidase) and measurement of mitochondrial volume and membrane surface area densities. Both methods showed the mammal to possess an average 2 - 3 fold greater metabolic capacity per gram of tissue. When the larger relative tissue sizes of the mammal were included into the comparison the differences were increased to approximately 5 fold. When the mitochondrial enzyme activities of the six mammalian and reptilian tissues were expressed per gram of tissue protein the differences were reduced. This was because all the reptilian tissues measured had significantly less protein per gram of tissue than the mammalian tissues. Isolated mitochondria from the same six tissues showed the mammalian mitochondria in general to have more protein and less lipid than the reptilian mitochondria and similar oxygen consumptions (measured using cytochrome oxidase) per mg of protein for liver, brain and kidney mitochondria. Isolated mammalian lung, heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria however, consumed twice the amount of oxygen consumed by the same reptilian mitochondria per gram of mitochondrial protein. To assess the use of energy by the same mammalian and reptilian species the 2 ̆ 2 in vitro 2 ̆ 2 oxygen consumption of liver, kidney and brain tissues were measured. 2 ̆ 2 Sodium dependent 2 ̆ 2 metabolism (i. e., {{the amount of energy}} used on pumping Na+ out and K+ into the cells of tissues) was also measured in these tissues. The mammal had 2 ̆ 2 in vitro 2 ̆ 2 tissue metabolisms generally 4 times greater and spent 4 times more energy on Na+ pumping than did the same reptilian tissues. In the liver particularly this difference was 5 fold. To examine the reasons for this difference in 2 ̆ 2 sodium dependent 2 ̆ 2 metabolism between the mammal and reptile, the liver cell membrane Na+ permeabilities of the mammal and reptile plus an amphibian, B. marinus were examined using primary monolayer liver cell culture. The mammalian liver cells were found to be 5 times more permeable to Na+ than either the reptilian or amphibian liver cells. This increased permeability of the endothermic liver cells probably accounts for the large differences in the amounts of energy used by the mammal and ectotherms on Na+ and K+ pumping. This inefficiency in terms of relative energy use of the mammalian cells compared to the ectothermic cells is postulated as having evolved as a means of increasing heat production. The effects of body size and phylogeny on metabolic capacities were examined by comparing the mitochondrial capacities of 6 mammalian and 4 reptilian species representing 100 fold body weight ranges. The mammals examined included 3 eutherian, 2 marsupial and a monotreme and the reptiles 2 saurian, 1 crocodilian and 1 <b>testudine</b> species. The tissues examined were the same six tissues previously mentioned. Allometric equations were derived for tissue weights, mitochondrial volume densities, internal mitochondrial membrane surface area densities, tissue mitochondrial membrane surface areas both per gram and per total tissue and summated tissue mitochondrial membrane surface areas.
