40|$|Excerpt] On October 6, 2010, the 27 member European Union (EU) and South Korea {{signed a}} {{bilateral}} {{free trade agreement}} (<b>FTA).</b> <b>The</b> agreement {{is expected to go}} into effect on July 1, 2011, pending approval by the European Parliament and the South Korean National Assembly. If enacted, <b>the</b> South Korea-EU <b>FTA</b> (KOREU <b>FTA)</b> would be <b>the</b> largest <b>FTA</b> in terms of market size that South Korea has entered into. <b>The</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> reflects <b>the</b> EU and South Korean trade strategies to use FTAs to strengthen economic ties outside their home regions. It also builds upon the surge in trade and investment flows between South Korea and the EU over the past decade. This agreement has possible implications for U. S. trade with South Korea and congressional action on the proposed U. S. -South Korea <b>FTA</b> (KORUS <b>FTA).</b> <b>The</b> proposed KOREU <b>FTA</b> is very comprehensive. It would reduce and eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers in manufactured goods, agricultural products and services and would also cover such trade-related activities as government procurement, intellectual property rights, labor rights and environmental issues. Most studies done on the potential impact of <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> estimate that <b>the</b> agreement will have a small but positive effect on the economies of the EU and South Korea as a whole and that the larger relative impact would be on the South Korean economy. The greatest economic impact of <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> would be on specific sectors in each economy. EU services providers would be expected to experience gains from the agreement, especially in the areas of retail and wholesale trade, transportation services, financial services, and business services. In terms of trade in goods, EU exporters of pharmaceuticals, auto parts, industrial machinery, electronics parts, and some agricultural goods and processed foods would be expected to gain from <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> 2 ̆ 7 s implementation. At the same time, South Korean manufacturers of cars, ships, wireless telecommunications devices, chemical products, and imaging equipment would be expected to increase their exports to the EU market. <b>The</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> is similar to <b>the</b> proposed KORUS <b>FTA</b> in many respects. Both agreements are comprehensive and both would eliminate tariffs on most trade in goods soon after they enter into force. However, they differ in other respects. Phase-out periods for tariffs on some manufactured goods differ. In addition, <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> does not cover foreign direct investment. Unlike <b>the</b> KORUS <b>FTA,</b> <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> would not allow trade sanctions to be applied where violations of the workers 2 ̆ 7 rights, and environment provisions have been deemed to occur. In addition, <b>the</b> KORUS <b>FTA</b> would cover a broader range of trade in services than would <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA.</b> It is not clear whether these differences in the structures of <b>the</b> <b>FTAs</b> would result in appreciable differences in outcomes in terms of economic gains and losses. U. S. and European firms are close competitors in a number of sectors and industries, particularly autos. Some business representatives argue that enactment of <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> before enactment of <b>the</b> KORUS <b>FTA</b> would give European competitors commercial first mover advantages, since EU firms, such as those in the auto industry or the services sector, could gain greater market opportunities in South Korea not afforded to US. firms. On the other hand, other factors could also mitigate such advantages. For example, U. S. multinational firms operating in the EU could benefit from <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the</b> content and fate of <b>the</b> KOREU <b>FTA</b> could influence <b>the</b> pace and tone of any debate in the United States on <b>the</b> KORUS <b>FTA</b> in <b>the</b> 112 th Congress...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{concluded}} {{free trade}} agreements (FTAs) with Korea, Peru, Panama and Colombia in late 2000 s. Since <b>the</b> four <b>FTAs</b> were negotiated and concluded largely contemporaneously, key traits {{and characteristics of}} the agreements are similarly formulated. In light of this, dispute settlement mechanisms (state-to-state dispute settlement proceedings, investor-state dispute settlement proceedings, and Joint Committees) of <b>the</b> four <b>FTAs</b> also share commonalities. At the same time, new ideas and suggestions are explored in <b>the</b> four <b>FTAs.</b> While issues and disputes under <b>the</b> four <b>FTAs</b> have arguably not been ripe for the constitution of dispute settlement proceedings under <b>the</b> <b>FTAs</b> at <b>the</b> moment, sooner or later {{they are likely to}} end up in the dockets of the respective proceedings. The key elements of the four FTAs’ dispute settlement mechanisms are also adopted in other <b>FTAs</b> that <b>the</b> United States have concluded afterwards including most recently the Trans-Pacific Partnership, since these elements are reflective of the general scheme of the United States in their FTAs.

40|$|The Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) {{continues}} to promote an open-trade system via {{the conclusion of}} free trade agreements (FTAs), arguing that Korean enterprises will obtain considerable business opportunities under <b>the</b> <b>FTAs</b> <b>the</b> government has implemented.

We find that the concluded and currently negotiated FTAs of East Asia have produced a fairly limited impact on trade and welfare. The limitation came {{from the fact that}} <b>the</b> selection of <b>FTA</b> partners was not based on economic gains but on an ad hoc basis or a defensive purpose. Therefore, we suggest that East Asian countries concentrate FTA activities on trade partners with large trade volumes. In this regard, the successful conclusion of <b>the</b> ongoing Korea-Japan <b>FTA</b> negotiation is crucial, and the two governments need to dissociate social and historical concerns with economic considerations. <b>The</b> <b>FTAs</b> between China, Korea, Japan and the U. S. should immediately follow <b>the</b> Korea-Japan <b>FTA</b> to realize <b>the</b> potentials and to prevent biased specialization. <b>The</b> <b>FTAs</b> of East Asia allowed a wide range of exemptions to protect inefficient sectors such as agriculture. The proper approach, we suggest, is not to avoid the problem but to proceed with comprehensive agreements and thus maximize <b>the</b> gains of <b>FTAs.</b> Restructuring industries and reallocating resources to the sectors with comparative advantage, while providing adequate assistance programs, is required. We also note that East Asian countries should utilize existing unilateral, regional and multilateral methods of liberalization as well as bilateral FTAs...|$|R

The NTSB also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal Transit Administration for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part of capacity improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision.
