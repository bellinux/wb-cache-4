5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated <b>the</b> <b>starlight</b> of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's other {{compositions}} {{during the}} war included incidental music for a children's play, <b>The</b> <b>Starlight</b> Express (1915); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan (1917); and The Spirit of England (1915–17, to poems by Laurence Binyon), three choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his earlier years. His last large-scale composition of the war years was The Fringes of the Fleet, settings of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres. Elgar conducted a recording of the work for the Gramophone Company.|$|E
5|$|From {{time to time}} special {{seasonal}} {{festivals and}} events are held. They last only for a set {{period of time and}} offer a variety of fun or useful rewards. Many events have changed over time, adding new features and eliminating old ones. These events are geared towards any level, often restricting players to level 1, so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together. Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents, for example: Valentione's Day in place of Valentine's Day, the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza in place of Easter, and <b>the</b> <b>Starlight</b> Celebration in place of Christmas.|$|E

25|$|Infrared astronomical {{interferometer}} (TPF-I): Multiple small telescopes {{on a fixed}} {{structure or}} on separated spacecraft floating in precision formation would simulate a much larger, very powerful telescope.

25|$|Visible Light Coronagraph (TPF-C): A large optical telescope, with {{a mirror}} {{three to four}} times bigger and at least 100 times more precise than the Hubble Space Telescope, would collect starlight and the very dim {{reflected}} light from the planets.
