Hawthorne 1964/1967 {{comments}} about Kettering ignition system: [...] "Practical {{efforts to improve}} or supplant this system have failed, and it has remained virtually unchanged through the years. However, the present trend toward higher performance automobile engines threatens to render this tried and true system obsolete. The principal limitation of the Kettering system is, as typically applied, the inability to develop adequate levels of spark plug gap energy without sacrificing longevity of the ignition points or the <b>transformer</b> <b>coil.</b> The inherent inefficiency {{of the system is}} particularly apparent at higher engine speeds." ...|$|E

50|$|For use in 2-wire repeaters, {{the single}} {{transformer}} version suffices, since amplifiers in the repeaters have grounded inputs and outputs. X, Y, and Z {{share a common}} ground. As shown at left, signal into W, the 2-wire port, will appear at X and Z. But since Y is bridged from center of coil to center of X and Z, no signal appears. Signal into X will appear at W and Y. But signal at Z is the difference of what appears at Y and, through the <b>transformer</b> <b>coil,</b> at W, which is zero. Similar reasoning proves both pairs, W & Y, X & Z, are conjugates.|$|E
50|$|Each {{transformer}} in an {{alternating current}} distribution grid segments the grounding system {{into a new}} separate circuit loop. These separate grids must also be grounded on one side to prevent charge buildup within them relative {{to the rest of}} the system, and which could cause damage from charge potentials discharging across the <b>transformer</b> <b>coils</b> to the other grounded side of the distribution network.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the multiple-layer {{secondary}} of a non-resonant <b>transformer,</b> <b>coils</b> {{for this}} purpose are often single layer solenoids (to minimise skin effect and give improved Q) in parallel with a suitable capacitor, {{or they may be}} other shapes such as wave-wound litz wire. Insulation is either absent, with spacers, or low permittivity, low loss materials such as silk to minimise dielectric losses.|$|R
2500|$|Using {{electric}} motor's inverter {{allows the}} motor windings {{to act as}} the <b>transformer</b> <b>coils,</b> and the existing high-power inverter as the AC-to-DC charger. As these components are already required on the car, and are designed to handle any practical power capability, {{they can be used}} to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with zero additional weight or size. AC Propulsion uses this charging method, referred to as [...] "reductive charging".|$|R
50|$|To power an HMI bulb, special {{ballasts}} {{act as an}} ignitor {{to start}} the arc, and then regulate it by acting as a choke. Two types of ballasts exist: magnetic and electronic (square-wave or flicker-free). Magnetic ballasts are generally much heavier and bulkier than electronic ballasts, as they consist primarily {{of a network of}} large inductors. They are usually cheaper than electronic ballasts. Since the magnetic type of ballast does not maintain the discharge continuously, the lamp actually extinguishes at zero-crossings of the mains waveform; unless the camera is locked to the mains waveform, the difference in frequency between the lamp and the shutter will produce a beat frequency that is visible in the resulting recording. This is why TV standards typically use the power grid frequency as their basic frame rate. Magnetic ballasts are simple devices compared to electronic ballasts. Essentially, a magnetic ballast is a large, heavy <b>transformer</b> <b>coil</b> that uses a simple principle to generate the high startup voltages needed to create an arc in a cold lamp. Input power is routed to a choke coil connected between the main input and the lamp. The coil may be tapped in several places to provide for various input voltages (120 V or 240 V) and a high start-up voltage. Capacitors are also included to compensate for the inductance of the coil and improve the power factor. Because of the high amount of current through the ballast, a low humming sound is often heard due to magnetostriction of the ballast iron laminations. Some magnetic ballasts have insulation around the coil for silent operation.|$|E

25|$|Generally every AC {{power line}} {{transformer}} {{acts as an}} isolation transformer, and every step up or down {{has the potential to}} form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from blowing fuses when shorted to their ground conductor. The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, {{on both sides of the}} input and output <b>transformer</b> <b>coils.</b> Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.|$|R

We have also simulated an ADSL modem and run the simulation for the two different media. The comparison includes data rate, BER and transmitting power and proves that power lines need much more energy per transmitting bit under similar circumstances in order to transmit more than 1 Mbps.

Several coil strips are mounted on great circles around the spherical shell of the gyrostabilized platform. Electronics outside the platform uses similar strip-shaped transformers to read the varying magnetic fields produced by the transformers wrapped around the spherical platform. Whenever a magnetic field changes shape, or moves, it will cut the wires of the coils on the external transformer strips. The cutting generates an electric current in the external strip-shaped coils, and electronics can measure that current to derive angles.|$|R
5000|$|A {{transformer}} is {{a static}} device that converts alternating current from one voltage level {{to another level}} (higher or lower), or to the same level, without changing the frequency. A transformer transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductors—the <b>transformer's</b> <b>coils.</b> A varying electric current in the first or primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core and thus a varying magnetic field through the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field induces a varying electromotive force (EMF) or [...] "voltage" [...] in the secondary winding. This effect is called mutual induction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a methodology for integrated power flow modeling {{of the impact}} of geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) on the power system voltage stability. GMDs cause quasi-dc, geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in the transformers and transmission lines, which in turn cause saturation of the high voltage transformers, greatly increasing their reactive power consumption. GICs can be calculated using standard power flow modeling parameters such as line resistance, augmented with several GIC specific fields including substation geographic coordinates and grounding resistance, transformer configuration, and <b>transformer</b> <b>coil</b> winding resistances. When exact values are not available estimated quantities can be used. By then integrating GIC into power flow analysis, the changes in reactive power losses and bus voltages can be quantified to assess the risk of voltage instability and large-scale voltage collapse.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} as a tutorial on electromagnetic modeling to measure and estimate the complex valued relative permeability of magnetic steel. The main application is with the estimation of the electromagnetic material parameters of the armour wires used with high-voltage AC power cables. When the magnetic field intensity is sufficiently far from saturating the magnetic steel, the magnetic hysteresis phenomena can {{be approximated by using}} a linearization approach based on a complex valued (and frequency and amplitude dependent) relative permeability. In the report it is demonstrated how the complex valued permeability of magnetic steel can be efficiently estimated {{in the presence of a}} strong skin-effect. This is achieved by using a simple <b>transformer</b> <b>coil</b> built on the magnetic steel to be tested and by efficient numerical modeling based on waveguide theory and complex analysis.

The AVS is an in-can melting system in which high-level waste (HLW) is vitrified directly inside the final disposal container. The AVS container, or module, consists of an outer stainless steel canister and an alumina-lined, inner graphite crucible, which is thermally insulated from the outer stainless canister. The graphite crucible is inductively heated to very high temperatures (up to 1500 C) by an external low frequency (30 Hertz) alternating current (AC) <b>transformer</b> <b>coil.</b> The actively cooled outer stainless canister remains at near ambient temperature. The HLW/frit mixture is fed into the hot graphite crucible, where it is vitrified.

All radioactively contaminated melter components inside the module are disposed of along with the vitrified waste. The graphite crucible also provides a geologically stable barrier for the vitrified product. The AVS potentially can double HLW loading over that obtained from Joule melters; lower vitrification costs by about half; reduce the number of disposal canisters required by about half; handle diverse waste feeds with high concentrations of problem elements such as chromium and zirconium; and reduce the time needed to vitrify a given inventory of HLW...|$|E

The purpose of this design is to make a simple PD signal simulation and to save the time of experiment. The design must take into account the electric field stress at the electrodes (anode) that will cause PD. The electrodes were designed as 2 types. The first is a conventional electrode expected to make a high nonuniform field. The second electrode was designed as insulation layer and <b>transformer</b> <b>coil</b> to generate higher nonuniform field and expected to cause PD easily. Electrodes were simulated to determine the maximum of electric field by installing in the transformer model. Then, the electrodes are installed in the transformer model to make the real test by supplying high voltage to the electrodes to generate PD signal. From the measurement results of PD-location in the power transformer model according to AE and TDOA method found that, the first electrode has uncertain PD-location measurement results. Moreover, it take so long time of any experiment to obtain PD-signal and sometimes become critical breakdown as a result to damage measurement device. While the PD-location detection results from the second electrode found that it can be easily simulated PD signal.

The maximum avail-able gain is {{used to evaluate the}} quality of transformers similarly to that of active devices. The silicon substrate has a pronounced effect on the quality factor and mutual resistive coupling factor of the primary and secondary coils, thereby degrading the maximum available gain of the transformer. A highly structured patterned ground shield is shown to improve the maximum available gain of a transformer at high frequencies, while at low frequencies, it has little effect on the maximum available gain and even degrades the quality factors of the <b>transformer</b> <b>coils.</b> It is shown that the low-fre-quency degradation of the coil quality factors relates to local eddy currents in the patterned metal shield.

This varying magnetic field induces a varying electromotive force (EMF), or "voltage", in the secondary winding. This effect is called inductive coupling. If a load {{is connected to the}} secondary, current will flow in the secondary winding, and electrical energy will be transferred from the primary circuit through the transformer to the load. In an ideal transformer, the induced voltage in the secondary winding (Vs) is in proportion to the primary voltage (Vp) and is given by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary (Ns) to the number of turns in the primary (Np) as follows...|$|R
