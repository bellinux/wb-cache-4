The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume to the beat of the drum of a young boy. Ikata's performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{school the}} {{following}} day, {{the town is}} stunned by Colin's death. Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is hungry and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him {{in order to protect}} him. Chip still goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance,</b> hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed with a pool skimmer by a fatally injured Chip. Jennifer escapes while Needy watches her boyfriend die.|$|E

Originally a Northern Indian temple dance, it was {{transformed}} to a court dance in the Mughal era.

25|$|Lindy hop's {{nature as}} a {{predominantly}} social dance with its roots as a self-learned vernacular dance, combined with the comparative lack of experts, resources, and public demand in many local communities also contribute to its differences.

25|$|In 1841, Berlioz wrote recitatives for a {{production}} of Weber's Der Freischütz at the Paris Opéra and also orchestrated Weber's Invitation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dance</b> to add ballet music to it (he titled the ballet L'Invitation à la valse, and the original piano piece has often been mistitled as a result). Later that year Berlioz finished composing the song cycle Les nuits d'été for piano and voices (later to be orchestrated). He also entered into an intimate relationship with singer Marie Recio who would become his second wife.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} of the drummers {{in these}} groups was of particular {{significance in the}} development of early drum sets. Cymbals, bass, and snare drums were all used. Indeed, a method of damping a set of cymbals by crunching them together while playing bass drum simultaneously is probably how today's hi-hat, a major part of today's drum set, came about. Military technique and instrumentation were undoubtedly factors {{in the development of}} early jazz and its drumming, but the melodic and metric elements in jazz are more easily traced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance</b> bands of the time period.|$|E

25|$|At {{the peak}} of his {{creative}} powers, Kelly made what in retrospect some see as a mistake. In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM that sent him to Europe for nineteen months to use MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions. Only one of these pictures was a musical, Invitation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dance,</b> a pet project of Kelly's to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences. It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956.|$|E
25|$|During {{his years}} as a {{travelling}} virtuoso, Liszt performed an enormous amount of music throughout Europe, but his core repertoire always centered around his own compositions, paraphrases and transcriptions.

Among the works by other composers were Weber's Invitation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dance,</b> Chopin mazurkas, études by composers like Ignaz Moscheles, Chopin and Ferdinand Hiller, but also major works by Beethoven, Schumann, Weber and Hummel, {{and from time to time}} even selections from Bach, Handel and Scarlatti.|$|E

He asked her to help him find Nico. The two later found Nico at the pumpkin patch, where the owner warned Emma to stay away. Unbeknownst to Emma, Henry used the missing horse search to allow Regina, Hook, Robin, and Belle sneak into Emma's home to find out what she kept in the basement.

25|$|In fall 2003, {{the members}} went their {{separate}} ways due to lasting exhaustion, focusing on their individual solo careers in music, theatre, television and film. In 2007, {{it was confirmed that}} four members of the original line-up had re-formed permanently and were set to record their first studio album in over four years, Destiny (2007). A year after, the group represented Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, where they finished 23rd in the final voting. After another musical hiatus, the band released a second post-reunion studio album titled Welcome <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dance</b> in 2009 which failed commercially. In September 2010, Benaissa officially left the band due to private reasons, leaving No Angels as a trio. Contrary to previous statements, further projects failed to materialize and the group has split again since.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Boyce, now Intelligence Officer, and Charlie Murphy began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} raid a British military barracks in Northern Ireland for weapons and other supplies. They enlisted a fellow Dubliner and IRA man to infiltrate the barracks by joining the British Army. The man was posted to Armagh, and while there, kept in contact with Murphy and Boyce at soldiers' dances. The two men would leave the hall, appearing to court the various girls they brought with them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dance,</b> but in actuality were meeting their informant and scouting the area outside the installation gathering substantial information on movement of troops and weapons storage. This information was backed up with detailed mapsand photographs taken with a Minix spy camera. The eventually felt confident enough to plan the raid for 12 June 1954.|$|E

Jen {{continues}} to manipulate both Naomi and Ryan by manipulating Naomi into lending her a large amount of money, and by persuading Ryan that Liam is hitting on her. Silver, being paired up with Teddy, learns that Teddy's mother died, which causes a friendship to blossom. Liam meets Ivy, a surfer whom he butts heads with. They form a friendship, which is later made complicated by Ivy having feelings for Liam, feelings which Liam rebuffs. Navid and Gia launch an investigation, believing that Jasper is a drug dealer.
