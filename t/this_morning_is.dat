2500|$|On 18 December, {{the head}} of the United Nations Environmental Program told the BBC that [...] "the summit as of <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> a summit in crisis" [...] and that only the arrival of heads of state could bring the summit to a {{successful}} conclusion. Head of climate change for WWF in Britain, said that the proposals made so far, especially those from industrialised countries [...] "all far short of what the world needs".|$|E
2500|$|Sister Sharon Holland said [...] "We {{learned that}} what we hold in common {{is much greater than}} any of our differences." [...] MÃ¼ller said that the Vatican is certain that the LCWR is [...] "fostering a vision of {{religious}} life that is centered on the Person of Jesus Christ and is rooted in the Tradition of the Church." [...] Phil Lawler of catholicculture.org said that while Catholics should be able to take these things for granted, a Vatican intervention had been necessary in this case. He said that their statements do not guarantee that the Vatican intervention will prove successful, but that they do demonstrate that the process was necessary. When the conclusion was announced in April 2015, Christopher Bellitto, a church historian at Kean University, noted, [...] "Anything coming out of the Vatican <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> nothing other than a fig leaf because they can't say 'oops' in Latin." ...|$|E
2500|$|American author Ralph Ellison wrote {{a tribute}} to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel Invisible Man. According to Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad, the {{character}} of the narrator [...] "resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick". Ellison acknowledges his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana, and evocates a church service: [...] "Brothers and sisters, my text <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black...'" [...] In this scene Ellison [...] "reprises a moment in the second chapter of Moby-Dick", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford {{looking for a place to}} spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: [...] "It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there." [...] According to Rampersad, it was Melville who [...] "empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition" [...] by his example of [...] "representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text".|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he said. [...] "I {{presume that}} your visit <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> one of courtesy. You are acquainted with Mr. Fielding?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uh--Will, I {{wonder if}} that {{young man in the}} white flannel trousers, at church <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> Valborg person that they're all talking about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come thro', come thro', Lieutenant Gordon! [...] Come thro' {{and drink}} some wine wi' me! [...] Yestreen I was your prisoner, [...] But now <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>am</b> I free." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian {{declaration}} of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: [...] "War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna." [...] Asquith {{wrote in a letter}} to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that:"Russia is trying to drag us in. The news <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> that Serbia had capitulated on the main points, but it is very doubtful if any reservations will be accepted by Austria, who is resolved upon a complete and final humiliation. The curious thing is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very bad case. But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make most people think that is a case of a big Power wantonly bullying a little one. Anyhow, it is the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years." [...] In order to stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia.|$|E
60|$|Your {{despatch}} of <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> just received, and I fear I do not perfectly understand it.|$|E
60|$|The note {{you sent}} me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> {{a very nice}} one, and the {{spelling}} is beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Inform Prince Sovan," [...] he directed, [...] "that {{it is our}} {{wish that}} the fleet which {{departed}} for Kaol <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>be</b> recalled to cruise {{to the west of}} Ptarth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you really}} believe that the {{mutilated}} remains which you discovered <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>are</b> the remains of our brother?' he asked. 'And do you believe it on such evidence as this?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There weren't any,' said Tegumai. 'My only visitor <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> {{the poor}} fellow {{that you are}} trying to choke. Aren't you well, or are you ill, O Tribe of Tegumai?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, she's not married, but {{the young}} preacher you heard <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> after her, they say, and he's a mighty nice chap." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{which she}} replied, [...] "You must not {{take all the}} credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> {{due in part to}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alone!' he said, 'and John here <b>this</b> <b>morning!</b> <b>Is</b> there {{anything}} the matter, my dear? But no,' he added, 'your face tells quite another story.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{not what}} has passed <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>be</b> thought a {{sufficient}} reason," [...] added Rose, drawing nearer to the mate, and dropping her voice {{so as not}} to be heard by her aunt.|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> perfect, {{and after}} breakfast Aunt said, condescendingly: [...] "I {{think you may}} attend church if you wish, Marguerite. Remember that I expect you to conduct {{yourself}} with becoming prudence and modesty." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{answered}} {{her with a}} certain amount of gravity. [...] "Who can tell? The papers <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>were</b> bad. <b>This</b> conference at The Hague is still unexplained. France's attitude in the matter is especially mysterious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (1) [...] "The {{total sum}} asked {{for in the}} army estimates, {{published}} <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>is</b> 14,752,200l., being an increase of 412,000l. over the previous year." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went for}} him without more ado. [...] "I {{understand}} {{there was an}} official communication to the Home from the Harbour Office <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>Is</b> that so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to Almayer's house? They say in the {{settlement}} that Dain the trader, he that was found drowned <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>is</b> lying in the white man's campong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, hush!" [...] said Field, {{and then}} in a louder voice he said, [...] "It may be so, but as our {{messengers}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>were</b> not permitted to enter and were treated with great indignity--" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Blake's {{report of}} himself, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>was</b> {{the same as}} before. We {{determined}} not to disturb Betteredge by overlooking him at the house to-day. To-morrow will be time enough for our first visit of inspection.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me now, my dear host," [...] the Prince began, {{with some}} eagerness in his tone, [...] "continue and, I trust, {{conclude}} {{the conversation to}} which all that I said <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> merely the prelude." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} {{been looking at the}} view from my window--and I notice one thing which has struck me. The mist <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> the {{thickest}} mist I have yet seen here.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{had a lot}} {{of trouble}} with him, sir," [...] she said significantly. [...] "He was terrible all last night, and he's very weak <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>Is</b> this the young lady, sir?" ...|$|E

50|$|An offer had <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>been</b> made {{to pay the}} draught of 5l. This offer had {{not been}} {{accepted}} by the clerk of Mr. Matthewson, as he did not consider he had authority to accept the money.|$|R
6000|$|... "So do mine," [...] Matteo agreed. [...] "In addition, I am hungry, for {{the bread}} {{they gave us}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> not fit for dogs, {{although}} I had to eat it, as it was that or nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, pardon me," [...] I returned; [...] "what I {{expressed}} <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was,</b> if I remember rightly, {{not at all}} a 'doubt,' but a positive, intimate {{conviction that}} was inconsistent with any doubt. I was emphatic--purely and simply--that I didn't see it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{yet it is}} {{very easy}} now to get to Jerusalem,' said Tancred; 'the great difficulty, as a very {{remarkable}} man said to me <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>is</b> {{to know what to do}} when you are there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{who is that}} guy?" [...] {{he asked}} complainingly. [...] "The big son of a gun leaning on the rail. Seems like he'd got a {{hangover}} <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>Is</b> he deaf and dumb or just plain grouchy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the money}} {{which has been}} taken <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> in the drawer, and unless there is {{something}} more {{you want to say}} to me I will go, as I made an engagement down town for ten o'clock." ...|$|E
60|$|MARCHBANKS. As old as {{the world}} now. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> I <b>was</b> eighteen.|$|R
60|$|I {{was very}} glad to get your letter before leaving Glasgow <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a poor return for it, but the post goes out early, and we come in late.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Colonel, who {{possibly}} {{expected to}} meet you here? Why! did you dine in the saloon? I only arrived <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> my friend, Mr. Grey; Colonel von Trumpetson." ...|$|R
