50|$|Strike slip dulexes are passive structures; {{they form}} as a {{response}} to displacement of the bounding fault rather than by the stresses from plate motion. Each horse has a length that varies from half to twice the spacing between the bounding fault planes. Depending on the properties of the rocks and the fault, the duplexes will have different length ratios and will develop on either major or subtle offsets, although it is possible to observe duplex structures that develop on nearly straight fault segments.Because the motion of the duplexes may be heterogeneous, the individual horses can experience a rotation with a horizontal axis, which results in the formation of scissor faults. Scissor faults exhibit normal motion {{at one end of the}} horse and a <b>thrust</b> <b>motion</b> ant the other end. Because strike slip duplexes structures have more horizontal motion than vertical motion, they are best observed on a map rather than a vertical projection, and are a good indication that the main fault has a strike slip motion.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} {{sectors of}} the Orobic Alps (Northern Italy) are characterised by Alpine age regional shortening showing a transition, through time, from plastic to brittle deformation. Thrust faults cut Alpine ductile folds and are marked by cataclasites and, locally, by pseudotachylytes, suggesting that motion was accommodated by seismic frictional slip. In the Eastern Orobic Alps the thrusting initiated at depths deeper than 10 km (the emplacement depth of the Adamello pluton) and possibly continued at shallower depths. This demonstrates that <b>thrust</b> <b>motion</b> occurred between 10 km depth and the brittle-ductile transition, i. e., at mid-crustal depths. The Orobic Alps exhumed paleoseismic zone shows different geometries along strike. In the central {{sectors of the}} Orobic Alps, thrust faults, associated with pseudotachylytes, have average dips around 40 degrees and show no pervasive veining. Much steeper thrusts (dips up to about 85 degrees) occur in the eastern Orobic Alps. In this area, faults are not associated with pervasive veining, i. e., fluid circulation was relatively scarce. This suggests that faulting did not occur with supralithostatic fluid pressure conditions. These reverse faults are severely misoriented (far too steep) for fault reactivation in a sublithostatic fluid pressure regime, We suggest that <b>thrust</b> <b>motion</b> likely started when the fault, were less steep and that the faults were progressively rotated {{up to the present}} day dips. Domino tilting is probably responsible for this subsequent fault steepening, as suggested by a decrease of the steepness of thrust faults from north to south and by systematic rotations of previous structures consistently with tilting of thrust blocks. When the faults became inclined beyond the fault lock-up angle, no further thrusting was accommodated along them. At later stages regional shortening was accommodated by newly formed lower angle shear planes (dipping around 30 - 40 degrees), consistently with predictions from fault mechanics.

Movement on these buried faults is difficult to observe, but synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry has imaged slip on at least 600 km 2 of the Shahdad basal-thrust and splay-fault network in southeast Iran. Approximately 70 mm of <b>thrust</b> <b>motion</b> on the 8 °-dipping Shahdad basal thrust occurred 8 - 30 km {{to the east of}} the 14 March 1998 Fandoqa earthquake (Mw = 6. 6) that involved 1. 6 m of oblique (strike slip and normal slip) displacement on a steeply dipping fault. That earthquake transferred stress to the Shahdad basal thrust and associated splays, triggering slip either immediately or in the following six months. Modeling shows that, to produce the observed surface deformation, the Shahdad faults must have accommodated a nearly complete release of the shear stress increase. This could be due to either low friction on the faults or deformation throughout a wedge of material that is everywhere close to failure.
