On October 3, 2011 three companies—two contractors and Kinder Morgan—each entered guilty pleas to a 21-count indictment in Provincial Court. The Crown sought a sentence of a $1,000 fine and a $149,000 contribution to the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation, which works to protect B.C.'s fish, wildlife and habitats. Kinder Morgan was also asked to contribute $100,000 to an educational and training program.|$|R
5000|$|An {{excavation}} {{undertaken by}} Headland Archaeology [...] encountered the foundation <b>trench</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> defensive wooden palisade enclosing postholes of a substantial timber building. Access to the compound was through an elaborate entrance, possibly with two gateways, shown below.. Historical research and post-excavation work {{has led to}} this being interpreted as a 12th-century stockaded farmstead without obvious excavated parallels. At that time {{it is likely that}} the Perceton lands were run by a steward, resident in the farmstead in the name of an absentee landowner. This type of site may be common but rarely visible, except as a cropmark, which without excavation may be mistakenly classified as prehistoric.|$|R

50|$|Pre-cast trench drains {{generally}} come in 4-inch widths but {{can range}} {{anywhere from a}} 1-3/4-inch slot to 2-inch-wide channels with grates, and up to any size imaginable through custom trench drain divisions. A home owner could consider <b>a</b> pre-cast <b>trench</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> landscaping project as there are many pre-cast trench drain systems being manufactured specifically for the residential market. A person generally {{can go to a}} pre-caster or a distributor and buy 50 feet of trench drain out of the yard; the cost of the material to create the trench drains can be more expensive than simply using cast-in-place systems, however the money saved through installation, maintenance, and longevity heavily outweighs those costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{results of}} the {{excavation}} were impressive. The earliest identifiable occupation on the hill was Early and Late Neolithic. After an apparent hiatus during the earlier Bronze Age it was reoccupied in the centuries around 1000BC, remaining so continuously until {{at least the first}} century AD. His excavations produced scant evidence for Roman occupation, aside from a barracks block of the latter first century but demonstrated that it was the largest reoccupied fortified hilltop in post-Roman Britain. He also identified Late Saxon refurbishment of the defences and <b>a</b> foundation <b>trench</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> probable cruciform church, apparently never completed but intended {{to meet the needs of}} moneyers moved to the hill for security during the early 11th century AD.|$|R

5000|$|In 1938 Lussu's novel Un anno sull'altipiano ("A Year on the Plateau"), was {{published}} in Paris. This thinly fictional account tells {{of the lives of}} soldiers during World War I and the trench warfare they encountered. Un anno sull'altipiano underlines, with chill rationalism, how the irrationalities of warfare affected the common man. Gifted with a keen sense of observation and sharp logic, Lussu demonstrates how distant the real life of soldiers is from everyday activities. In a notable passage, he describes the silent terror in the moments preceding an attack, as he is forced to abandon the [...] "safe" [...] protective <b>trench</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> external unknown, risky, undefined world: “All the machine-guns are waiting for us”.|$|R
