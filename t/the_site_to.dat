5|$|Flat Bastion Magazine {{had been}} {{abandoned}} for years when geology enthusiast Freddie Gomez undertook its restoration. Gomez, whose interests include both history and geology, converted the magazine to a geological research facility and exhibition centre.

The men of the 150 (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment also spent a day performing repairs at the magazine. Gomez aspires to open <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>to</b> the public.|$|E
50|$|The project {{made little}} {{progress}} until 1965 when Ashland Oil founder Paul G.

Renderings of the proposal, called Cloud Hill, show the guitar scoreboard and a portion of the outfield wall left intact. This plan awaits final approval by Metro Parks and the Metro Council.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of news {{trucks and}} members of the press arrived at <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>to</b> cover the story. The press {{immediately}} noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident. Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Indiana {{transferred}} <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>to</b> the National Park Service. Adjacent to {{the memorial}} is a visitor center which presents interpretive programs and displays.

40|$|The {{locations}} of diy-ged-bay (DGB) <b>sites</b> in <b>the</b> Mandara Mountains, northern Cameroon are hypothesized to {{occur as a}} function of their ability to see and be seen from points on the surrounding landscape. A series of geostatistical, two-way and Bayesian logistic regression analyses were performed to test two hypotheses related to the intervisibility of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>to</b> one another and their visual prominence on the landscape. We determine that the intervisibility of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>to</b> one another is highly statistically significant when compared to 10 stratified-random permutations of DGB sites. Bayesian logistic regression additionally demonstrates that the visibility of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>to</b> points on <b>the</b> surrounding landscape is statistically significant. <b>The</b> location of <b>sites</b> appears <b>to</b> have also been {{selected on the basis of}} lower slope than random permutations of sites. Using statistical measures, many of which are not commonly employed in archaeological research, to evaluate aspects of visibility on the landscape, we conclude that the placement of DGB sites improved their conspicuousness for enhanced ritual, social cooperation and/or competition purposes...|$|R
5|$|In 2003 NOAA divers {{and volunteers}} {{returned}} to the Monitor {{with the goal of}} obtaining overall video of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>to</b> create a permanent record of the current conditions on the wreck after the turret recovery.

In addition, two Chicago firms purchased the tax lien certificates on the property.|$|E
5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, {{the shrine}} {{has become a}} controversial symbol for Japanese nationalists. While many citizens of various political persuasions visit <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>to</b> honor relatives killed in battle, whose kami (spirit) {{are said to be}} enshrined there, so too are the kami of several class-A war criminals. These criminals were enshrined in a secret ceremony in 1978, which has raised the ire of Japanese pacifists and the international community.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the {{railways}} the railway land in the centre of the town stood empty for many years. Most prominent was a green space between the museum and brook which housed a dis-used pit wheel on a low steel frame, which many passers-by mistook for a spinning wheel.
