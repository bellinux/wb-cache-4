It can occur either because of failure to deliver sufficient anesthetic medication to the patient's body, or because of individual patient factors <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> patient is resistant to what would normally be an adequate dose of anesthetic medication.|$|E

500|$|Under {{new manager}} Charlie Manuel, whose {{offensive}} strategy predominantly revolved around hitting lots of home runs, Rollins struggled {{to post a}} strong batting average early in the Phillies' 2005 season, as he too tried to hit home runs. Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team. His offensive strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season's final 36 games; during the streak, he hit [...]379. It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies' history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, whose streak lasted 31 games. Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth: [...] "If we lose and I keep the streak, what does <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>The</b> season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That's what we all want." [...] Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game. Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, tying Johnny Damon for most among active players, and posted a [...]290 batting average with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of {{interest}} rates, a very common but ambiguous way to say that an interest rate rose from 10% per annum to 15% per annum, for example, {{is to say that}} the interest rate increased by 5%, which could theoretically mean that it increased from 10% per annum to 10.05% per annum. It is clearer to say that the interest rate increased by 5 percentage points (pp). The same confusion between the different concepts of percent(age) and percentage points can potentially cause a major misunderstanding when journalists report about election results, for example, expressing both new results and differences with earlier results as percentages. For example, if a party obtains 41% of the vote and this {{is said to be a}} 2.5% increase, does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> earlier result was 40% (since 41 = [...] ) or 38.5% (since 41 = [...] )? ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} 5th Marquess {{inherited}} the family seat, which he renamed Anglesey Castle. Renowned for his lavish spending and flamboyant lifestyle, he converted the family chapel inside the house into a performance space called the Gaiety Theatre. Plays were put on regularly, with [...] "the Dancing Marquess" [...] often taking the lead role himself. The 5th Marquess's extravagant spending drained the family fortune, and after his death in 1905, 6th Marquess began to sell off assets to help restore the solvency of the family. The family also sold off their main home at Beaudesert and their London house, and moved into Plas Newydd permanently. The 6th Marquess made the final big changes to the house by removing the crenellations from the roof, disposing of the theatre, knocking three servants' rooms together to make the dining room and covering over a courtyard to provide a roof for the servants. In the 1930s the artist Rex Whistler was a regular visitor to Plas Newydd. He painted numerous portraits of Lady Caroline Paget, and in 1936-38 painted the largest canvas painting in the UK. It is a trompe-l'oeil seascape painting that fills a whole wall of the dining room with an imagined scene of Italianate churches, castles, Snowdonian mountains and a complete harbour wall, with tricks of perspective <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> scenes appear to change when seen from different parts of the room.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Ashurst, {{encouraged}} by so much assent, {{went on to}} unfold his System of Interpretation, which was of a strictly commercial or company-promoting character. It ran like a prospectus. 'We have inherited the gold of Australia and the diamonds of the Cape,' he said, growing didactic, and lifting one fat forefinger; 'we are now inheriting Klondike and the Rand, for it is morally certain that we shall annex the Transvaal. Again, [...] "the chief things of the ancient mountains, and the precious things of the everlasting hills." [...] What does <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>The</b> ancient mountains are clearly the Rockies; can the everlasting hills be anything but the Himalayas? [...] "For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas"--that refers, of course, to our world-wide commerce, due mainly to imports--"and of the treasures hid in the sand." [...] Which sand? Undoubtedly, I say, the desert of Mount Sinai. What then is our obvious destiny? A lady of your intelligence must gather at once that it is----?' He paused and gazed at me.|$|E

What the world calls civilization, as distinguished from religion, is a retrograde movement, and will ultimately lead {{us back to}} the barbarism from which we have escaped. For instance, you talk of progress: what is the chief social movement of all the countries that three centuries ago separated from the unity of the Church of Christ? The rejection of the sacrament of Christian matrimony. The introduction of the law of divorce, which is, in fact, only a middle term to the abolition of marriage. What does <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>The</b> extinction of the home and the household on which God has rested civilization. If there be no home, the child belongs to the state, not to the parent. The state educates the child, and without religion, because the state in a country of progress acknowledges no religion. For every man is not only to think as he likes, but to write and to speak as he likes, and to sow with both hands broadcast, where he will, errors, heresies, and blasphemies, without any authority on earth to restrain the scattering of this seed of universal desolation. And this system, which would substitute for domestic sentiment and Divine belief the unlimited and licentious action of human intellect and human will, is called progress. What is it but a revolt against God?" ...|$|E

What does <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>The</b> separation between Church and State, talked of {{for a long}} time, now demonstrated. And what does separation between Church and State mean? That society is no longer consecrated. The civil governments of the world no longer profess to be Catholic. The faithful indeed among their subjects will be represented at the council by their pastors, but the civil powers have separated themselves from the Church; either by royal edict, or legislative enactment, or revolutionary changes, they have abolished {{the legal status of}} the Catholic Church within their territory. It is not their choice; they are urged on by an invisible power that is anti-Christian, and which is the true, natural, and implacable enemy of the one visible and universal Church. The coming anarchy is called progress, because it advances along the line of departure from the old Christian order of the world. Christendom was the offspring of the Christian family, and the foundation of the Christian family is the sacrament of matrimony, the sprit of all domestic and public morals. The anti-Christian societies are opposed to the principle of home. When they have destroyed the hearth, the morality of society will perish. A settlement in the foundations may be slow in sinking, but it brings all down at last. The next step in de-Christianizing the political life of nations is to establish national education without Christianity. This is systematically aimed at wherever the revolution has its way. The period and policy of Julian are returning. Some think this bodes ill for the Church; no, it is the State that will suffer. The secret societies are hurrying the civil governments of the world, and mostly the governments who disbelieve in their existence, to the brink of a precipice, over which monarchies, and law, and civil order, will ultimately fall and perish together." ...|$|E
