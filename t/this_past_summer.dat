He will concentrate on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>summer.</b> During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E

Darryl Sterdan from Jam! commented that [...] "even though the gig isn't exactly mind-blowing— the Matrix-style wire-work probably looked way cooler in person {{than it does}} on TV... the set has enough hits {{to make it a}} decent historical document". According to Orlando Sentinels Ben Wener, Drowned World Tour 2001 was [...] "the same eye-popping show aired <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>summer</b> on HBO, only with vastly superior sound and sparkling picture". A reviewer from DVD.net gave the video a rating of six on ten, and the audio a nine on ten. The reviewer praised the DVD saying that [...] "this is a quality release that highlights a performer well and truly on top of her game and for what it's worth, she is probably among the best at what she does." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unable to come {{to terms}} with the Rangers, Shanahan sat out the first half of the 2008–09 season. Then, on January 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Shanahan agreed to join the New Jersey Devils for his second stint with the team. Four days later, on January 14, the terms of the contract were finalized and Shanahan signed a one-year, $800,000 prorated contract. The time between Shanahan's departure from and return to the Devils was 17 years, 294 days, the longest gap in tenure with one team in NHL history. Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan's sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, [...] "When I signed <b>this</b> <b>past</b> <b>summer,</b> Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire and I agreed that if we were unable to find a suitable fit in which I would be able to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside." [...] Shanahan had played just four pre-season games of the 2009–10 season. He scored the Devils' last pre-season goal that year, on one of his last NHL shifts.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Leptospirosis is a {{zoonotic}} spirochetal disease {{caused by}} coming {{into contact with}} water or soil contaminated with urine of the infected animals such as sheep, hours, cow, rat and etc. Farmers, animal husbands, veterinarians and those practicing aqua sport are at risk. Materials and Methods: This study was undertaken in 13 villages of Ghaemshahr City (September 2004) in which because of previous epidemiological observation the probability of this disease was high. Study was descriptive cross sectional with randomized case selection. Five ml of venous blood was taken from each case and tested using an ELISA method. Information about age, sex, job, area of living, symptoms such as fever, headache, mialgia, diarrhea, nausea during <b>this</b> or <b>past</b> <b>summer</b> were gathered. Results: Serological data showed that prevalence of leptospirosis was 29. 4 %. There is no relation between sex and positive serological results (54. 8 % women & 54. 18 % men). Conclusion: Leptospirosis in studied area is epidemic and due to its high morbidity, mortality and economical impact,heath education to people would help to control the disease and chemoprophylaxis can also be used...|$|R

Pledging libraries also gain MARC records and COUNTER compliant usage statistics. Reveal Digital makes no claims on copyright to the material. After a designated period, the content will be made available as Open Access resources.

60|$|These {{three young}} people were neighbors' children, {{dwelling}} in houses that stood {{by the side of}} the great Lexington road, along a ridgy hill that rose abruptly behind them, its brow covered with a wood, and which stretched, with one or two breaks and interruptions, into the heart of the village of Concord, the county town. It was in the side of this hill that, according to tradition, the first settlers of the village had burrowed in caverns which they had dug out for their shelter, like swallows and woodchucks. As its slope was towards the south, and its ridge and crowning woods defended them from the northern blasts and snow-drifts, it was an admirable situation for the fierce New England winter; and the temperature was milder, by several degrees, along this hill-side than on the unprotected plains, or by the river, or in any other part of Concord. So that here, during the hundred years that had elapsed since the first settlement of the place, dwellings had successively risen close to the hill's foot, and the meadow that lay on the other side of the road--a fertile tract--had been cultivated; and these three {{young people were}} the children's children's children of persons of respectability who had dwelt there,--Rose Garfield, in a small house, the site of which is still indicated by the cavity of a cellar, in which I <b>this</b> very <b>past</b> <b>summer</b> planted some sunflowers to thrust their great disks out from the hollow and allure the bee and the humming-bird; Robert Hagburn, in a house of somewhat more pretension, a hundred yards or so nearer to the village, standing back from the road in the broader space which the retreating hill, cloven by a gap in that place, afforded; where some elms intervened between it and the road, offering a site which some person of a natural taste for the gently picturesque had seized upon. Those same elms, or their successors, still flung a noble shade over the same old house, which the magic hand of Alcott has improved by the touch that throws grace, amiableness, and natural beauty over scenes that have little pretension in themselves.|$|R
