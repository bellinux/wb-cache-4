25|$|Data {{from the}} {{scientific}} instruments was {{transmitted to the}} ground by two antennas. A 60 milliwatt transmitter fed a dipole antenna consisting of two fiberglass slot antennas {{in the body of}} the satellite operating on 108.03 MHz, and four flexible whips forming a <b>turnstile</b> <b>antenna</b> were fed by a 10 milliwatt transmitter operating on 108.00MHz.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can only have its polarization {{in the direction of}} that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop Yagi or log-periodic antenna with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical [...] "whip antenna" [...] or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A <b>turnstile</b> <b>antenna</b> with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation toward the horizon. However, when that same <b>turnstile</b> <b>antenna</b> is used in the [...] "axial mode" [...] (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} {{variations of}} the dipole are also used, such as the folded dipole, short dipole, cage dipole, bow-tie, and batwing antenna. Dipoles {{may be used as}} standalone antennas themselves, but they are also employed as feed antennas (driven elements) in many more complex antenna types, such as the Yagi antenna, parabolic antenna, reflective array, [...] <b>turnstile</b> <b>antenna,</b> [...] log periodic antenna, and phased array. The dipole was the earliest type of antenna; it was invented by German physicist Heinrich Hertz around 1886 in his pioneering investigations of radio waves.|$|E
50|$|Axial mode <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> {{are often}} used for {{satellite}} and missile antennas, since circular polarization is used in satellite communication. This is because with circularly polarized waves the relative orientation of the antenna elements {{does not affect the}} gain.|$|R
5000|$|Circular {{polarization}} {{was used}} for spacecraft (satellite and missile) communication, since circular polarization is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the antennas, and the space vehicle's antenna could have any orientation {{with respect to the}} ground antenna. High gain Yagi <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> were often used for the ground station.|$|R
50|$|Driven arrays - These are arrays {{in which}} the {{individual}} component antennas are all driven - connected to the transmitter or receiver. The individual antennas, which are usually identical, often consist of single driven elements, such as half-wave dipoles, but may also be composite antennas such as Yagi <b>antennas</b> or <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{directions}} {{perpendicular to}} its axis the antenna radiates linearly polarized radio waves (horizontally polarized when the antenna's axis is vertical). This is called normal mode. The radiation pattern, a superposition {{of the two}} dipole patterns, is close to omnidirectional but actually [...] "cloverleaf shaped", with four small maxima off {{the ends of the}} elements. The pattern departs from omnidirectional by only ±5 percent. [...] The radiation in these horizontal directions is often increased by vertically stacking multiple <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> (called [...] "bays") fed in phase. This increases the gain by strengthening the radiation in the desired horizontal directions but causes partial cancellation of the radiation in vertical directions, reducing power wasted radiated into the sky or down toward the earth. These stacked normal mode <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> are used at VHF and UHF frequencies for FM and television broadcasting.|$|R
5000|$|Brown's {{original}} patent described stacking multiple <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> vertically {{to make a}} {{high gain}} horizontally polarized omnidirectional antenna for radio broadcasting. [...] These were used {{for some of the}} first FM broadcasting antennas in the 1930s. However most modern FM broadcast antennas use circular polarization so the signal strength will not vary with the orientation of the receiver's antenna.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{normal mode}} <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> called superturnstile or batwing antennas {{are used as}} {{television}} broadcasting <b>antennas.</b> Axial mode <b>turnstiles</b> are widely used for satellite ground station antennas in the VHF and UHF bands, as circular polarization is often used for satellite communication since it is not sensitive to {{the orientation of the}} satellite antenna in space.|$|R

50|$|The short {{wavelengths}} also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small. High gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and UHF television reception are usually Yagi, log periodic, corner reflectors, or reflective array antennas. At {{the top end}} of the band slot antennas and parabolic dishes become practical. For satellite communication, helical, and <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> are used since satellites typically employ circular polarization which is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas. For television broadcasting specialized vertical radiators that are mostly modifications of the slot antenna or helical antenna are used: the slotted cylinder, zig-zag, and panel antennas.|$|R

5000|$|For {{directional}} antennas, the Yagi antenna is {{the most}} widely used as a high gain or [...] "beam" [...] antenna. For television reception, the Yagi is used, as well as the log periodic antenna due to its wider bandwidth. Helical and <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> are used for satellite communication since they employ circular polarization. For even higher gain, multiple Yagis or helicals can be mounted together to make array antennas. Vertical collinear arrays of dipoles {{can be used to make}} high gain omnidirectional antennas, in which more of the antenna's power is radiated in horizontal directions. Television and FM broadcasting stations use collinear arrays of specialized dipole antennas such as batwing antennas.|$|R

40|$|NTNU {{is aiming}} {{to build and}} launch a small student {{satellite}} compliant with thedouble CubeSat standard, by 2014. The NTNU Test Satellite (NUTS) will carrytwo radio tranceivers and a beacon transmitter, all located in the VHF and UHFamateur bands. The goal of this thesis was to build the whole antenna systems forthe spacecraft. <b>Turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> were chosen both for UHF and VHF, since they yield thehighest received signal strength on ground throughout the whole pass of the satel-lite. In order to reach this conclusion, a study of how the choice of spacecraftantennas dynamically influence the link margin was carried out. Furthermore, theantennas was made by measuring tape, and is to be wrapped around the satelliteuntil deployment. This is for the satellite to be within the size constraints of adouble CubeSat during launch. The measuring tape will be tightened to the satel-lites body by nylon thread, which will be burnt off by Nichrome-wire to release themeasuring tape when the satellite is in-orbit. The measuring tape is mounted inbetween two circuit boards constituting the internal part of the antenna module. The feeding network is encapsulated by these two circuit boards. The module ismade such that the antenna complies with the CubeSat standard, and such that itcan be integrated with other modules on-board the satellite, such as the camera. Feeding the antennas turned out more difficult than first anticipated. Whereasconventional feeding networks for <b>turnstile</b> <b>antennas</b> typically comprises baluns andarrangements of coaxial cable comparable to the wavelength, such solutions are notfeasible within the satellite due to size constraints. As a result a lumped feedingnetwork was designed, that could be mounted {{on one of the}} circuit boards. Because of the many reactive components in the feeding network, it becamenecessary to determine how deviations in component values affect the performanceof the circuit. Statistical simulations was performed, and the deviations may causean unbalance between the amplitudes and phases of the outputs. But this resultsin less than half a dB additional losses in the link budget. A refinement of electromagnetic antenna simulations from previous work wasalso carried out. With this, the performance of the antennas was verified, andtheir lengths were optimized to yield the best possible match. The VHF antenna isnear-ideal both in terms of pattern and matching. The pattern of the UHF antennais somewhat distorted, but it is still considered to be the best suited antenna ofthose considered. The matching of the UHF antenna could have been better, butis considered acceptable. Moreover, the mutual coupling between the VHF andUHF antennas were studied, with the conclusion that the antennas may very wellco-exist on-board the satellite. Finally, both the feeding network and the VHF antenna were successfully builtand tested. The feeding network had an insertion loss of less than 2 dB, whereas thepattern of the antenna was measured to be near-ideal. Unfortunately, a fault hasoccurred on the UHF feeding network, which also prohibits the pattern for the UHFantenna to be measured. Nonetheless, all the parts constituting it has been built,and all the necessary simulations are done. Previous and future troubleshooting ofthe feeding network is also discussed...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>turnstile</b> <b>antenna,</b> or crossed-dipole antenna, is a radio antenna {{consisting}} {{of a set of}} two identical dipole antennas mounted at right angles to each other and fed in phase quadrature; the two currents applied to the dipoles are 90° out of phase.
