They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will.</b> I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
500|$|Pembleton and Lange grow closer; Lange {{experiences}} {{more pain}} as time passes, and switches among remorse, anger, and casual small talk during their conversations. Later, Pembleton holds Lange's hand {{to comfort him}} and confides about his recent stroke. Bayliss grows suspicious when Biedron says that he cannot recall his last place of work or {{when he moved to}} Baltimore. Biedron eventually admits that he had been criminally charged and placed into a psychiatric ward for pushing a man in front of a Chicago subway train for no reason. Biedron is arrested, and Bayliss confirms to Pembleton that Lange was pushed; Pembleton decides not to tell Lange because he does not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> comfort him, but Lange figures it out for himself by observing their conversation. Lange experiences greater pain and starts to lose consciousness. After saying [...] "I'm OK" [...] to Pembleton, Lange falls unconscious and the EMTs push the train with the airbags. Lange dies immediately after he is removed. A shocked and disoriented Pembleton leaves the subway and, after staring at Biedron {{in the back of a}} police squad car, walks to his vehicle while recalling a line about how sugar maple leaves behave when it rains (a line that Lange said as he was dying). He then drives away with Bayliss. The episode ends with Flannigan jogging past the subway station.|$|E
2500|$|Coker {{also came}} under fire for some of his {{comments}} after the incident. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> affect the image of our program greatly, but in a positive way," [...] he said. [...] "I think that {{when they see the}} video and they see how it was handled they will be impressed with our players." [...] His handling of the incident contributed to speculation that he would not return in 2007, Shalala's vote of confidence notwithstanding.|$|E

60|$|The Doctor {{strongly}} advises that Europa and I {{should go}} before long and {{settle in the}} Cathay region. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be a most excellent field for me to begin my labors in, and he knows many families there who would doubtless give me their practice.|$|R

"Your father <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be {{for your}} good, my boy," [...] she said, [...] "and I {{have no doubt}} that you will enjoy {{yourself}} greatly,--but be sure to be careful, and don't let your high spirits get you into scrapes;-- remember how valuable your life is to us!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{more recent}} 2005 interview, he cited the band's various side {{projects}} as a reason, stating that [...] "I truly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> maybe never happen as we all have full diaries, families, full time jobs and mortgages... I for instance give lessons and I play in 2 other bands... But we will seriously consider it this time, as {{it will be very}} difficult to get all the guys of the band together to go on tour. Besides it was never our intention in the first place to do live gigs as SG is most and for all a real studio band. Maybe, some day, never say never…." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{finds that}} the Legislation has not {{indicated}} {{what is meant by}} 'fair and reasonable,' what is the model or criterion by which fairness and reasonableness are to be determined. It is to be regretted that the Legislature has not given a definition of the words. It is the function of the Legislature, not of the Judiciary, to deal with social and economic problems; [...] it is for the Judiciary to apply, and, when necessary, interpret the enactments of the Legislature. But here this whole controversial problem, with its grave social and economic bearings, has been committed to a judge, who is not, at least directly, responsible, and who ought not to be responsible to public opinion. even if the delegation of duties should be successful in this case, it by no means follows that it will be so hereafter. I do not protest against the difficulty of the problem, but against the confusion of functions and against the failure to define, the shunting of legislative responsibility. It would be almost as reasonable to tell a Court to do what is 'right' with regard to real estate, and yet lay down no laws or principles for its guidance. In the course of the long discussion of this case, I have been convinced that the President of this Court is put in a false position. The strength of the Judiciary in the public confidence is largely owing {{to the fact that the}} judge has not to devise great principles of action as between great classes, or to lay down what is fair and reasonable between contending interests in the community; but has to carry out mandates of the Legislature evolved out of the conflict of public opinion after debate in Parliament. I venture to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not be found wise to bring the judicial department within the range of political fire....|$|E

[...] "In the first place, it is {{probable}} that they will try to burn us out, tonight; and we could not hope to prevent their piling faggots against the doors, in the dark. For that reason, alone, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be much better to attack them than wait for them to attack us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed; {{my father}} <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{be very good}} {{for me to see}} {{something}} of foreign countries, and especially Flanders. As there is nothing doing here now, I am wasting my time, and doubtless in the great Flemish cities I shall be able to find masters who can teach me many things with the sword." ...|$|R

He has {{considered}} of his bargain; he has shown it to his friend; he is even rather proud of it; he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> suit him, and may be had sufficiently cheap; and he will buy to-morrow. God, that I have lived for this, and that I feel it!' ...|$|R

Ungureanu “Dincolo de text: HYPERTEXTUL” 1, which contains a profound linguistic analysis of a conceptual triad: text – intertext – hypertext. In this hardback edition the author gives rise to theoretical discussion of the afore-mentioned concepts and suggests making them the main ones in the general theory of text. E.

2500|$|Burnside, at Halleck's request, {{submitted}} {{a plan to}} create a ruse at Culpeper and Gordonsville, while the brunt of his force took Fredericksburg, {{then moved on to}} Richmond. Halleck's response was sent on November 14: [...] "The President has just assented to your plan. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> succeed, if you move rapidly; otherwise not." [...] The following Battle of Fredericksburg was a disaster, and the Army of the Potomac was handily defeated.|$|R

[...] "Father O'Leary is loyal to the backbone, {{although}} {{he has his own}} ideas as to the hopelessness of our obtaining any efficient help from Louis. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be far better to trust to our friends at home, and that, even did Louis carry out his promises, it would in the long run harm rather than benefit King James." ...|$|R
50|$|In the mid-90's, Jolie Jolson, a white {{high school}} student (the {{great-grandson}} of blackface performer Al Jolson) wants {{to be on the}} basketball team because he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> bring him closer to being the one thing that he isn't: black. His African American girlfriend, Henrietta, is pregnant with another man's baby and had a seedy past which includes appearing in a sex tape. Jolie gets on the basketball team due to a large donation from his well-off father, and ends up dating one of the cheerleaders for the team, and accidentally impregnates her.|$|R

50|$|Though {{this issue}} {{generally}} includes changing a persons' skin colour to be lighter, it also works {{the other way}} around. If the advertiser <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> help them to reach their specific target audience, the change is usually hastily made {{with the help of}} digital manipulation. For example, in 2001, the skin colour of Jason Williams, basketball player, was manipulated digitally by Nike for an advertising campaign where they changed his skin colour from white to black. This received backlash for racially abusing Asian fans and fines were placed.|$|R
6000|$|... "King Henry is old, Guy; {{and they}} say that his son is as full of spirit and as fiery as his father is {{peaceful}} and indisposed for war. When the king dies, my lord <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be but a short time before the English banner will be unfurled in France; {{and this is one of}} the reasons why he consented to my becoming an hostage, thinking that no long time is likely to elapse before he will have English backing, and will be able to disregard the threats of France." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{actually}} ill, Roland, though {{almost out}} of my mind at times; but I trust <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is nearly over. Your letter has given me new life, for it has made me hope that this black cloud which has fallen over me will be cleared away, and that I can again lift up my head and look my fellow-men in the face. I am ready now to give myself up, if Mr. Fernlea <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be the best thing for me to do, and to stand my trial. Before, I had nothing, save a bare negative, to oppose the evidence against me. Now there is at least a story to tell." ...|$|R

Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine.

Easter will be here in a fortnight, and then I shall see Mr. Simmonds and get him to apply at once. I met him in the street only last week, and he was talking about <b>it</b> then. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not be long after he sends in an application before I get my commission. He says he has got interest in London at the Horse Guards, and will get the application of the lord lieutenant backed up there; so I hope that {{in a couple of months}} at latest <b>it</b> <b>will</b> all be settled." ...|$|R
