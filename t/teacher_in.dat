The sample consisted of 53 mathematics teachers from urban secondary schools and 56 mathematics teachers from rural secondary schools drawn from a population of secondary school mathematics <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> England. The Assessment Practices Inventory (API) was used to collect data from the participants in the study. The independent sample t- test was used to analyze the data in the study.
