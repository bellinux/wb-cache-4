5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
25|$|Changes in the cloud, {{suggesting}} {{its small}} extent, were discovered by Carl Lampland in 1921. That same year, John Charles Duncan {{demonstrated that the}} remnant is expanding, while Knut Lundmark noted its proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> star of 1054.|$|E

The police soon arrived and tried to negotiate with Bryant for many hours before the battery in the phone he was using died, ending communication. Bryant's only demand was to be transported in an army helicopter to an airport. Sometime during the negotiations, Bryant killed his hostage.|$|E
25|$|Carson's show {{launched}} {{the careers of}} many performers, especially comedians and musicians. For a comedian appearing on the show, getting him to laugh and being invited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> chair were considered the highest honor. Most notable among these were David Letterman, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Jeff Foxworthy, Ellen DeGeneres, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, Tim Allen, Drew Carey, and Roseanne Barr. Carson was successor to The Ed Sullivan Show as a showcase {{for all kinds of}} talent, as well as continuing a vaudeville-style variety show.|$|E
25|$|Download Play {{allows users}} to play local {{multiplayer}} games with other Nintendo 3DS systems using only one Game Card. Players must have their systems within wireless range (up to approximately 65 feet) of {{each other for the}} guest system to download the necessary data from the host system. Download Play on Nintendo 3DS systems is also backward compatible, meaning that it is also available for Nintendo DS games. Unlike Download Play on Nintendo DS, game data, once downloaded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> system, is stored on the system's SD card, no longer requiring a re-download for a future game session. Nintendo 3DS games can only transfer a maximum of 32MB of data to other systems while in download play. Other forms of local multiplayer modes require each player to own the software that is currently being used.|$|E

25|$|Child {{partitions}} do {{not have}} direct access to hardware resources, but instead have a virtual view of the resources, in terms of virtual devices. Any request to the virtual devices is redirected via the VMBus to the devices in the parent partition, which will manage the requests. The VMBus is a logical channel which enables inter-partition communication. The response is also redirected via the VMBus. If the devices in the parent partition are also virtual devices, it will be redirected further until it reaches the parent partition, where it will {{gain access to the}} physical devices. Parent partitions run a Virtualization Service Provider (VSP), which connects to the VMBus and handles device access requests from child partitions. Child partition virtual devices internally run a Virtualization Service Client (VSC), which redirect the request to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus. This entire process is transparent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> OS.|$|E
25|$|Version 2.5 brought {{support for}} USB 2.0 devices, which {{expanded}} {{the number of}} USB devices supported at native speed, including support for built in iSight USB web-cams. The amount of video RAM allocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> OS was made adjustable, up to 32MB. Full featured CD/DVD drives arrived in this version, which allowed the user to burn disks directly in the virtual environment, and play any copy-protected CD or DVD as one would in Mac OS X. In addition, a shared clipboard and drag-drop support between Mac OS X and the guest OS was implemented. This version brought the ability for users with a Windows XP installation to upgrade to Windows Vista from within the VM environment. A new feature known as Coherence was added, which removed the Windows chrome, desktop, and the virtualization frames {{to create a more}} seamless desktop environment between Windows and Mac OS X applications. This version also allowed users to boot their existing Boot Camp Windows XP partitions, which eliminated the need to have multiple Windows installations on their Mac. A tool called Parallels Transporter was included to allow users to migrate their Windows PC, or existing VMware or Virtual PC VMs to Parallels Desktop for Mac.|$|E

The episode received Nielsen ratings of 1.7/3 percent, which were lower than the previous week's episode. The critical response was negative, directed mainly at plot holes and characterisation. However, the two part story has been named {{as one of the best}} storylines seen in Enterprise.|$|E
500|$|The Annenbergs contributed {{substantially}} to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, {{and upon}} Reagan's election in 1981, Lee Annenberg was named as Chief of Protocol of the United States. This position placed her {{in charge of}} advising the President, Vice President, and Secretary of State on matters dealing with diplomatic protocol, and formally welcoming foreign dignitaries upon their arrival to the United States. Annenberg oversaw a staff of 60 who worked on myriad details, ranging from {{the choice of the}} state gifts that will be given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest,</b> to the bathrooms the foreign delegation may visit. She said of her position, [...] "It's all about making your guests feel respected and welcome". Annenberg attracted some controversy during her tenure when she curtsied before the visiting Prince Charles upon arriving for a diplomatic visit, commentators saying it was unseemly in a republic which gained its independence from the same monarchy.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{liked the}} episode {{because of its}} [...] "non-stop one liners and great guest cameos." [...] Sassone's only {{complaint}} was that the Jack, Nancy, and Avery love triangle be over, pointing {{out that he was}} sick of seeing Jack running around trying to keep Avery and Nancy from seeing each other. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that [...] "we got one of the best episode titles of any show this year", and was favorable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> spots from Jon Hamm, Dean Winters, and Michael Sheen, observing [...] "he episode joyfully gave us three great pairings for Liz to deal with, each presenting their own unique set of laughs." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating. Linda Holmes for National Public Radio said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was [...] "very funny", and commented that her favorite scene was when Liz visited Drew in hopes that the two can get back together.|$|E

500|$|Jason Gray-Stanford listed [...] "Mr. Monk and the Airplane" [...] {{among his}} three {{favorite}} episodes of the series. Moreover, it was positively received by critics. In The Futon Critic's ranking of the fifty best episodes of 2002, it was placed 32nd, with Brian Ford Sullivan stating, [...] "The {{title of the}} episode says it all for us." [...] New York Daily Newss David Bianculli declared [...] "It seems that {{lots of people are}} getting on board with Monk, which is as it should be", referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> stars of the episode. The guests were said {{to be one of the}} [...] "many subtle and silly pleasures" [...] of the episode by Kevin McDonough, a critic for the United Feature Syndicate, while a TelevisionWeek reviewer praised Marshall performance as a [...] " [...] guest shot". Austin Smith of the New York Post deemed it [...] "a true classic" [...] and said it put [...] "Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan" [...] "to shame". Chris Hicks from Deseret News qualified it as [...] "perfection," [...] and Bianculli stressed [...] "the writing team for Monk made the most" [...] of it. On the other hand, Joy Press of The Village Voice called it [...] "a Seinfeld-like device" [...] in which Monk's fear of flying was explored [...] "to the point of exhaustion." ...|$|E
500|$|The AI {{functions}} {{were divided}} into three different categories: [...] "meta", which governed the environment and in-game progression; [...] "character", which was devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> and non-playable characters (NPCs); and [...] "navigation", which determined the best route and pattern for characters and other moving elements such as enemies to travel. The tasks assigned to the meta-AI were so numerous and large that {{it needed to be}} divided into separate interconnected elements, which included implementing a hierarchical structure for task management, transitioning and the merger of functions to create an intelligent system, and the exchange of various elements with specific localities. For the character-AI, a major point was the coordination between the AI and character animations when responding to different situations. Different levels and styles of AI were created for different groups of non-playable characters within XVs world, from the main party members to NPCs around the world. To ensure the navigation-AI worked properly for enemies and monsters, a system dubbed the [...] "Point Query System" [...] (PQS) was created, which could direct and steer them in a realistic manner while avoiding collisions with objects in the environment or other moving elements. A PQS was created for each enemy type, and made small changes to their behaviors easier to implement. The decision to create high-quality reactive AI for Noctis' companions helped influence the choice of making Noctis the only playable character.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{called it}} a [...] "fantastic episode" [...] and rated it 8 out of 10. He enjoyed all the subplots, and the performances by Paul Reubens and Isabella Rossellini. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that Reubens and Rossellini were [...] "pretty inspired choices", and said that [...] "Tracy as the devil, Kenneth as the angel" [...] gagin which Tracy was encouraging Pete to cheat on his wife while Kenneth told him not towas also [...] "inspired". TV Guides Matt Mitovich was favorable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> appearances of Reubens, Rossellini, and Will Forte, but said that Reubens's role [...] "served up a memorable majesty on a very strong, very laugh-out-loud funny installment" [...] of this episode. Mitovich was impressed with how [...] "Black Tie" [...] handled Liz's [...] "date" [...] with Jack, citing that lesser shows would have [...] "gone there" [...] in the final scene, [...] "and really jacked up the 'tension' between its two leads, but Tina Fey and her crack writing staff didn't. They kept it 99.44 percent light, meaning we now won't... be wondering, 'What if...?'" [...] {{in regard to the}} episode itself, Mitovich said it was an [...] "awesome episode, an immeasurably enjoyable, laugh-inducing series." [...] Seattle Post-Intelligencer contributor Melanie McFarland said that Reubens was [...] "perfectly cast as such a freak", though in regard to Rossellini's appearance [...] "he glides in playing the class act we're used to, but when Rossellini dissolves into a shocking mess, she yields one of the series' most absurd scenes yet." [...] It was rated the 28th greatest TV episode of all time on TV Guide's list.|$|E
