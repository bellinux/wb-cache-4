5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities at <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared {{in the form of the}} Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E

Stein commented that when he became a manager it was difficult to learn pitching after all the years of being a position player. In 1989, the New York Mets fired Butch Hobson, the manager of the Class-A Columbia Mets, and promoted Stein to that position. At <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Colombia that year, Stein led them to a 73–67 record.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the British victory at Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and other {{military}} reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. In May 1943, to ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the Supreme High Command announce that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel at <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
