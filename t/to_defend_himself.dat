5|$|If {{the late}} queen would have {{believed}} her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces and made their kings of figs and oranges as in old times. But her Majesty did all by halves, and by petty invasions taught the Spaniard how <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> and to see his own weakness.|$|E

Before disappearing into another dimension, Morlun declares that all spiders will die.|$|E
5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official admission of the attacking submarine's identity. Subsequently, most sources assumed as fact Nakagawa's and I-177s role in the loss of Centaur. Nakagawa refused to speak {{on the subject of the}} attack on Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II, even <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> or deny the claims made by Rohwer's and Sakamoto's works, and died in 1991.|$|E
5|$|He stays {{the night}} at a hotel, where he barely escapes an {{assassination}} attempt and then flees from a chase by an armed mob. From that point forward, Jack is forced to sneak through the alleys, buildings and sewers of Innsmouth, avoiding murderous patrols of the town's corrupt police and the cultists looking for him. He acquires weapons <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> and meets undercover agent Lucas Mackey, who tells him that the town is under federal investigation.|$|E
50|$|He {{is further}} {{alleged to have}} written {{anonymously}} {{in support of the}} Exclusion Bill, and to have given such offence by his ‘Catastrophe Mundi’ that he was brought before the privy council, but <b>to</b> have <b>defended</b> <b>himself</b> so skilfully that no charge could be established against him.|$|R
50|$|Codde, {{who succeeded}} Neercassel in 1686 went further than his {{predecessor}} {{and refused to}} sign the formulary.

5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political {{interpretation of the}} sermon for his own political gain; the see of Derry had just opened and Evans wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an inspection of the clergy of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> his sermons, and his politics, and instead of resolving the issue, only caused more dispute between the two.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics argue}} that Swift did not need <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat. However, {{the essence of the}} letter {{encourages}} the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.|$|E

5000|$|After Shyster's first appearance, Gottfredson made {{no further}} {{references}} to his profession as a lawyer, {{apart from his}} name.

50|$|In 820, Leo V accused {{his former}} comrade-in-arms Michael of conspiring against him. Michael was imprisoned but his co-conspirators {{organized}} {{the assassination of}} Leo in the cathedral Hagia Sophia on Christmas, 820. Leo had entered the cathedral unarmed and was thus unable <b>to</b> successfully <b>defend</b> <b>himself.</b> Michael succeeded him as Emperor with Thekla becoming the new Empress.|$|R
5|$|Tucker {{was asked}} for reimbursement, and after negotiation, paid it in part, {{borrowing}} the remainder {{from members of}} the academy board. He also acted as custodian of other funds, blended them with his own and spent it on overindulgence and land speculation. Later he was required <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly.

Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.|$|E
5|$|Furious, Presto {{tries to}} attack Alec, {{but in an}} act <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> Alec puts an offstage ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit between his legs. Presto {{attempts}} to hit Alec with it, but it misses and hits a backstage door, and Presto ends up getting pushed across the stage. Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder. Alec furiously retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's fingers go into, shocking Presto into dancing wildly to bluegrass music.|$|E
5|$|Light gun {{shooters}} primarily {{revolve around}} shooting {{large numbers of}} enemies attacking in waves. The protagonist may be required <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> by taking cover, or by shooting incoming thrown weapons, such as axes or grenades. The player may also compete against the clock, however, with some games also featuring boss battles. Games may also reward the player for accurate shooting, with extra points, power-ups or secrets. Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects, testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames.|$|E
50|$|Gaines was {{in command}} of the Army's Western Division at the {{outbreak}} of the Mexican-American War.

5|$|Manhattan {{shares a}} final kiss with Jupiter before departing {{permanently}} to another galaxy, while an enraged Dreiberg attacks Veidt, who makes no effort <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself.</b> Nevertheless, he defends his actions, claiming that for world peace to be possible, {{there had to}} be sacrifice. Dreiberg rejects his logic declaring that Veidt has deformed and mutilated humanity. Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, an editor of the New Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on. The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of crank mailings, among which is Rorschach's journal.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley {{and his friends were}} fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> in print.|$|E
5|$|Skinner is {{a former}} Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. In the war he once killed a boy at a very short distance, an {{experience}} which has scarred him for life. He is married to Sharon Skinner. He has been treated at a sleep disorder clinic, suffering from recurring dreams of an old woman, which may either be a hallucination arising from drug use during Vietnam or a succubus. Skinner's hobbies include jogging and boxing, the latter {{of which has been}} shown in his ability to outfight Fox Mulder and X and <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> reasonably well when he was attacked by Alex Krycek and his men.|$|E
50|$|After turning age 20 {{a little}} more than two weeks prior, Jones fought Alfonso Gomez at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, CA. on August 25, 2006. Throughout the match Gomez aggressively {{pressured}} an outmatched Jones, eventually winning a premature and controversial stoppage in the eighth and final round. Jones was clearly unharmed and able <b>to</b> continue <b>defending</b> <b>himself</b> but the referee declared a TKO.|$|R
50|$|A “technical knockout” (TKO) is {{possible}} as well, and is {{ruled by the}} referee, fight doctor, or a fighter’s corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable <b>to</b> effectively <b>defend</b> <b>himself.</b> There is also the “three-knockdown rule”, in which three knockdowns in a single round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter’s record.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Amitabh was {{suspended}} while posted as {{the superintendent of}} police (SP) at Gonda. He was accused of issuing an arms licence <b>to</b> criminals.

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set inside an ancient Egyptian tomb. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to escape the tomb, the Great Sphinx, before all oxygen runs out. To achieve this end, the player must navigate a series of chambers linked by corridors, solve logic puzzles and deal with hostile enemies by either avoiding or fighting them. The tomb has seven floors. Pendragon's only form of defence is his whip, which he can utilise <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> from enemies. The player also has access to a torch, which {{will allow them to}} see in certain pitch-black areas of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A {{year after the}} war ended, Hindman's brother, Robert, engaged {{in a fight with}} William Falkner because he thought that Falkner had tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the Sons of Temperance. Robert Hindman tried <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury which ruled that he was acting in self-defense. Afterward, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial. Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. The tense relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the Memphis, Tennessee Appeal.|$|E
5|$|Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress {{are forced}} to muzzle Lad when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, Lad falls {{out of the car}} and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, Lad starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle.

Shamrock and the crowd were furious at the early stoppage and Dana White immediately put together a rematch on television.|$|R
