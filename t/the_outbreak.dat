40|$|Two {{outbreaks}} of fowl cholera on a multi-age free range egg farm were investigated. <b>The</b> <b>outbreaks</b> occurred in 1994 and 2002. A total of 22 strains of P. multocida {{were available for}} study – 11 from <b>the</b> 1994 <b>outbreak</b> and 11 from <b>the</b> 2002 <b>outbreak.</b> Lesions typical of acute fowl cholera were seen in <b>the</b> 1994 <b>outbreak,</b> whereas both acute and chronic FC occurred in <b>the</b> 2002 <b>outbreak.</b> <b>The</b> isolates were examined in an extended phenotypic typing methodology, by a P. multocida-specific PCR, by the Heddleston somatic serotyping scheme and by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) typing using the enzyme HpaII. All 22 strains had the same phenotypic properties, all were confirmed as P. multocida by PCR, all were Hedddleston serovar 4, and all had the same REA pattern. Our results indicate that these two outbreaks were caused by the same clone of P. multocida – despite the eight year time period between <b>the</b> <b>outbreaks...</b>|$|R

Guy et al. (2) report the genomes of eight additional E. coli O 104 :H 4 isolates sampled from <b>the</b> German <b>outbreak.</b> By focusing on the numbers of SNPs in their samples, they suggest that <b>the</b> German <b>outbreak</b> is more diverse than we reported and is similar to <b>the</b> French <b>outbreak.</b> In fact, Guy et al. ’s data (2) strongly support our conclusion that <b>the</b> German <b>outbreak</b> represents a clade within the diversity...|$|R
