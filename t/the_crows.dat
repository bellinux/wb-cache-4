In September 1887 the young medicine man Wraps-Up-His-Tail, or Sword Bearer, led {{a small group of}} warriors in a raid against a group of Blackfoot which had captured horses from <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> reservation. Following <b>the</b> raid, Sword Bearer led his group back to <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> Agency to inform the Indian agent of his victory, but, an incident arose which ended with the young leader taking his followers into the mountains.

5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call {{is similar}} in {{character}} {{to that of other}} corvids, particularly the jackdaw, although it is clearer and louder than the call of that species.

5|$|Apart {{from its}} greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, <b>the</b> <b>crows,</b> {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crows</b> put up 300 tipis near a Mandan {{village on}} the Missouri in 1825. The representatives of the US {{government}} waited for them. Mountain Crow chief Long Hair (Red Plume at Forehead) and fifteen other Crows signed the first treaty of friendship and trade between <b>the</b> <b>Crows</b> and the United States on August 4. With {{the signing of the}} document, <b>the</b> <b>Crows</b> also recognized the supremacy of the United States, if they actually understood the word. River Crow chief Arapooish had left the treaty area in disgust. By help of the thunderbird he had to send a farewell shower down on the whites and the Mountain Crows.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crowing</b> by <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> is also {{considered}} an omen or message either that a letter (news) {{will come from}} relatives not heard from for a long time, or that some unexpected guests/visitors will arrive.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1834, <b>the</b> <b>Crows</b> (maybe led by chief Arapooish) tried to shut down Fort McKenzie at the Missouri in Blackfeet country. The {{apparent}} motive was to stop the trading post's sale to their Indian enemies. Although later described as a month long siege of the fort, it lasted only two days. The opponents exchanged a few shots and {{the men in the}} fort fired a canon, but no real harm came to anyone. <b>The</b> <b>Crows</b> left four days before the arrival of a Blackfeet band. The episode seems to be the worst armed conflict between <b>the</b> <b>Crows</b> and a group of whites until the Sword Bearer uprising in 1887.|$|E
25|$|In the {{preliminary}} final against the Western Bulldogs, McLeod, {{who had been}} playing primarily as a forward or half-back flanker was placed into the midfield {{in the second half}} by Blight in an effort to spark <b>the</b> <b>Crows</b> side who trailed by 31 points at half-time.

25|$|The natural diet of many corvid {{species is}} omnivorous, {{consisting}} of invertebrates, nestlings, small mammals, berries, fruits, seeds, and carrion. However, some corvids, especially <b>the</b> <b>crows,</b> have adapted well to human conditions and {{have come to}} rely on anthropogenic foods. In a US study of American crows, common ravens and Steller's jays around campgrounds and human settlements, <b>the</b> <b>crows</b> appeared to have the most diverse diet of all, taking anthropogenic foods such as bread, spaghetti, fried potatoes, dog food, sandwiches, and livestock feed. The increase in available anthropogenic food sources is contributing to population increase in some corvid species.|$|E
