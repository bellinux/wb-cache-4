40|$|Direct {{manipulation}} {{has been}} lauded {{as a good}} form of interface design, and some interfaces that have this property have been well received by users. In this article we seek a cognitive account of both {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of direct manipulation interfaces. We identify two underlying phenomena that give rise to the feeling <b>of</b> <b>directness.</b> One deals with the information processing distance between the user’s intentions and the facilities provided by the ma-chine. Reduction of this distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies of the inter-face language. In particular, direct manipulation requires that the system pro-vide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the feeling <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> <b>of</b> manipulation...|$|R
40|$|Indirect {{speech is}} a {{phenomenon}} in which a speaker says something he does not literally mean, knowing that the listener will probably understand it correctly. One {{of the most recent}} theories of indirect speech, the theory of the strategic speaker, states that indirect speech is not just a social ritual (a technique of politeness used to save the interlocutor's face), but also a logical strategy. Therefore, indirect speech provides the speaker with an opportunity to deny the real meaning of his words and protect himself when the words do not take root. The aim of this research was to investigate whether {{there is a difference between}} the perception of the clarity of the speech act, the listener's certainty about the real meaning of the speaker's speech act, and the perception of the mutual knowledge shared by the speaker and the listener with regard to the level <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> <b>of</b> the speech act. It was expected that the variable <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> <b>of</b> the speech act will affect the change in mentioned dependent variables. A total of 134 students (101 females and 33 males) from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Rijeka participated in the research. All respondents read two scenarios of conversation which described an event after which one of the actors gives feedback to another actor in the form of disagreement. In both scenarios the same feedback speech acts which varied from the most direct speech act (You are wrong.) to the most indirect speech act (It is really difficult to find the right solution to this problem.) were used. The research has shown that there is a difference in the perception of the mutual knowledge shared by the speaker and the listener with regard to the level <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> <b>of</b> the speech act. The more direct the speech act, the higher the perceptions of mutual knowledge. The same pattern was obtained for perception of the listener's certainty about the real meaning of the speech act as well as for perception of the clarity of the speech act...|$|R

40|$|Escape theory {{predicts that}} flight {{initiation}} distance (FID = predator-prey distance when escape begins) increases as predation risk increases. We <b>tested</b> effects <b>of</b> variation of approach speed and directness, predator persistence, concealment, and weather conditions on FID in the Balearic lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) by ourselves simulating predators. We examined effects <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> <b>of</b> approach on probability of fleeing and of repeated approach on entering refuge and distance fled. As predicted, FID was greater for faster approach speed, more direct approach, during second than first approaches, and when lizards were exposed than partially concealed. Other effects <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> <b>of</b> approach and repeated approach also were as predicted by greater assessed risk by the lizards. The proportion of individuals that fled was greater for direct than indirect approaches. The proportion of lizards that entered refuges and distance fled were greater {{during the second}} of two successive approaches. Effects of weather on FID were complex. FID was shortest in the warmest conditions with no noticeable wind, when lizards were active. Lizards were inactive and basked in the other conditions. FID was longest at 20 °C without wind, and intermediate FID occurred at 18 °C in windy conditions. We present hypotheses for weather effects. Tests are needed to unravel effects of temperature and wind speed. All predictions of escape theory for simple risk factors, i. e., all except than weather conditions, were confirmed. Escape theory successfully predicts FID for these risks in P. lilfordi, other lacertids, and more broadly, in ecologically and taxonomically diverse lizards...|$|R

40|$|Background: Since {{the advent}} of {{microarray}} technology, numerous methods have been devised to infer gene regulatory relationships from gene expression data. Many approaches that infer entire regulatory networks. This produces results that are rich in information and yet so complex that they are often of limited usefulness for researchers. One alternative unit of regulatory interactions is a linear path between genes. Linear paths are more comprehensible than networks and still contain important information. Such paths can be extracted from inferred regulatory networks or inferred directly. Since criteria for inferring networks generally differs from criteria for inferring paths, indirect and direct inference of paths may achieve different results. Results: This paper explores a strategy to infer linear pathways by converting the path inference problem into a shortest-path problem. The edge weights used are the negative log-transformed probabilities <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> derived from the posterior joint distributions of pairwise mutual information between gene expression levels. Directness is inferred using the data processing inequality. The method was designed with two goals. One is to achieve better accuracy in path inference than extraction of paths from inferred networks. The other is to facilitate priorization of interactions for laboratory validation. A method is proposed for achieving this by ranking paths according to the joint probability <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> <b>of</b> each path’s edges. The algorithm is evaluated using simulated expression data an...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{the impact of}} a direct communication style on the establishment of trust in intercultural business settings. A qualitative research approach was chosen as it was the aim of this {{research project}} to capture and evaluate participants’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> and its impact on trustworthiness, owing to underlying cultural values and beliefs of participants. The focus group method was chosen as a stand-alone method to collect rich and in-depth data. The group effect of the focus group method was significant for this research project as cultural differences were under examination. A critical incident approach was employed, and three different scenarios were discussed in each focus group. The three focus groups were culturally specific, and findings were compared across the focus group to identify culturally specific perceptions and patterns. Cultures under examination were the German and Chinese cultures, with New Zealand as a control group. Findings disclose an unexpected preference for a direct communication style in business settings from the Chinese participants, and hence, strongly support the call for more empirical research in this area. A variety of culturally specific factors were identified to impact participants’ willingness to trust another party, and findings indicate that the elements <b>of</b> <b>directness</b> and indirectness impact participants’ perceptions of another person’s trustworthiness...|$|R

For this purpose, a written method is chosen. One group of 40 students receive a written discourse completion task (DCT) with two situations that ask respondents to write emails on paper to an imaginary professor. This data is compared to earlier data collected from 27 students, where a group of students composed emails for the same situations and sent them electronically to their professor. Thus, while one group write emails to a hypothetical professor, the other group is provided with a real interlocutor.
