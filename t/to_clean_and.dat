5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on {{instruction}} from Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in contravention of a standing IDF order, <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> paint the compound that was burned three days before. As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which had been called to extract the others.|$|E

25|$|A severe {{thunderstorm}} in August 2010, part of {{a system}} that brought widespread flooding to several states, overflowed ravines.

25|$|Another {{consideration}} was education. Before {{the late}} 1950s and {{the advent of}} the stately home business, very few working-class people had seen the upstairs of these great houses; those that had were there only <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> serve, with an obligation to keep their eyes down, rather than uplift them and be educated. Thus ignorance of the nation's heritage was a large contributory factor to the indifference that met the destruction.|$|E

More often than not, mourners keep vigil overnight at graves, eating and making merry {{to pass the time}} and keep the dead company. A popular children's pastime during such vigils is to gather candle wax from melted candles to either play with or sell to candlemakers.|$|E
25|$|It {{is found}} in {{abundant}} coral areas from sub-tidal reef flats to deeper lagoons and seaward reefs and has a depth of 40 meters. Unlike other cleaner wrasses, this fish spans larger areas <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> is cleans more during the day when it is active. It feeds on crustacean ectoparasites such as gnathiidae and fish mucus and, both individually and in groups, it will also clean sharks and rays such as grey reef shark, whitetip reef shark; Labroides bicolor will also clean other. At night, it may sleep in a mucous cocoon.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, {{silicone}} rubber dildos became more popular, {{a trend that}} has continued as the prices have lowered. These are easier <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> {{do not have the}} characteristic plastic aroma of PVC. They were expensive when introduced but are now reasonably priced, making them an excellent choice for the first-time user. Silicone holds body heat well, and is an excellent conductor of vibrations, allowing users to hold a vibrator at one end. Silicone is also a robust material (especially when compared to the cheap, unsafe jelly rubber that many dildos are made of) that can be sterilized by boiling or bleaching (using a bleach solution, diluted: 10% bleach 90% water).|$|E
25|$|Pfizer has {{inherited}} Wyeth's liabilities in the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site {{is highly}} toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> develop it for future profits and potential public uses. The Sierra Club and the Edison Wetlands Association {{have come out}} {{in opposition to the}} cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants to leach. The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil off site could expose cleanup workers. The EPA's position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste is a paste or gel {{dentifrice}} {{used with}} a toothbrush as an accessory <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Salt and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste. Toothpaste {{is not intended to}} be swallowed due to the fluoride content, but is generally not very harmful if accidentally swallowed in small amounts; however, one should seek medical attention after swallowing abnormally large amounts.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 3 January 1975, a fire {{broke out in the}} TVR factory, likely caused by faulty wiring in a 3000M factory {{demonstrator}} car. Several complete and nearly complete cars were destroyed, as well as many components in the company's stores. Soot and ash covered every surface, and the damage was estimated to be £200,000. A small team of office workers came in <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> perform administrative tasks while the insurance company made its assessment. The factory walls were sandblasted to remove the coating of soot, but the sand damaged many pieces of equipment that were not moved out first. Despite the lack of heat and electricity in the building, some limited amount of car construction began again. Four cars were completed in April, and then eight in May. Total production for the year was approximately 150 cars, and only about 20 of those were exported to the US, where Gerry Sagerman's business suffered as a result.|$|E
25|$|Some {{birds have}} {{a supply of}} powder down {{feathers}} which grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from {{the ends of the}} barbules. These particles produce a powder that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather conditioner. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder. Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to emulsifying agents due to human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by oil spills. The feathers of cormorants soak up water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged.|$|E
25|$|Between January and April 2015, peace {{negotiations}} in Havana {{showed signs of}} continued progress and growing international support. On February 20, United States Secretary of State John Kerry announced {{the appointment of a}} special envoy to the Colombian peace process, Bernard Aronson. The appointment was welcomed, including by the FARC, and interpreted as a clear endorsement of Colombia's peace process by the United States, long a key foreign player in the Colombian conflict. On February 27, former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan visited the negotiating table in Havana. On March 7, the negotiating parties in Cuba announced through joint communiqué the creation of a mine clearance pilot project, <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> decontaminate land from the presence of anti-personnel mines, improvised explosive devices and unexploded ordnances with the leadership and coordination of the Norwegian People’s Aid. The announcement was significant, as the FARC undertook to reveal the location of mines and suspending the planting of new ones in that territory, {{and it was the first}} aspect of the {{peace negotiations}} which would have an immediate impact on the ground. The pilot project was launched in the municipality of Briceño, Antioquia.|$|E
