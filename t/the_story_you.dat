When you start hearing the stories from a true perspective... of people who were {{actually}} there, it gives you a clear viewpoint of where you are as an artist and <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>you</b> would like to tell. It was a great experience to be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Pausch {{was then}} {{introduced}} by Steve Sea-bolt, {{who was the}} Vice President of Worldwide Publishing and Marketing at Electronic Arts, {{in addition to being}} Pausch's close friend and former co-worker. Sea-bolt began with a joke referring to Electronic Arts, and another joke about a bet he and Pausch had made about how many people would attend the lecture, saying that [...] "...depending upon whose version of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>you</b> hear, he either owes me 20 dollars or his new Volkswagen." [...] Seabolt began the next part of the introduction by talking about Pausch's academic achievements and previous career with the University of Virginia and Electronic Arts. Seabolt concluded his introduction by describing the qualities of Pausch, saying that [...] "Randy's dedication to making {{the world a better place}} is self evident to anyone who has crossed paths with him." [...] He described how his accomplishments had affected others, as well as his wife and three children. Seabolt then turned the speech over to Pausch, who was greeted with a standing ovation.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>you</b> want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kojima {{also said}} about her clothing, [...] "Once {{you see how}} she fits into <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>you</b> will {{understand}} why she looks the way she does. Without any of this background I can certainly understand why there are concerns. I will say there’s a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it’s all {{a part of the}} game, learning those reasons one by one." [...] Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy, but said [...] "When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn’t get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Rosenberg {{talked about}} the freedom that the series had, saying that it would go [...] "even further in all our storytelling" [...] than what Brian Michael Bendis did in the Alias comic: [...] "That's the beauty of working with Netflix. It's 13 [...] There's no pilot and then getting feedback, {{reaction}} and ratings. You're in this bubble. So, what's <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>you</b> want to tell? Where {{do you want to}} go with ?" [...] Expanding on this, Rosenberg said that [...] "we start off with [...] incredible source material and Jessica Jones isn’t as well known in the universe obviously as Daredevil and everyone else, so it really allows for a lot of freedom in there. So there are restrictions in terms of the Marvel niverse of certain rules of mythology, but within that it’s free pass". Rosenberg noted that the final series is very different to the version she developed for ABC because of the different mythology of the MCU.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Jackson, {{producer}} of the remake that later began, said in 2006 that [...] "It is not our intention to offend people. But really {{you are in a}} no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario: [...] If you change it, everyone's going to whinge and whine about political correctness. And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending a lot of people inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>you</b> can't just change [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Alex McClimens, whom Muller quoted above, also wrote, [...] "This {{magnificent}} {{essay in}} communication is compulsory reading {{for anyone with}} the slightest interest in autistic spectrum disorders. This book is also required reading for those who simply enjoy a fascinating story... we are offered a first person narrative to match anything by contemporary writers. Mark Haddon has created a true literary character and {{his handling of the}} teenage Asperger's heroic adventure is brilliantly crafted. He uses the literal mind-set of his hero to mask the true direction of the plot." [...] Reviewer Paul Moorehead calls the book [...] "a fairly ripping adventure story" [...] and writes, [...] "It's also quite a feat of writing. The actual use of language is somewhat austere—an unavoidable consequence of having a boy with autism as a narrator—but it has its own beauty, and it works. So persuasive and so effective is the construction of Christopher, not only is he a character you're rooting for, he's also the character in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>you</b> understand the best. It's startling how believably and comfortably this story puts you into what you might have thought were likely to be some pretty alien shoes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the game}} itself, the city remains nameless but is {{strongly}} influenced by the environs of Philadelphia. Cage cited his like of M. Night Shyamalan movies, several which are situated in Philadelphia. Working with a scouting agent that assisted on the Philadelphia film, Cage and his team visited the city, taking {{in many of the}} poorer neighborhoods and meeting with the residents there to capture the despair, poverty, and fear they saw. Cage has also stated that [...] "I would like people to play it once…because that's life. Life you can only play once... I would like people to have this experience that way." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm fine with , but the right way to enjoy Heavy Rain is really to make one thing because it's going to be your story. It's going to be unique to you. It's really <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>you</b> decided to write... I think playing it several times is also a way to kill the magic of it." [...] In the Director's Cut edition of the game (the PS Move compatible edition) within the bonus content, [...] "The Origami's Trail", the narrator states that the game is in fact set in Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|Composer Hans Zimmer, {{who scored}} Nolan's Batman film trilogy and Inception, also scored Interstellar. Zimmer and Nolan strived {{to develop a}} unique sound for Interstellar. Zimmer said: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are {{probably}} in the bin." [...] Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer [...] "one page of text" [...] that [...] "had {{more to do with}} [...] story than the plot of the movie". Nolan has stated that he said to Zimmer: [...] "I am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It's going to tell you the fable at the center of <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>You</b> work for one day, then play me what you have written", and that he embraced what Zimmer composed. Zimmer conducted [...] sessions for Interstellar, which was three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{features}} multiple post-credit scenes. The first {{gives the}} Vulture {{a chance at}} redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this [...] "was a really interesting thing {{in the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>You</b> couldn’t just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family." [...] The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a joke {{at the expense of the}} audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene. This was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the film. Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, [...] "You assume you’ll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn’t really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to." [...] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school, and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.|$|E
