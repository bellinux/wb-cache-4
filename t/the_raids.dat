5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out <b>the</b> <b>raids,</b> {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E

Tung had led <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 in which hundreds were killed and widespread physical destruction occurred. The Special Forces were used mainly for repressing dissidents rather than fighting communists.|$|E
5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, Fusil left <b>the</b> <b>Raid</b> {{to begin}} a new {{adventure}} race series, the Elf Authentic Adventure. Patrick Brignoli and Alain Gaimard continued to organize <b>the</b> <b>Raid</b> with their company RGO and Saga d'Aventures (<b>The</b> 1997 <b>Raid</b> in Ecuador was <b>the</b> first <b>raid</b> organized without Fusil). 2003 was {{the last year for}} <b>the</b> <b>Raid</b> Gauloises.

25|$|During Queen Anne's War, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> French <b>Raid</b> on Deerfield, New Englander Major Benjamin Church <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Acadian village of Castine before gathering at Mount Desert Island with other ships to continue with <b>the</b> <b>Raid</b> on St. Stephen, Raid on Grand Pré, <b>the</b> <b>Raid</b> on Piziquid, and <b>the</b> <b>Raid</b> on Chignecto.|$|R
5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of <b>the</b> <b>raids.</b> The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu {{was responsible for the}} attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following <b>the</b> <b>raids,</b> they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and blame the deaths on the communists.|$|E
5|$|The day {{had been}} bad for the Luftwaffe. Losses {{amounted}} to 18 Ju 52s; four belonged to III./KG.z.b.V 1. Raids by RAF Vickers Wellington bombers continued during the night. Ju 88 night fighters from NJG 2 downed two Wellingtons. The results of <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> are not known.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the rescue}} was {{released}} to the public on February 2. The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them {{of the rescue}}. News of <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages. The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> <b>The</b> enthusiasm over <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <b>The</b> <b>raid</b> was soon followed by additional successful <b>raids,</b> such as <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> of Bilibid Prison on February4, and <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> at Los Baños on February23.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>raids</b> {{ended in}} mid-1944 on {{the orders of}} Major-General Robert Laycock, the chief of Combined Operations Headquarters. He {{suggested}} that {{they were no longer}} as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, which could be detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>raids</b> {{had mixed}} results. While {{significant}} damage was inflicted on Singapore's important naval base and commercial port, some raids on these targets were not successful and other attacks on oil storage facilities on islands near Singapore were ineffective. The minelaying campaign disrupted Japanese shipping in the Singapore area {{and resulted in}} the loss of three vessels and damage to a further ten, but was not decisive. The Allied air attacks were successful in raising the morale of Singapore's civilian population, who believed that <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> marked the impending liberation of the city. The overall number of civilian casualties from the bombings was low, though civilian workers were killed during attacks on military facilities; one attack rendered hundreds of people homeless.|$|E
5|$|With the {{approval}} of Diệm, Nhu used the declaration of martial law to order armed men into the Buddhist pagodas. Nhu chose {{a time when he}} knew the American Embassy was leaderless. Frederick Nolting had returned to the United States and his successor Lodge was yet to arrive. As the high command of the ARVN worked closely with American military advisers deployed in the country, Nhu used the combat police and Tung's Special Forces, who took their orders directly from him. The men were dressed in standard army uniforms, such as paratroop attire, to frame the regulars for <b>the</b> <b>raids.</b> Nhu's motive was to avoid responsibility for a violent operation— which would anger the Vietnamese public and the American leadership. In falsely implicating the army in the attacks, Nhu intended to dent the confidence of the Vietnamese populace and the Americans in the senior officers who were plotting against him. Nhu evidently hoped the Buddhist majority and the Americans would blame the army for <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> and become less inclined to support a coup by the generals. In the past, Nhu's tactics in playing the generals against one another had kept conspirators off-balance and thwarted coup attempts. <b>The</b> <b>raids</b> were not unexpected, as the Buddhists had prepared themselves for the attacks, as had journalists, who were watching military installations for signs of movement.|$|E
2500|$|The 2001 film Pearl Harbor (with Alec Baldwin playing Doolittle) {{presented}} a heavily fictionalized version of <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> <b>The</b> film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier [...] in Corpus Christi, Texas, {{to stand in}} for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from the , standing in for the [...] from which <b>the</b> Doolittle <b>Raid</b> was launched. <b>The</b> film's portrayal of the planning of <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> <b>the</b> air <b>raid</b> itself, and <b>the</b> <b>raid's</b> aftermath, is not historically accurate.|$|R

50|$|On 29 January 2017, al-Raymi was the {{supposed}} {{target of a}} military action undertaken by the United States known as <b>the</b> Yakla <b>raid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>raid</b> resulted in <b>the</b> death of a Navy SEAL and {{of a number of}} civilians including a U.S. citizen. Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> on 5 February 2017, al-Raymi released an audiotape onto the internet referencing <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> <b>The</b> fact that al-Raymi had been a main target of <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> had not been previously confirmed.

5|$|Alarmed by <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.|$|E
5|$|Commando raids {{were made}} by the Western Allies during much of the Second World War against the Atlantic Wall. <b>The</b> <b>raids</b> were {{conducted}} by the armed forces of Britain, the Commonwealth and a small number of men from the occupied territories serving with No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando during the Second World War. All the operations took place between the Arctic Circle in Norway to the French border with Spain, along what was known as the Atlantic Wall.|$|E
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. <b>The</b> <b>raids</b> happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Raid</b> at Cabanatuan, {{carried out}} by a {{combined}} team of Alamo Scouts, Rangers and Filipino guerrillas, has been depicted in feature films. Edward Dmytryk's 1945 film Back to Bataan opens by retelling the story of <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> on <b>the</b> Cabanatuan POW camp, including real life film of the POW survivors. The 2005 John Dahl film <b>The</b> Great <b>Raid,</b> based on <b>the</b> books <b>The</b> Great <b>Raid</b> on Cabanatuan and Ghost Soldiers, focused on <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b>|$|R

5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1851, a French {{cargo ship}} {{carrying}} 98 tons of goods from Gibraltar to Rabat capsized near {{the coast of}} Salé. A few tons of goods were rescued, and were stored {{in the city for}} safekeeping. Salé turned out to be less than safe, however; by the next day, hundreds of townspeople were scavenging and stealing the goods. The thieves were thwarted by , but only temporarily. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>raids,</b> the French had lost 11,391 franc germinals worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|On {{the nights}} of 13 and 14 March 1941, the Clydebank Blitz {{virtually}} destroyed the town. 528 civilians were killed, over 617 people were seriously injured, and 48,000 civilians lost their homes. Only seven properties in Clydebank were undamaged, {{in one of}} the worst bombing raids in Britain. <b>The</b> <b>raids,</b> involving 260 Luftwaffe bombers on the first night and 200 on the second, targeted the industry of Clydeside, but the Titan crane was undamaged.|$|E
50|$|Several {{commentators}} compared <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> with <b>the</b> Short Creek <b>raid</b> of 1953, {{which was}} also a government raid on an FLDS community, and {{which led to a}} popular backlash against <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ten {{truckloads of}} bridge {{defenders}} {{were taken to}} jail and an estimated 500people were arrested in the city. Seventeen of the 47 professors at Huế University, who had resigned {{earlier in the week}} in protest against the dismissal of the rector Cao Văn Luân, a Catholic priest and opponent of Archbishop Thục (elder brother of Diệm and Nhu) were also arrested. <b>The</b> <b>raids</b> were repeated in cities and towns across the country. The total number of dead and disappeared was never confirmed, but estimates range up to several hundred. At least 1,400 were arrested.|$|E
5|$|The 57 raids {{were all}} between 1940 and 1944 and were mostly against targets in France, which had 36 raids. There were 12 raids in Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands and one each in Belgium and the Netherlands. <b>The</b> <b>raids</b> {{met with a}} mixture of fortunes. Operation Chariot—the raid against dock {{installations}} at Saint-Nazaire—has since been called the greatest raid of all. Others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all the commandos involved.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the results of the March firebombing attacks as <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E

5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> {{moves from}} a high profile raid with lots of loot (e.g. Plane of Time in EverQuest) to a raid with less loot (e.g. keying new members), then people who stay for <b>the</b> lesser <b>raid</b> are rewarded with points from <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> with more loot. I.e. someone who leaves when <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> is {{finished}} in Plane of Time, after lets say half <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> time, will only receive half of the DKP that someone who stayed and keyed new members will receive. Hence encouraging people to stay for raids when some people would otherwise log off.|$|R
