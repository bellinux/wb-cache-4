5|$|A dropship {{delivers}} the {{expedition to the}} surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt, the sole survivor, who used the extensive ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>location,</b> descending into corridors covered in alien secretions.|$|E

5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated.

In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E

Ireland, which {{for many years}} had not {{exploited}} the tourist potential of its castle heritage, began to encourage more tourists in the 1960s and 1970s and Irish castles are now a core part of the Irish tourist industry.

The infirmary hall of St Mary Magdalene at Glastonbury also follows this structure.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drain Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> of the present Grand Sluice. The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot Drain. The scheme was not entirely successful.|$|E

Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2008, Aliferi {{returned}} {{yet again}} to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction {{to begin with a}} condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi would also have to return for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>location,</b> which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.|$|E

5|$|Operation Copperhead {{was a small}} {{military}} deception operation run by the British {{during the}} Second World War.

The operation was conceived by Dudley Clarke in early 1944 after he watched the film Five Graves to Cairo. Following the war M. E. Clifton James {{wrote a book about}} the operation, I Was Monty's Double. It was later adapted into a film, with James in the lead role.|$|E

5|$|Pipeline {{construction}} {{ended in}} 1977, beginning a gradual decline in Fairbanks' economy. The loss of construction spending was mostly offset by state spending. Taxes on oil {{flowing through the}} pipeline were spent on low-interest loans, grants, and business assistance that poured money into the city. To entice businesses to return to downtown Fairbanks, the city demolished many of the bars favored by pipeline workers and attempted to attract a hotel or major business <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>location.</b> This effort was unsuccessful, and the land remained vacant until the late 1990s. Redevelopment of the Fairbanks airport was more successful. A new terminal built in 1984 functioned until 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo-reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. To avoid alerting the Germans as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> of the invasion, this work had to be undertaken over the entire European coastline. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings.|$|E
