25|$|The first {{dedicated}} war galleys {{fitted with}} rams were built with a {{mortise and tenon}} technique, a so-called shell-first method. In this, the planking of the hull {{was strong enough to}} hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for caulking. Hulls had sharp bottoms without keelsons in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with dowels with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from hogging there was a hypozoma, a thick cable that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known. The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could <b>twist</b> <b>off</b> if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400kg up to 2 tonnes.|$|E

2500|$|The hunting methods {{utilized}} by saltwater crocodiles are indistinct {{from any other}} crocodilian, with the hunting crocodile submerging and quietly swimming over to the prey before pouncing upwards striking suddenly. Unlike some other crocodilians, such as alligators and even Nile crocodiles, they are not known to have hunted on dry land. Young saltwater crocodiles are capable of breaching their entire body into the air in a single upward motion while hunting prey that may be perched on low hanging branches. While hunting rhesus macaques, crocodiles have been seen to knock the monkeys off a bank by knocking them with their tail, forcing the macaque into water for easy consumption. However, whether tail use in hunting is intentional or just an accidental benefit is not definitely clear. As with other crocodilians, their sharp, peg-like teeth are well-suited to seize and tightly grip prey, but not designed to shear flesh. Small prey are simply swallowed whole, while larger animals are forcibly dragged into deep water and drowned or crushed. Large prey is then torn into manageable pieces by [...] "death rolling" [...] (the spinning of the crocodile to <b>twist</b> <b>off</b> hunks of meat) or by sudden jerks of the head. Occasionally, food items will be stored for later consumption once a crocodile eats its fill, although {{this can lead to}} scavenging by interlopers such as monitor lizards.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{major cause}} {{is known as}} a [...] "twist off". <b>Twisting</b> <b>off</b> is when the drill string parts by failing catastrophically under the {{torsional}} stress.

50|$|In October, {{just after}} turning 19, Mustafina competed at the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antwerp. Prior to the competition, {{she had been}} sick for weeks and had been {{experiencing}} knee pain. In qualifications, she fell on her first tumbling pass on floor (two whips into a double Arabian) and crashed her second vault (round-off, half-on, full <b>twist</b> <b>off),</b> causing her to miss the finals in both events. However, she still qualified fifth for the all-around final with a score of 57.165, fifth for uneven bars, and eighth for balance beam. In the all-around final, she finished third {{with a total of}} 58.856 (14.891 on vault, 15.233 on uneven bars, 14.166 on balance beam, and 14.566 on floor), behind Simone Biles and Kyla Ross of the United States, but well ahead of the fourth-place finisher, Larisa Iordache of Romania. In the uneven bars final, she scored 15.033 and finished in third place, behind Huang Huidan and Ross. She also successfully debuted a new low to high bar transition: a full-twisting Maloney (or Seitz) caught in a mixed grip. She went on to win her first world beam title with a score of 14.900, ahead of Ross and Biles. This made her the first gymnast since Svetlana Khorkina to win a world medal on every event.|$|E
