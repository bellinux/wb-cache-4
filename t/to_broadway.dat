5|$|A large {{section of}} the neighborhood, from around Kentucky Street <b>to</b> <b>Broadway,</b> was razed. Many {{buildings}} south of Lee Street, and nearly all south of Avery Street (renamed Cardinal Boulevard) were razed {{for the construction of}} Noe Middle School, expansions to Manual High School and a major expansion of the University of Louisville, as well as to expand local industry east of Floyd Street.

5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} {{that focused on the}} possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido.

Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it {{presented}} casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return <b>to</b> <b>Broadway</b> until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.|$|E
5|$|An American Idiot stage musical {{adaptation}} premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2009. The musical was {{a collaboration}} between Green Day and director Michael Mayer.

Armstrong appeared in the Broadway production as St. Jimmy multiple times. With his return in 2011, the show grossed over $1million.|$|E
5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, they agreed to work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved <b>to</b> <b>Broadway.</b>|$|E
50|$|John Vickery was {{the first}} actor <b>to</b> move from <b>Broadway</b> into a {{different}} production of the show, when he chose <b>to</b> leave <b>Broadway</b> in 1999 <b>to</b> move to the Los Angeles production in 2000.|$|R

Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner John Kerr (no relation) in Vincente Minnelli's film adaptation of the drama. In 1955, Kerr won the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway début in 1953, she toured the United States with Tea and Sympathy. In 1975, she returned <b>to</b> <b>Broadway,</b> creating the role of Nancy in Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Seascape.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Hepburn {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Broadway</b> {{to appear}} in another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM was eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper of the Flame (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message {{on the dangers of}} fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement. It received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy–Hepburn pairing.|$|E
5|$|No {{national}} tour was attempted, {{but the show}} did have a six-week run at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago in spring 1954. Among those who played in the chorus during the New York run was future star Shirley MacLaine; Shirley Jones was a chorus girl in the Chicago performances. Subsequent productions include one by Kansas City's Starlight Theatre in 1955.

When Randy later learns that a boy {{has taken his}} teenage daughter <b>to</b> a <b>Broadway</b> show, Randy sneaks into the theater in a Spider-Man costume, and swings onstage, crashing into many actors and audience members, and damaging a water main. Randy's attempt was <b>to</b> stop <b>Broadway</b> shows and he figured he needed {{to find a way}} to destroy them.|$|R
