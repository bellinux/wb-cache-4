In 2008, the concept was adopted by Vital Signs member Rohail Hyatt, who planned to launch a Pakistani version of the show. The inaugural season premiered in June {{in front of a}} live audience. The show was produced by him, along with his wife Umber Hyatt and band members Shahzad Hasan & Rizwan-ul-Haq. It was an immediate success, receiving critical acclaim and frequently being rebroadcast on numerous television and radio stations in the country. In season 2, live audiences were excluded and performances were held in a closed studio platform, a format which continues to this day. Hyatt remained as executive producers {{for the show}} until season 6, stepping aside in 2013 after five years. They were replaced by Strings members Bilal Maqsood and Faisal Kapadia until on 29 October 2017, Strings announced Season 10 would be <b>there</b> <b>last</b> production.|$|E

When we were down <b>there</b> <b>last</b> time he says to me, 'I didn't tell you when you bought it off me, but that guitar used to be haunted'. I say, 'What are you talking about, Sherman?'. He says, 'There’s 50 solid {{citizens}} here in Como who'll tell you this guitar is haunted. It's the darnedest thing – we’d leave it over in the potato barn and we'd come back in and it would be moved. You'd put it down somewhere and the next morning you’d come back and it would have moved. When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not very long ago and I said to him, 'Sherman! Why didn't you tell me this before?' and he said, 'Well the ghost was gone – I didn't want it around here no more!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|As for the Portuguese defense, Coen {{had this}} to say: [...] "The Portuguese beat us off from Macau with their slaves; it was not done with any soldiers, for there are none in Macau. [...] See how the enemy thus holds his {{possessions}} so cheaply whilst we squander ourselves". He also said [...] "The slaves of the Portuguese at Macau served them so well and faithfully, that it was they who defeated and drove away our people <b>there</b> <b>last</b> year", and [...] "Our people saw very few Portuguese" [...] during the battle. Coen would from there on advocate for the employment of slaves for warfare in preference to Dutch soldiers. While the Portuguese didn't give the blacks sole credit for the victory, they nonetheless appreciated the bravery shown by the slaves so much that many slaves were freed on the battlefield immediately after the victory. When minor Chinese officials took {{the heads of the}} slain Dutchmen to Canton as proof of Portuguese service in defending Chinese territory, they apparently relayed stories of the blacks' bravery as well, causing the impressed Provincial Admiral (海道副使; referred in European sources as haitao) to send a gift of 200 piculs of rice to be distributed among them.|$|E
