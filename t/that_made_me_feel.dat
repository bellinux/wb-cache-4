It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I {{come up with this}} concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up {{it never occurred to me}} that it wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E
500|$|Contemporaries of Edwards {{have been}} unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, {{it would have been}} Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there {{is no doubt in my}} mind that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E

I’ve had lots of issues with body image and weight my whole life and it really took {{a great deal of}} work to {{recognize}} that at all those weights, no matter how I felt, I could still find a dress <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> sexy and powerful." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{looked at}} her gravely. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "She hadn't even found that {{something}} yet, {{and she was very}} kind. <b>That's</b> what <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> it worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} one I've got," [...] he said to Kinnaird. [...] "Anyway, I guess the thing will dry, and I've had a sail <b>that</b> has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> young again." ...|$|R
6000|$|To Clemantiny {{she added}} in a low, gentle tone, [...] "There's a {{look on his face}} that {{reminded}} me of Johnny. It came out so strong when he sat up just now <b>that</b> it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like crying. Don't you notice it, Clemantiny?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Dear Captain Pratt: What shall I do? I {{have been}} here two weeks and I have not bathe. These folks have no bath place. Your school daughter, MAGGIE STANDS LOOKING" [...] Pratt advised her to do {{as he had done}} on the frontier... filling a wash basin with water and [...] "rubbing myself well, have had a bath <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> as good as jumping into a river." [...] He signed his letter - [...] "Your friend and school father," [...] R.H. Pratt.|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking, a {{daughter}} of Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse, {{was among the first}} wave of children brought from Rosebud and one of Captain Pratt's model students. Maggie had difficulty adjusting to the demands of her new lifestyle at Carlisle, and once slapped Miss Hyde, the matron, when Hyde insisted that Maggie make her bed every day and keep her room clean. Instead of retaliating, Miss Hyde stood her ground and Maggie acquiesced. Like most of the Carlisle students, Maggie was enrolled in the Summer Outing Program. After her arrival to her country home, Maggie wrote a letter to Pratt. [...] "Dear Captain Pratt: What shall I do? I have been here two weeks and I have not bathed. These folks have no bath place. Your school daughter, Maggie Stands Looking." [...] Pratt advised her to do as he had done on the frontier and signed his letter [...] "Your friend and school father. R.H. Pratt." [...] Maggie replied, [...] "After filling a wash basin with water and rubbing myself well, have had a bath <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> as good as jumping into a river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I know," [...] {{returned}} Fan, still troubled in {{her mind}} and anxious. [...] "It was <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so happy. I thought--that {{you wanted me to}} love you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{much better}} {{as it is}} to have found one's anchor than to be tossed at the will of the waves. That was a frightful time. Thank heaven <b>that</b> you <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> for the cable! There is a dreary voyage to come, but after all, every day we end the Creed with [...] "The life everlasting."' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{assured him}} jocularly, as I took my {{place at the}} table, <b>that</b> he <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> as if I were a pretty girl, and that he mustn't be {{surprised}} if I blushed. But he was busy arranging his floral tribute at the sideboard. [...] "Stand it before the Captain's plate, steward, please." [...] He made this request in his usual undertone.|$|R
6000|$|... “Such {{a charming}} {{lady in a}} grey silk dress and a hand as white as snow. She looked at me through such funny glasses {{on the end of}} a long handle. A very great lady but her voice was as kind as the voice of a saint. I have never seen {{anything}} like <b>that.</b> She <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so timid.” ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> pretty bad. About {{an hour or}} two ago {{it would}} a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you stop}} here, Baases, while I go to look. If you hear {{anything}} happen to me, {{you will have}} time to run away," [...] words <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> somewhat ashamed of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{called out}} Rosamund, with a {{pleasure}} so positive that it rang {{out like a}} complaint. [...] "It's just like that horrid, beastly fizzy stuff they gave me <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> happy." ...|$|E
60|$|One reason I {{have not}} {{answered}} sooner is because your letter was so sweet and loving <b>that</b> it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> an ungrateful and unappreciative wretch. Another {{is that this}} life I now lead does not induce writing. I am outdoors all day, and when I get back to this cabin at night I am too tired for anything but bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is there a God {{to trust}} in?" [...] said George, {{in such a}} tone of bitter despair as arrested the old gentleman's words. [...] "O, I've seen things all my life <b>that</b> have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> there can't be a God. You Christians don't know how these things look to us. There's a God for you, but is there any for us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'When you see her,' he said, 'tell her I haven't {{forgotten}} her, {{and never}} shall. But {{she was quite}} right; {{this is the sort}} of lady that I'm fit for.' And the way he looked at <b>that</b> girl <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> quite uncomfortable. Then he gave me one of his little bows; and off they went, she as pleased as Punch. I really was sorry for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} you loved me then, Cuthbert. There were other things, you know, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> {{it could not be}} so, but then {{that for the first time}} I really knew----" [...] and she stopped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{the idea}} came to me that I might do a little scratching, and, turning around until my tail was pointed {{straight}} for the front door, I kept my hind feet at work till Foxy began to cough and choke at a rate <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> as if I were doing a pretty good job.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing much. The younger one--and I {{was half}} sorry I'd spoken {{straight}} to her--opened her eyes wide. The elder one {{she looks at}} me in a way <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> fit to choke her, while Haldane made a little bow. 'I have no doubt he is in capable hands, and we need not trouble you further. No, I don't think you need mention that we called,' says he." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oho!" [...] cried Lucilla, [...] "that's fine flattery, sir; but I am {{glad you}} said it, for <b>that</b> speech has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> {{more like a}} woman than I have felt since I first put on this sailor's toggery." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Stephen Jenkins and Kevin Cadogan. According to Jenkins, the song [...] "started from a riff that Kevin was playing on the guitar. The words were how <b>that</b> riff <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel.</b> The story is just lamenting {{the end of a}} {{relationship}} and all of its wasted time." [...] During a concert on December 9, 2000, Jenkins said that the song [...] "is about a rich girl from Bernal Heights." ...|$|R
30|$|Hannah: I {{would never}} have just worn a dress without a jacket before she came on to the scene. She always looks put-together, and I never thought that I could do <b>that.</b> She just <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> much more {{comfortable}} about it.|$|R
6000|$|It was the {{quietness}} itself <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> {{the necessity}} of an answer almost violently gay. [...] "Oh yes," [...] I laughed, [...] "you have a tremendous deal in common with Mrs. Meldrum! I've just returned to England after a long absence and I'm {{on my way to}} see her. Won't you come with me?" [...] It struck me that her old reason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{could hardly}} have been the words, for I didn't {{understand}} them--it must have been the tone he spoke in, I suppose, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> a momentary tremor. I was half inclined, without the ghost of a reason for it, to wish him good-night, and go in again. Not much like me, you will say. Not much, indeed! It didn't last a moment. Your darling Lydia soon came to her senses again.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{a natural}} {{question}} enough," [...] he admitted. [...] "Well, first, I only {{came across a}} letter Monty wrote with the address of those lawyers a few days ago, and, secondly, the Bekwando Mine and Land Company has only just boomed, and you see <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> that I'd like to give a lift up to any one belonging to poor old Monty I could find. I've a mind {{to go on with}} the thing myself and find out somehow who this young lady is!" ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} George [...] "Corpsegrinder" [...] Fisher, his vocal {{replacement}} for Cannibal Corpse, he said, [...] "I know George {{is a good}} singer, though he wouldn't have been my choice personally. I kind of like it though because he {{was never able to}} sing my songs better than me; <b>that's</b> always <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> proud, <b>that</b> I was able to write songs that couldn't be imitated. I think he does a great job though, and he's a real nice guy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ferreira {{stated that}} the lyrics for [...] "Red Lips" [...] were {{intended}} as a narrative of the emotional breakdown of [...] "a very specific person or a type <b>that</b> always <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable". In October 2012, DJ Com Truise released a synthpop remix of [...] "Red Lips", which a writer for Fact felt complimented the songs on his debut studio album Galactic Melt (2011). The DSL Remix of the original track {{is included in the}} soundtrack album of the feature film Vampire Academy: Blood Sisters (2014).|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite. Occasionally I {{meet the}} people afterwards. For instance, Thomas Sims, the cabman, {{was one of}} them, and," [...] he added colouring, [...] "forgive me for saying so, but you are another. I knew it at once, the moment I saw you, and <b>that</b> is what <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so friendly." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is amazing}} how {{many things in}} this part of the country we'd never have thought of if it hadn't been for Mr. Poplington. At dinner he told us about Exmoor and the Lorna Doone country, and the wild deer hunting that can be had nowhere else in England, and lots of other things <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> we must be up and doing if we wanted to see all we ought to see before we left Chedcombe. When I went upstairs I said to Jone that Mr. Poplington was a very {{different}} man from what I thought he was.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned my}} head to the {{hillside}} to listen also for the laggards; {{but there was no}} answer. Save for the cry of a low-flying loon and the snap of a twig--too sharp and heavy for little feet to make--the woods were all silent. As I turned to the log again, something warm and heavy rested against my side. Then I knew; and with the knowledge came a swift thrill of regret <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> guilty and out of place in the silent woods. The leader was calling, the silent flock were waiting for two of their number who would never answer the call again.|$|E
60|$|So {{the king}} sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, {{and before long}} the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about {{a half an hour}} they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. They both got {{powerful}} mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. <b>That</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.|$|E
60|$|My {{mother said}} nothing, but took {{me up in}} her arms, and carried me back to bed, and then, sitting down beside me, and holding my hand in hers--there was not so very much {{difference}} in the size--began to sing in that low, caressing voice of hers <b>that</b> always <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel,</b> for the time being, that I {{wanted to be a}} good boy, a song she often used to sing to me, and that I have never heard any one else sing since, and should not care to.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, old fellow," [...] he said, [...] "tell me {{some more}} about that girl, Walda Nagasta. What a sweet face she's got, and what pluck! Of course, such things ain't in my line, never looked at a woman these twenty years past, hard enough to {{remember}} her next morning, but, by Jingo! the eyes of <b>that</b> one <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> quite queer here," [...] and he hit the sleeping-suit somewhere in the middle, [...] "though perhaps it was only because {{she was such a}} contrast to the lions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Terence," [...] {{the colonel}} said, [...] "I didn't {{think the time}} was coming so soon when I {{was going to be}} {{instructed}} by your father's son, but I will own <b>that</b> you have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I have begun campaigning too late in life, and that you have given me a lesson." ...|$|R
