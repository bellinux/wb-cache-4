5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal, Dølahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter is {{alternately}} {{considered a}} subtype of <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal {{and a separate}} breed; it is also considered {{a part of the}} Coldblood trotter type. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse, known for its pulling power and agility, while <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter is a smaller, faster horse used for harness racing; the two types are commonly interbred. Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the studbook, which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley, and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse. Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred, Arabian and other blood added in, especially during the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter in the 19th century. The first studbook was created in 1941, and the current breed association formed in 1947. Although originally used mainly as a pack horse, today the heavier Dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the Norwegian or Dole Trotter studbook {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of the same standards. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the Gudbrandsdal, an inland valley in the county of Oppland. It is likely that <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> is in part a descendant of the Friesian, as the two breeds are similar in conformation, and the Frisian people were known traders in the area between 400 and 800 AD. There was also equine movement between western Norway and northern England during the 9th century through the mid-11th century; this extended period of trade between these areas likely influenced the strong resemblance between <b>the</b> <b>Dole,</b> Friesian, Fell Pony and Dale Pony breeds.|$|E

5|$|Maintaining an {{affordable}} food {{supply to the}} city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (annona) to citizens who registered for it. About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received <b>the</b> <b>dole,</b> amounting to about 33kg. per month, for a per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. <b>The</b> <b>dole</b> cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E
5|$|Urban {{populations and}} the {{military}} preferred to consume their grain {{in the form of}} bread. Mills and commercial ovens were usually combined in a bakery complex. By the reign of Aurelian, the state had begun to distribute the annona as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories, and added olive oil, wine, and pork to <b>the</b> <b>dole.</b>|$|E
5|$|Interest in <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal {{continued}} through World War II, {{and the horses}} were used heavily during Norway's occupation by Germany. Breed numbers and interest diminished after the war as increasing mechanization reduced demand for draft animals; however, a breeding center was established in 1962 to help maintain population numbers. In 1947, the National Dølehorse Association was formed to promote and preserve the breed. As of 2002, there are approximately 4,000 registered Dole Gudbrandsdals, with around 175 new foals registered annually.|$|E

5000|$|The leftmost element, #84, is a brick {{structure}} {{built in}} 1834 by Albert and Edmond Dole that was originally three stories in height. It shares unified cornices {{at the fourth}} and fifth level with the adjacent wood frame block (#88), also built (in 1843) by <b>the</b> <b>Doles.</b> These building were used by <b>the</b> <b>Doles,</b> who were cabinetmakers, as a furniture factory until 1889. Chandler & Co., the next occupant, adapted the space for use as a retail furniture showroom, using some of the space for upholstery work and as a repair shop. During their ownership, #84 and #88 were both raised to five stories, and #96 was integrated into its facility, with the intervening courtyard space service as a shipping and loading area. It was home to the Bangor Furniture Company 1927-1989. [...] It has since been converted into mixed retail/commercial/residential use.|$|R
5|$|The {{tradition}} of <b>the</b> <b>dole</b> continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread {{are given to}} local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Harold Brighouse's play Hobson's Choice {{takes place}} in the Salford of 1880, and the 1954 film version was shot in the town. Walter Greenwood's 1933 novel Love on <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> was set in a fictional area known as Hanky Park, said in the novel to be near Salford, but in reality based on Salford itself. A more modern fictional setting {{influenced}} by the area is Coronation Streets Weatherfield. The Salford of the 1970s was the setting for the BAFTA award winning East is East. Salford was featured in the second series of the Channel 4 programme The Secret Millionaire, screened in 2007. Salford is also home to the theatre venue Studio Salford.|$|E
5|$|Two stallions, named Odin and Mazarin, {{had a large}} {{influence}} {{on the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> breed. Odin (son of Partisan), was a stallion of Thoroughbred (some sources say Norfolk Trotter) breeding, imported to Norway in 1834. Odin was said to cost ₤257 at the time and to have been bred to over 100 mares in his first four years in Norway. All Dole Trotter horses today contain Odin bloodlines. Mazarin was an Arabian imported to Norway in 1934. In 1849, another influential stallion was foaled, named Veikle Balder 4; he was a grandson of Odin and is considered the foundation stallion of the heavier Dole type. A stallion named Brimen 825 was used by breeders to maintain and improve some horses of the heavier Dole type for draft uses.|$|E

5|$|People from Salford {{are called}} Salfordians, {{and the city}} has been the birthplace and home to notable people of {{national}} and international acclaim. Amongst the most notable persons of historic significance with a connection to Salford are Emmeline Pankhurst, {{one of the founders of}} the British suffragette movement, who lived in Salford, and the scientist James Prescott Joule, who was born and raised in Salford. The novelist Walter Greenwood (Love on <b>the</b> <b>Dole)</b> and the dramatist Shelagh Delaney (A Taste of Honey) were both born in, and wrote about, Salford. Musicians Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook, who were members of Joy Division– which later reformed as New Order– are both from Salford. Notable Salfordian sportspeople include former England football international and Manchester United F.C. midfielder Paul Scholes, Olympic Javelin Thrower Shelley Holroyd, English former snooker player Mick Price was born in the area and Great Britain and England rugby league international and current Warrington Wolves front-rower Adrian Morley. Salford was also the former hometown of The Smiths frontman, singer-songwriter Morrissey and the band Happy Mondays.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii {{was still in}} an economic recession. A number {{of members of the}} business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of mandamus against the government giving <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Earth's <b>Dole</b> effect {{describes}} <b>the</b> isotopic [superscript 18]O/[superscript 16]O-enrichment {{of atmospheric}} oxygen {{with respect to}} ocean water, amounting under today's conditions to 23. 5 ‰. We have developed a model of <b>the</b> Earth's <b>Dole</b> effect by combining the results of three-dimensional models of the oceanic and terrestrial carbon and oxygen cycles with results of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) with built-in water isotope diagnostics. We obtain a range from 22. 4 ‰ to 23. 3 ‰ for the isotopic enrichment of atmospheric oxygen. We estimate a stronger contribution to <b>the</b> global <b>Dole</b> effect by <b>the</b> terrestrial relative to the marine biosphere in contrast to previous studies. This is primarily caused by a modeled high leaf water enrichment of 5 – 6 ‰. Leaf water enrichment rises by ∼ 1 ‰ to 6 – 7 ‰ when we use it to fit the observed 23. 5 ‰ of <b>the</b> global <b>Dole</b> effect. <b>The</b> present model {{is designed to be}} utilized in forthcoming paleo studies allowing a quantitative analysis of long-term observations from polar ice cores.
