50|$|Nuel D. Belnap, Jr. (born 1930) is an American logician and philosopher who {{has made}} {{contributions}} to the philosophy of logic, temporal logic, and structural proof theory. He taught at the University of Pittsburgh since 1963 {{until his retirement in}} 2011; before that he was at Yale University. His best-known work is his collaboration with Alan Ross Anderson on relevance logic. He has also published books on the logic of questions and answers, with <b>Thomas</b> <b>Steel,</b> and the logic of agency, with Michael Perloff and Ming Xu. He has contributed to the foundations of two very distinct theories of truth: he was a co-author of The Prosentential Theory of Truth with Dorothy Grover and Joseph Camp, and of The Revision Theory of Truth with Anil Gupta. He is also co-author with Ming Xu and Michel Perloff of Facing the Future. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008.|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} a double objective: to provide foreign colleagues with {{an insight into}} the {{controversy}} surrounding the international competitiveness of pig iron produced in Bilbao and also to present previously unpublished documentation regarding the European iron industry, which I have retrieved from the historical archive of Credit Lyonnais of Paris. This information includes the costs of Biscayan, French, British, German and Belgium pig iron broken down into five components (iron ore, coke, flux, labour and other costs), which is useful in determining {{the reasons why the}} pig iron from Bilbao became less competitive. The article is made up of three parts. Firstly, I will synthesise the controversy surrounding the competitiveness of the Basque iron and steel industry. Then I will present the itemised costs which provide information to illustrate how Biscayan pig iron was not competitive because it was produced with English coal which was more expensive than that consumed by the European factories located "on top of" or near coal seams. The article will finish with a section that, by way of conclusion, explains the comparative advantage and disadvantage of Bilbao, applying the first model of Alfred Weber's Theory of Industrial Location to three technological advances, occurring between the 1860 s and 1913 (malleable iron, Bessemer steel and <b>Thomas</b> <b>steel)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{introduction}} to the Outstanding contributions to logic volume devoted to Nuel Belnap’s work on indeterminism and free action, we provide {{a brief overview of}} some of the formal frameworks and methods involved in Belnap’s work on these topics: theories of branching histories, specifically “branching time” and “branching space-times”, the stit (“seeing to it that”) logic of agency, and case-intensional first order logic. We also draw some connections to the contributions included in this volume. Abstracts of these contributions are included as an appendix. Nuel Belnap’s work in logic and in philosophy spans a period of over half a century. During this time, he has followed a number of different research lines, most of them over a period of many years or decades, and often in close collaboration with other researchers: 1 relevance logic, a long term project starting from a collaboration with Alan Anderson dating back to the late 1950 s and continued with Robert Meyer and Michael Dunn into the 1990 s; the logic of questions, developed with <b>Thomas</b> <b>Steel</b> in the 1960 s and 1970 s; display logic in the 1980 s and 1990 s; the revision theory of truth, with Anil Gupta, in the 1990 s; and a long-term, continuing interest in indeterminism and free action. This book is devoted to Belnap’s work on the latter two topics. In this introduction, we provide a brief overview of some of the formal frameworks and methods involved in thatwork, and we drawsome connections to the contributions included in this volume. Abstracts of these contributions are presented in Appendix A...|$|E

By 1834, however, he had written to his sisters from Sydney but, before G. W. Walker was able to trace him there, his uncle Isaac Stickney received news of his nephew's death by drowning in November 1834 {{at the mouth of the}} Manning River N. S. W., from Thomas Soltit who kept the "Jolly Tar" public house where Stickney lodged in Sydney. Isaac Stickney wrote to Governor Burke of New South Wales enclosing Soltit's letter and asking for further information. This, together with information and papers from the Port Master, was given to Backhouse and Walker, who discovered that Richard had used an assumed name "Robert Smith" and had been employed by <b>Thomas</b> <b>Steel</b> as one of the seamen sailing up the East Coast for cedar on a small coasting craft which sank near the mouth of the Manning River, and that Steel had Stickney'S watch, gun and some old books (nautical works and 3 or 4 religious Friends' works). Stickney's own letter to his sister Sarah in 1834, with these papers, expressed regret at the grief he had caused his family and described his impressions of Sydney. He found that "the country born inhabitants are now becoming numerous and will soon form a sufficiently distinct people, they are a facsimile of the Americans both in body and mind, tall rawboned and muscular, with a most exalted opinion of themselves indeed in most athletic exercises as cricket, rowing or boxing they bear away more than their share of prizes. They are mostly ignorant to the last degree. " The "currency lasses" he thought "not very elegant" but "there is one accomplishment not generally reckoned in the female list in which they excell they can most of them. swim. " He remarked too that 99 percent of the children had fair hair. Richard Stickney attended the Friends (Quaker) Meeting House in Sydney when he had time.
