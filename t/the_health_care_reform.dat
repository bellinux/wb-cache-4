25|$|Kohl's time as Chancellor {{also saw}} some {{controversial}} {{decisions in the}} field of social policy. Student aid was made reimbursable to the state while <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 1989 introduced the concept by which patients pay up front and are reimbursed, while increasing patient co-payments for hospitalisation, spa visits, dental prostheses, and prescription drugs. In addition, while a 1986 Baby-Year Pensions reform granted women born after 1921 one year of work-credit per child, lawmakers were forced by public protest to phase in supplementary pension benefits for mothers who were born before the cut-off year.|$|E
25|$|Enrollment in the full-price Commonwealth Choice Plans, {{offered through}} the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector, fluctuates between 15,000-20,000 {{according}} to the state. According to the DHCFP's quarterly Key Indicator reports, 89,000 people bought healthcare insurance directly as of June 2009, up from 40,000 in June 2006.

40|$|Discussions of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> {{are always}} tightly {{connected}} {{with the question of}} ensuring equity in financing <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> This paper analyses <b>the</b> German <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> 2007 and its effect on <b>the</b> equity of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing. To do this Rawls' and Nozick's perceptions of justice will be applied to develop benchmarks to classify new financing options introduced with the reform. These benchmarks are indicated through a differentiation between the two principles „fair compensation for performance“ and „equitable support based on need“ and the extent of income redistribution of the new financing modes. Overall, it can be concluded that <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reforms</b> have not reduced equity in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> financing neither if Rawls perception of justice is applied nor if the conception of justice held by Nozick is applied.

2500|$|Stuart Rothenberg of the non-partisan Rothenberg {{political}} report, however, {{has stated}} that even though Democrats were able to win a competitive race {{to hold on to}} Murtha's former seat, [...] "But the road doesn't necessarily get easier for Democrats. Critz was pro-life, pro-gun, and opposed <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> bill that many vulnerable Democratic incumbents supported." [...] Rothenberg still predicts that Republicans will make substantial gains, which suggests that this could be a pyrrhic victory for Democrats comparable to the Republican win in 2006 special House election in California's 50th congressional district in which the ruling party managed to hold onto a district in a special election, but still lost control of Congress months later.|$|E

2500|$|The AMA's vehement {{campaign}} against Medicare in the 1950s and 1960s included the Operation Coffee Cup supported by Ronald Reagan. Before Medicare passed, according to Steven Schroeder, Wilbur Cohen inserted [...] "usual, customary and reasonable" [...] charges into the Social Security Act of 1965 [...] "in an unsuccessful attempt to placate" [...] the AMA. Since {{the enactment of}} Medicare, the AMA stated that it [...] "continues to oppose attempts to cut Medicare funding or shift increased costs to beneficiaries {{at the expense of}} the quality or accessibility of care" [...] and [...] "strongly supports subsidization of prescription drugs for Medicare patients based on means testing". The AMA also campaigns to raise Medicare payments to physicians, arguing that increases will protect seniors' access to health care. In the 1990s, it was part of the coalition that defeated <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> proposed by President Bill Clinton.|$|E
2500|$|Buffett {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> under President Barack Obama as {{insufficient to}} deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP. (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.) Buffett said [...] "If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).|$|E
2500|$|The AMA {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{political}} lobbying budgets of any organization in the United States. Its political positions throughout its history have often been controversial. In the 1930s, the AMA attempted to prohibit its members from working for the health maintenance organizations established during the Great Depression, which violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and resulted in a conviction ultimately affirmed by the US Supreme Court. The American Medical Association's vehement campaign against Medicare in the 1950s and 1960s included the Operation Coffee Cup, supported by Ronald Reagan. Since the enactment of Medicare, the AMA reversed its position and now opposes any [...] "cut to Medicare funding or shift [...] increased costs to beneficiaries {{at the expense of the}} quality or accessibility of care". However, the AMA remains opposed to any single-payer health care plan that might enact a National Health Service-style organization in the United States, such as the United States National Health Care Act. In the 1990s, the organization was part of the coalition that defeated <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> advanced by Hillary and Bill Clinton.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{coverage}} of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. <b>The</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> debate in the United States has been influenced by the Tea Party protest phenomenon, with reporters and politicians spending time reacting to it. Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance PR executive Wendell Potter of the Center for Media and Democracy- whose funding comes from groups such as the Tides Foundation- argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate astroturfing, which he says that he used to write for CIGNA. Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity- whose funding comes mainly from the Koch Industries corporation- counter-argue that those corporations oppose a public-plan, but some try to push for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to buy health insurance for their employees. Journalist Ben Smith has referred to mid-2009 as [...] "The Summer of Astroturf" [...] given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides.|$|E
