5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> each pest and control agent.|$|E
40|$|Although some {{researchers}} have suggested that <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> cortisol and testosterone predicts ratings of men’s facial attractiveness, evidence for this pattern of results is equivocal.

5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Cm(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Cm3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 ms) and spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> particles.|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) has a common chaperone {{function in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. To characterise this function, we investigated <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> of purified PDI with radiolabelled model peptides, somatostatin and mastoparan, by cross-linking. <b>The</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> peptides and PDI was specific, for it showed saturation and was abolished by denaturation of PDI. <b>The</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> a hydrophobic peptide without cysteine residues was much more sensitive to Triton X- 100 than <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> PDI and a more hydrophilic peptide wither without cysteine residues. We therefore propose that hydrophobic <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> protein disulphide isomerase and peptides {{play an important role}} in the binding process. <b>The</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> PDI and <b>the</b> bound peptide therefore is enhanced by the formation of mixed disulphide bonds...|$|R

5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E

To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of four factors such as grain size, wheel speed, grinding depth and feed rate and the data obtained from <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> factors in orthogonal test, it is proved that grain size, playing a leading part, has the greatest effect on surface roughness. It is also found that <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> grain size and wheel speed has more effects than the single factor of wheel speed on the surface roughness, and meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> grain size and grinding depth has more effects than the single factor of grinding depth, and <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> grain size and workpiece speed has more effects than the single factor of workpiece speed.

5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) as a result of <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some {{role in the development of}} type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. <b>The</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood.
