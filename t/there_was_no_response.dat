5|$|The French assault {{began at}} the same time, but they were halted by the abatis, which was {{undamaged}} by the artillery fire. The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>response,</b> the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, driving them back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw down their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>response,</b> he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E

5|$|In Chittagong, about 115km (70mi) {{north of}} where Akash moved ashore, surface {{stations}} reported peak winds of 37km/h (23mph) and a pressure of 996.8vhPa. Near its landfall location, Akash produced high tides that flooded coastal areas {{with up to}} 1.5m (5ft) of water, destroying at least 30businesses. The cyclone destroyed 205houses and left an additional 845 damaged. Akash caused moderate crop damage near the coast, including 2ha (4.9acres) of destroyed lands of shrimp farms. Heavy precipitation was reported, with one station reporting a total of 53mm (2.12in); the rainfall caused flooding in inland areas. The heavy rains, caused by outer bands of the cyclone before it made landfall, limited play in Chittagong in the third One Day International cricket match between India and Bangladesh, before the match was abandoned. Strong winds caused power outages throughout Cox's Bazar District, and downed about 200 trees on St. Martin's Island. The cyclone left a total of 10boats unaccounted for, with about 50fishermen missing. In total, three fisherman were confirmed killed, all on St. Martin's Island, with two people left hospitalized. The passage of Cyclone Akash left many people homeless. Initially <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>response</b> from the government. In all, 14 people were killed by Akash and damages amounted to US$982million.|$|E

25|$|The need to {{work closely}} with the Iraqi {{government}} was not something many of shield volunteers felt comfortable with. Some felt that the list delivered by the officials compromised their autonomy. Others felt that they would rather be deployed in schools, hospitals, and orphanages. These shield volunteers left Iraq.

25|$|On August 18, 2006 Lebanese police sources {{reported}} that Israeli warplanes launched four missiles toward {{targets in the}} eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek. Israeli sources acknowledge that its air force performs sorties over Lebanese territory, but denied breaking the ceasefire. Lebanese officials later contradicted the police sources stating that no missiles were fired by the Israeli planes. The Associated Press {{reported that}} Hezbollah had fired at least 10 Katyusha rockets into southern Lebanon. The IDF stated that as none had crossed the border {{and there were no}} casualties, they did not respond. Earlier, skirmishes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah left six guerrillas dead.

25|$|The Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan begins {{previous}} to {{its independence}} {{when it was}} part of India. The roots of the Bahá'í Faith in the region go back to the first days of the Bábí religion in 1844, with Shaykh Sa'id Hindi who was from Multan. Meanwhile, a Muslim émigré from near Lahore, Fazel (Frank) Khan, moved to Australia where he was asked to present the teachings of Islam at a Bahá'í school and was so affected by the class that he and his family converted to the Bahá'í Faith in 1947. On two later occasions Fazel visited his home village and endeavoured to teach them his new religion. On the first visit <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>response,</b> but during the second visit a cousin converted in the town of Sialkot. On the other hand, a fatwa was issued in Sialkot against the Bahá'ís.|$|E

25|$|At {{the onset}} of Kali Yuga, once king Parikshit went hunting in the forest. Just then {{in the middle of}} the way, Kali, {{appeared}} before him and asked permission to enter his kingdom, which the king denied. Upon insisting, Parikshit allowed him five places to reside: where there is gambling, alcohol consumption, prostitution, animal slaughter and gold. Kali smartly entered into Parikshit's golden crown and spoiled his thoughts. Parikshit entered the hut of a sage named Shamika as he was thirsty. He found the sage in deep meditation. He bowed to him several times but as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>response.</b> In anger, he took a dead snake and threw it around the sage's neck. Later when the sage's son, Shringin, heard of this incident he cursed the king to die of snake bite on the seventh day. On hearing this, the king forswore the throne for his son Janamejaya and spent his last seven days listening to the discourses of sage Shuka, compiled as the Bhagavata Purana under the banyan tree of Shukratal. As prophesied, the snake king Takshaka bit Parikshita, who left his mortal remains behind and attained Moksha.|$|E
25|$|Like his father, al-Wathiq was {{an ardent}} Mu'tazilite, but also {{maintained}} {{good relations with}} the Alids. In 846, a well-respected notable, Ahmad ibn Nasr ibn Malik al-Khuza'i, a descendant of one of the original missionaries of the Abbasid Revolution, launched a plot in Baghdad to overthrow al-Wathiq, his Turkish commanders, and the Mu'tazilite doctrines. The uprising was scheduled for the night of 4 April 846. However, those who were supposed to sound a drum as the signal to rise did so a day early, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>response.</b> The Mus'abid deputy governor of the city, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim—the governor, his brother Ishaq, was absent—inquired on the event, and the conspiracy was revealed. Ahmad ibn Nasr and his followers were arrested and brought before al-Wathiq. The caliph interrogated him publicly, though more on the thorny issue of the createdness of the Quran rather than on the rebellion. Ahmad's answers enraged al-Wathiq so much, that the Caliph took al-Samsamah, a famous sword of the pre-Islamic period, and personally joined in the execution of Ahmad, along with the Turks Bugha al-Sharabi and Sima al-Dimashqi. Ahmad's corpse was publicly displayed at the gibbet of Babak in Baghad, while twenty of his followers were thrown into prison.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the English were {{adopting}} a different strategy. Rather {{than focusing on}} punitive expeditions favoured by his father, the young Henry of Monmouth adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit. In March, 1,000 men from all over Flintshire appeared before the Chief Justitiar of the county and agreed to pay a communal fine for their adherence to Glyndŵr. Gradually the same pattern was repeated throughout the country. In July the Earl of Arundel’s north-east Lordship around Oswestry and Clun submitted. One by one the Lordships began to surrender. By midsummer, Owain’s castle at Aberystwyth was under siege. That autumn Aberystwyth Castle surrendered. In 1409 it was the turn of Harlech Castle. Last minute desperate envoys {{were sent to the}} French for help. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>response.</b> Gruffydd Young was sent to Scotland to attempt to coordinate action but nothing was to come of that either. Harlech Castle fell in 1409. Edmund Mortimer died in the final battle and Owain’s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of his Mortimer granddaughters were taken prisoner and incarcerated in the Tower of London. They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.|$|E
