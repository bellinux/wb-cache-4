40|$|The {{specific}} {{rates of}} respiration of cells of wild type and four extrachromosomal mutants of Neurospora crassa were measured throughout the vegetative growth cycle. Two forms of respiration were observed: (i) cyanide sensitive; and (ii) cyanide resistant, salicyl hydroxamate sensitive. These two forms are called <b>terminal</b> and <b>alternate,</b> respectively. The former proceeds by the mitochondrial electron transfer chain and involves the cytochromes; the latter apparently proceeds by the initial {{portion of the}} electron transfer chain and does not involve cytochromes. Large and rapid changes of both the <b>terminal</b> and <b>alternate</b> respiratory activities occurred during the vegetative growth cycle. The kinetics of these changes in wild type were compared under some conditions which inhibit protein synthesis and others in which the nitrogen source was varied. The kinetics of the changes of the two forms of respiration of mutants differed from those normally exhibited by wild type, but with varied experimental conditions wild type {{could be made to}} resemble the mutants. The results of these studies are discussed in terms of a dynamic model of regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in the coordination of the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genomes...|$|R

40|$|To {{gain insight}} {{into the role of}} F-actin in the {{organization}} of synaptic vesicles at release sites, we examined the synaptic distribution of F-actin by using a unique synaptic preparation of frog target-deprived nerve terminals. In this preparation, imaging of the synaptic site was unobstructed by the muscle fiber cytoskeleton, allowing for the examination of hundreds of synaptic sites in their entirety in whole mounts. At target-deprived synaptic sites F-actin was distributed in a ladder-like pattern and was colocalized with β-fodrin. Surprisingly, F-actin stain, which we localized to the nerve terminal itself, did not overlap a synaptic vesicle marker, suggesting that it was concentrated in nonrelease domains of nerve terminals between clusters of synaptic vesicles. These findings suggest {{that the majority of the}} presynaptic F-actin is not involved in tethering synaptic vesicles.

During this process the nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas, which is released to the atmosphere.

40|$|ABSTRACT Type I signal {{peptidase}} (SPase) {{is essential}} for viability in wild-type bacteria because the terminal step of the bacterial general secretory pathway requires its proteolytic activity to release proteins from their membrane-bound N-terminal leader sequences after translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. Here, we identify the Staphylococcus aureus operon ayrRABC (SA 0337 to SA 0340) and show that once released from repression by AyrR, the protein products AyrABC together confer resis-tance to the SPase inhibitor arylomycinM 131 by providing an alternate and novel method of releasing translocated proteins. Thus, the derepression of ayrRABC allows cells to bypass the essentiality of SPase. We demonstrate that AyrABC functionally complements SPase by mediating the processing of the normally secreted proteins, albeit in some cases with reduced efficiency and either without cleavage or via cleavage at a site N-terminal to the canonical SPase cleavage site. Thus, ayrRABC encodes a secretion stress-inducible <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> step of the general secretory pathway. IMPORTANCE Addressing proteins for proper localization within or outside a cell in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes is often accomplished with intrinsic signals which mediate membrane translocation and which ultimately must be removed. The canoni-cal enzyme responsible {{for the removal of}} translocation signals is bacterial type I signal peptidase (SPase), which functions at the terminal step of the general secretory pathway and is thus essential in wild-type bacteria. Here, we identify a four-gene operon in S. aureus that encodes an <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> step of the general secretory pathway and thus makes SPase nonessential. The re-sults have important implications for protein secretion in bacteria and potentially for protein trafficking in prokaryotes and eu...|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} mutants of Ustilago maydis {{selected}} on a fungitoxic oxathiin lack of antimycin A-tolerant respiratory system which {{is present in}} wild-type cells.

Antimycin A-sensitive O 2 uptake and growth is found in half of the progeny from crosses of mutant to wild type. All antimycin A-sensitive segregants are somewhat more resistant to oxathiins than the antimycin A-resistant segregants. The respiration of the mutant is strongly inhibited by cyanide and azide at concentrations which stimulate respiration of the wild type. Respiration of both mutant and wild type is about equally inhibited by rotenone.

As the cells grew into stationary phase and the oxygen concentration of the medium dropped to essentially zero, an additional component believed to be cytochrome d was produced. Both the o- and d-type cytochromes might function as terminal oxidases. No a-type cytochromes could be detected at any stage of growth. Polarographic measurement of oxygen utilization revealed that cyanide and azide are effective inhibitors of the oxidation of ascorbate coupled with 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol or N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine in respiratory particles from either log-phase or stationary-phase cells. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- or succinate-dependent oxygen utilization, however, was sensitive to these inhibitors only in log-phase particles.

40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of Malka Peled Abstract. We {{consider}} a graph with colored edges. A trail (vertices may repeat but not edges) is called alternating when successive edges have different colors. Given a set of vertices called <b>terminals,</b> the <b>alternating</b> reachability problem is to find a trail connecting distinct terminals, if one exists. A special case with two colors is searching for an augmenting path with respect to a given matching. In another special case with two colors red and blue, the alternating cone is defined as the set of assignments of nonnegative weights to the edges such that at each vertex, the total red weight equals the total blue weight; in a companion paper we showed how the search for an integral weight vector within a given box in the alternating cone can be reduced to the alternating reachability problem in a 2 -colored graph. We define an obstacle, called a Tutte set, to the existence of an alternating trail connecting distinct terminals in a colored graph, and give a polynomial-time algorithm, generalizing the blossom algorithm of Edmonds, that finds either an alternating trail connecting distinct terminals or a Tutte set. We use Tutte sets to show that an an edge-colored bridgeless graph where each vertex has incident edges of at least two different colors has a closed alternating trail. A special case with two colors one of which forms a matching yields a combinatorial result of Giles and Seymour. We show that in a 2 -colored graph, the cone generated by the characteristic vectors of closed alternating trails is the intersection of the alternating cone with the cone generated by the characteristic vectors of cycles in the underlying graph...|$|R

The synaptic vesicles at release sites have been described as two physically distinct populations (Kelly, 1993). One group of vesicles, docked at the presynaptic membrane, appear poised for release via interactions between vesicular and presynaptic membrane proteins (Sollner et al., 1993 a,b).

The second algorithm is {{a modified version of}} the first one, which takes into account the topological advantages of multi stage interconnection networks during the decomposition process. The terminal reliability of some important fault-tolerant multi-stage interconnection networks has been evaluated using the second algorithm for the purpose of comparison. The complexities of the proposed algorithms are found to be highly polynomial in nature. The proposed method of multiple decomposition is compared with some similar decomposition methods. The simulated results confirm that the proposed decomposition method is much better than its counter parts.

To investigate how TEAs affect decomposition, we cultivated feedstock-adapted consortia (FACs) derived from two tropical forest soils collected from the ends of a rainfall gradient: organic matter-rich tropical cloud forest (CF) soils, which experience sustained low redox, and iron-rich tropical rain forest (RF) soils, which experience rapidly fluctuating redox. Communities were anaerobically passed through three transfers of 10 weeks each with switchgrass as a sole carbon (C) source; FACs were then amended with nitrate, sulfate, or iron oxide. Cmineralization and cellulase activities were higher in CF-FACs than in RF-FACs. Pyrosequencing of the small-subunit rRNA revealed members of the Firmicutes, Bacte-roidetes, and Alphaproteobacteria as dominant. RF- and CF-FAC communities were not different in microbial diversity or bio-mass. The RF-FACs, derived from fluctuating redox soils, were the most responsive to the addition of TEAs, while the CF-FACs were overall more efficient and productive, both on a per-gram switchgrass and a per-cell biomass basis.

40|$|There {{are strong}} evidences that Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} survives in a non-replicating {{state in the}} absence of oxygen in closed lesions and granuloma in vivo. In addition, M. tuberculosis is acid-resistant, allowing mycobacteria to survive in acidic, inflamed lesions. The ability of M. tuberculosis to resist to acid was recently shown to contribute to the bacillus virulence although the mechanisms involved have yet to be deciphered. In this study, we report that M. tuberculosis resistance to acid is oxygen-dependent; whereas aerobic mycobacteria were resistant to a mild acid challenge (pH 5. 5) as previously reported, we found microaerophilic and hypoxic mycobacteria to be more sensitive to acid. In hypoxic conditions, mild-acidity promoted the dissipation of the protonmotive force, rapid ATP depletion and cell death. Exogenous nitrate, the most effective <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor after molecular oxygen, protected hypoxic mycobacteria from acid stress. Nitrate-mediated resistance to acidity was not observed for a respiratory nitrate reductase NarGH knock-out mutant strain. Furthermore, we found that nitrate respiration was equally important in protecting hypoxic non-replicating mycobacteria from radical nitrogen species toxicity. Overall, these data shed light on a new role for nitrate respiration in protecting M. tuberculosis from acidity and reactive nitrogen species, two environmental stresses likely encountered by the pathoge...|$|R
40|$|The surB gene was {{identified}} as a gene product required for Escherichia coli cells to exit stationary phase at 37 degrees C under aerobic conditions. surB was shown to be the same as cydC, whose product is required for the proper assembly and activity of cytochrome d oxidase. Cytochrome d oxidase, encoded by the cydAB operon, is one of two <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> cytochrome oxidases that function during aerobic electron transport in E. coli. Mutations inactivating the cydAB operon also cause a temperature-sensitive defect in exiting stationary phase, but the phenotype is not as severe as it is for surB mutants. In this study, we examined the phenotypes of surB 1 delta(cydAB) double mutants and the ability of overexpression of cytochrome o oxidase to suppress the temperature-sensitive stationary-phase-exit defect of surB 1 and delta(cydAB) mutants and analyzed spontaneous suppressors of surB 1. Our results indicate that the severe temperature-sensitive defect in exiting stationary phase of surB 1 mutants is due both to the absence of terminal cytochrome oxidase activity and to the presence of a defective cytochrome d oxidase. Membrane vesicles prepared from wild-type, surB 1, and delta(cydAB) strains produced superoxide radicals at the same rate in vitro. Therefore, the aerobic growth defects of the surB 1 and delta(cydAB) strains are not due to enhanced superoxide production resulting from the block in aerobic electron transport...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{evergreen}} perennials undergo recurrent flush growth, {{and their}} <b>terminal</b> buds <b>alternate</b> between growth and dormancy. In {{sharp contrast to}} intensive studies on bud development in temperate deciduous trees, there is little information about bud development regulation in tropical trees. In this study, litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) {{was used as a}} model tropical perennial for morphological characterization and transcriptomic analysis of bud development. Litchi buds are naked with apical meristem embraced by rudimentary leaves, which are brown at dormant stage (Stage I). They swell and turn greenish as buds break (Stage II), and as growth accelerates, the rudimentary leaves elongate and open exposing the inner leaf primodia. With the outgrowth of the needle-like leaflets, bud growth reaches a maximum (Stage III). When leaflets expand, bud growth cease with the abortion of the rudimentary leaves at upper positions (Stage IV). Then buds turn brown and reenter dormant status. Budbreak occurs again when new leaves become hard green. Buds at four stages (Stage I to IV) were collected for respiration measurements and in-depth RNA sequencing. Respiration rate was lowest at Stage I and highest at Stage II, decreasing towards growth cessation. RNA sequencing obtained over 5 Gb data from each of the bud samples and de novo assembly generated a total of 59999 unigenes, 40119 of which were annotated. Pair-wise comparison of gene expression between stages, gene profiling across stages, GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, and the expression patterns of 17 major genes highlighted by principal component (PC) analysis displayed significant changes in stress resistance, hormone signal pathways, circadian rhythm, photosynthesis, cell division, carbohydrate metabolism, programmed cell death during bud development, which might be under epigenetic control involving chromatin methylation. The qPCR results of 8 selected unigenes with high PC scores agreed with the RPKM values obtained from RNA-seq. Three Short Vegetative Phase (SVP) genes, namely LcSVP 1, LcSVP 2 and LcSVP 3 displayed different expression patterns, suggesting their differential roles in bud development regulation.

40|$|Zn is {{concentrated}} into presynaptic vesicles at many central synapses and is {{released into the}} synaptic cleft by nerve terminal stimulation. There is strong evidence that synaptically released Zn modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission, although there is debate concerning the peak concentration it reaches in the synaptic cleft. Glycine receptors (GlyRs), which mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and brainstem, are potentiated by low nanomolar Zn and inhibited by micromolar Zn. Mutations that selectively ablate Zn potentiation result in hyperekplexia phenotypes suggesting that Zn is a physiological regulator ofglycinergic neurotransmission. There is, however, little evidence that Zn is stored presynaptically at glycinergic <b>terminals</b> and an <b>alternate</b> possibility is that GlyRs are modulated by constitutively bound Zn.

By comparing the effect of Zn chelation on glycinergic IPSCs with the effects of defined Zn and glycine concentrations applied rapidly to the same recombinant GlyRs in outside-out patches, we inferred that synaptic Zn rises to at least 1 µM following a single presynaptic stimulation. Moreover, using the fast, high-affinity chelator, ZX 1, we found no evidence for tonic Zn 2 + bound constitutively to high affinity GlyR binding sites. We conclude that diffusible Zn reaches 1 µM or higher and is therefore likely to be phasically released in artificial glycinergic synapses...|$|R

In recent years the availability of high fidelity terminal area track data has made it possible to increase the granularity of airport and airspace performance analysis.

The analysis provides insight into track distances flown and track time for <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> arrival flows (i. e. from the final waypoint in the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) to the runway threshold via a type of approach). The methodology is applied to 35 days of NOP track data for Chicago TRACON (C 90) for arrivals into MDW. Arrivals into MDW landing to the north-west on 31 C and to the north-east on 4 R exhibit the shortest average track distance (28. 42 NM and 29. 81 NM.). Arrivals landing to the south-east on 13 C exhibit the highest mean track distance of 38. 9 NM. Track distance/time is least for VFR approaches onto all runways. When IMC conditions exist, RNP approaches provide 6 - 10 % savings in track distance/time over ILS approaches. One unexpected result is that RNP approaches exhibit the same variance in track distance/time as ILS approaches.

40|$|The fumarate reductase enzyme complex, encoded by the frdABCD operon, allows Escherichia coli {{to utilize}} fumarate as a {{terminal}} electron acceptor for anaerobic oxidative phosphorylation. To analyze {{the expression of}} fumarate reductase, protein and operon fusions were constructed between the frdA and the lacZ genes and introduced onto the E. coli chromosome at the lambda attachment site. Expression of beta-galactosidase from either fusion was increased 10 -fold during anaerobic versus aerobic cell growth, increased an additional 1. 5 -fold {{by the presence of}} fumarate, the substrate, and decreased 23 -fold by nitrate, a preferred electron acceptor. The addition of trimethylamine-N-oxide as an electron acceptor did not significantly alter frdA'-'lacZ expression. Control of frd operon expression is therefore exerted at the transcriptional level in response to the availability of the electron acceptors oxygen, fumarate, and nitrate. Anaerobic induction of frdA'-'lacZ expression was impaired in an fnr mutant and was restored when the fnr+ gene was provided in trans, thus establishing that the fnr gene product, Fnr, is responsible for the anaerobic activation of frd operon expression. Nitrate repression of frdA'-'lacZ expression was observed under either aerobic or anaerobic cell growth conditions in both wild-type and fnr mutant strains, demonstrating that the mechanism for nitrate repression is independent of nitrate respiration and oxygen control imparted by Fnr. Studies performed with a fnr'-'lacZ protein fusion confirmed that the fnr gene is expressed both aerobically and anaerobically.

Transposon (Tn 5) mutagenesis of B. abortus and the subsequent screening of mutants for sensitivity to killing in murine macrophages and in the mouse model led to the identification of mutants which were severely attenuated for intracellular survival. One group of mutants was interrupted in cydB, a gene {{that is part of}} the cydAB operon encoding cytochrome bd oxidase, which catalyzes an <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> electron transport step in bacterial respiration. The elevated affinity for molecular oxygen of this enzyme in Escherichia coli has suggested that it is involved in the protection of sensitive enzymatic activities such as those of hydrogenases and nitrogenases from damage. B. abortus cydB::Tn 5 strains exhibited heightened sensitivity to the respiratory inhibitors zinc and azide, highly reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide, low pH, and attenuated virulence in the mouse model of infection. Virulence was restored by an intact copy of cydAB or by B. abortus genes encoding the oxidative radical-scavenging enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase or catalase. These results suggest a bifunctional role for the products of the cydAB operon, both in preventing the buildup of oxidative free radicals and in detoxifying the intracellular compartment, thus indicating the importance of these products in preventing intracellular destruction. Intracellular conditions that favor expression of the cydAB operon are under investigation and may be linked to the acid sensitivity also observed in this strain...|$|R

We sought to estimate the peak Zn 2 + concentration in the glycinergic synaptic cleft {{as a means of}} evaluating whether {{it is likely to be}} synaptically released. We employed ‘artificial’ synapses because they permit the insertion of engineered  GlyRs with defined Zn 2 + sensitivities into synapses. By comparing the effect of Zn 2 + chelation on glycinergic IPSCs with the effects of defined Zn 2 + and glycine concentrations applied rapidly to the same recombinant GlyRs in outside-out patches, we inferred that synaptic Zn 2 + rises to at least 1 M following a single presynaptic stimulation. Moreover, using the fast, high-affinity chelator, ZX 1, we found no evidence for tonic Zn 2 + bound constitutively to high affinity GlyR binding sites. We conclude that diffusible Zn 2 + reaches 1 M or higher and is therefore likely to be phasically released in artificial glycinergic synapses...|$|R
5000|$|Dynix was {{originally}} developed around the ADDS Viewpoint A2 terminal's escape sequences, because ADDS terminals were {{the de facto}} standard on the PICK-based mainframes on which Dynix was created. Shortly after Dynix started being deployed to libraries around the country, requests started coming back that <b>alternate</b> <b>terminals</b> be provided for patron use; children would bang on the keyboards or throw books at the terminals, or use unauthorized key sequences to mess up the programming. In response, Dynix asked Wyse to develop such a terminal; Wyse created the WY-30, which was a stripped-down version of the best-selling terminal ever made, the WY-60. The swivel base was removed so that the terminal sat flat on whatever surface it was placed on; what the unit now lacked in viewing-angle adjustability, it made up for in physical stability (it could not be knocked over {{by the force of}} a child). A specially-designed keyboard reduced the number of keys from 101 to 83, mainly by removing all the function keys; this was designed to keep users out of the internal setup functions {{and other parts of the}} software they [...] "weren't supposed to be going". To maintain compatibility with how Dynix was already written, the WY-30 supported the Adds Viewpoint A2 emulation, which was actually one of the only emulations on the terminal. They WY-30 had very few emulations compared to most Wyse products, and notably did not support VT100 or any other ANSI emulations. Years later, when the Dynix company was moving from Ultimate computers running Pick/OS to IBM computers running AIX and uniVerse, compatibility for VT100/102/340 terminals was added to the software; then, other models of Wyse terminal started coming into favor, such as the WY-60 and WY-150, which were easier on the eyes and hands than the WY-30 was.|$|R
40|$|During the {{transition}} from the aerobic steady state with succinate as substrate to anaerobiosis, in suspensions of skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus) mitochondria treated with antimycin A, cytochrome b 562 becomes reoxidized to the extent of about 20 %, synchronously with the reduction of cytochrome c 549. This reoxidation occurs in both the absence and presence of m-chlorobenzhydroxamic acid, a specific inhibitor for the <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> oxidase of plant mitochondria. A flavoprotein component, amounting to 13 % to 15 % of the total nonfluorescent mitochondrial flavoprotein, undergoes reduction synchronously with the oxidation of cytochrome b 562 during the aerobic to anaerobic transition with succinate as substrate in the presence of both antimycin A and m-chlorobenzhydroxamic acid. This flavoprotein component remains reduced in the presence of cyanide. The half-time for reduction of the flavoprotein component and cytochrome c 549 and for oxidation of cytochrome b 562 during the aerobic to anaerobic transition with succinate as substrate in the presence of both antimycin A and m-chlorobenzhydroxamic acid is 2 seconds. The half-times for oxidation of cytochrome c 549 and the flavoprotein component are 2. 1 and 170 milliseconds, respectively, during the anaerobic to aerobic transition induced by addition of 14 μm O 2 to the mitochondrial suspensions. The half-time for reduction of cytochrome b 562 under these conditions is 150 milliseconds, synchronous with the flavoprotein component. The synchrony of the flavoprotein oxidation and of the cytochrome b 562 reduction at a rate much slower than that of cytochrome c 549 oxidation implies that, in antimycin-treated plant mitochondria, the state of the cytochrome b 562 /antimycin complex is regulated by the redox state of this flavoprotein component, rather than by cytochrome c 549. It is tentatively suggested that these two components {{are not part of the}} main sequence of the respiratory chain, but may be part of a multienzyme complex active in the hydroxylation reactions required for ubiquinone biosynthesis in the inner mitochondrial membrane...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the alternating patterns of gating-charge exposure, each of the Cin and Cout states seems to be stabilized by a distinct group of interaction within the VS domain, including salt-bridge bonds. For instance, in the Cout structure of NaVAb/ 3 RVY, residues E 59 S 2, R 63 S 2, D 80 S 3, and R 108 S 4 (R 4) form a charge cluster in the cytosolic half of the VS domain. It can be envisioned that, in the Cin state, these interactions are lost; instead, new interactions are formed in the extracellular half of the VS domain, including a salt-bridge bond between E 32 S 1 and R 99 S 4 (R 1). Similarly, in the Cin structure of TPC 1 / 5 DQQ, E 511 S 3 –R 531 S 4 (R 0) and D 500 S 3 –R 540 S 4 (R 3) pairs are observed to form two salt-bridge bonds. These distinct clusters of charge pairs probably contribute to the two-state mechanism of VS by stabilizing either the Cin or Cout state (Papazian et al. 1995). The role played by paired charges in stabilizing of the VS domain appears {{to be similar to}} that of A-like motifs conserved in MFS transporters, where these motifs stabilize their transporters in the two terminal states of a functional cycle (Zhang et al. 2015). Point mutations in such clusters, if breaking the charge pairs, will result in reduced stability of either the Cin or Cout state, skewing the two-state transition process. For example, mutations at the basic residues in the cytosolic half of S 4 cause a right shift of the I–V curve of the rat Na+ channel II, indicating destabilization of the Cout state. In contrast, mutations in the extracellular half of S 4 result in a left shift (Stuhmer et al. 1989). Similarly, mutations at acidic residues that are involved in charge-pairing often show drastic effects. For example, the D 60 K mutation in a cytosolic charge cluster of NaChBac shifts the I–V curve 75 -mV towards depolarizing potentials (i.e., more difficult to be activated) (Zhao et al. 2004), presumably by over-stabilizing the Cin state via electrostatic interaction with ∆ΨM and by destabilizing the Cout state via disrupting charge-pairing. In addition, substituting R 1 with a small side-chain residue resulted in formation of a cation channel running through the VS domain in its Cin conformation (Tombola et al. 2005 b), presumably by breaking the seal formed by the charge paring in the Cin state. Moreover, folding defects from mutations that neutralize basic residues in S 4 can be suppressed by neutralization of acidic residues in either S 2 or S 3 (Papazian et al. 1995). Of particular interest are insights gained from the charge-reversal mutations in the Drosophila Shaker KV channel (Papazian et al. 1995; Tiwari-Woodruff et al. 2000), in which the paired, charged residues in the VS domains were mutually switched yet the mutants maintained the channel activity. Taken together, while unpaired charges are more likely to contribute to the gating-charges, the paired charges stabilize the <b>terminal</b> states, and <b>alternating</b> stabilization of both states is essential for proper functioning of the VS domain.|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of evaluating {{a new technology}} in a whole-farm context using a linear programming framework are well known. Linear programming allows the joint evaluation of concurrent farm activities, while considering the costs and returns of all enterprises and any resource adjustments imposed by adoption of the technology. This Report provides a rationale for and description of a whole-farm linear programming model {{that can be used}} for the economic evaluation of new technologies that are applicable to beef/sheep grazing farms typical of the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. In this farming system, the whole-farm focus incorporates various aspects of the pasture base, resource constraints and sheep and cattle interactions. An overview of economic tools that are available to assess technologies at the farm level is provided first, listing some of the major benefits and limitations of each of these various techniques. A representative farm for the selected farming system is then developed and a whole-farm linear program based on this representative farm is described in some detail. A series of modelling experiments is undertaken to examine variations of the base model and their impact on the resulting technology evaluation. An example technology, involving the genetic improvement of beef cattle for improved feed efficiency (NFE), is evaluated. The optimal farm plan for a "typical" (single) year is generated, given the objective of maximising farm total gross margin. Three enterprises are selected: 1, 108 first-cross ewes, 1, 732 Merino wethers and a beef herd of 127 cows producing 18 month old heavy feeder steers (HFS) at 448 kg liveweight and excess heifers sold as 9 month old weaners. For this farm plan, the annual operating budget shows a total gross margin for the farm of $ 86, 191. The optimal farm plan for the representative farm is found to be sensitive to relatively small changes in input or output prices and production parameters. Only small improvements in a number of the individual enterprise gross margins would result in them displacing the currently selected enterprises. These results suggest relatively similar profitability levels between these sheep and beef enterprises. This would be anticipated given that all the enterprises described in this report were identified by local experts as being common in the Northern Tablelands. Further, the relatively small differences in enterprise profitability when viewed in a whole farm context also reflect the similar resources that each of the enterprises require, making them readily substitutable. For new technologies that have dynamic attributes, measuring the cashflow over time becomes important. Genetic traits in ruminants that have long biological lags are such technologies. This means that a single-year equilibrium model will be unable to effectively measure the costs of introducing the new technology over time. In the case of the NFE technology in beef cattle, any herd expansion that is possible as a result of the trait is measured by the opportunity cost of heifer sales forgone that are instead retained to increase the breeding herd. These herd dynamics can be represented explicitly within a multi-period version of a whole-farm LP model. The NFE cow enterprise is offered to the model, with the initial sheep enterprises set the same as the base case (1, 108 prime lamb producing ewes, 1, 732 19 -micron Merino wethers). The model again selects 127 HFS producing cows in the first year, but the new optimal farm plan is to invest in the new technology by purchasing NFE-superior bulls in successive years and expanding the cow herd while concurrently decreasing the scale of the Merino wether enterprise. Substitution of Merino wethers for NFE cows occurs up to year 12 after which additional breeding cows are possible from their increasing net feed efficiency alone. There is an increase in cow numbers of 12. 6 per cent by year 25, which equates to an improvement in the NPV per breeding cow per year over the base herd of $ 5. 02, using a 5 per cent discount rate. Other experiments reported include adding constraints for fixed costs, family drawings and an overdraft facility; alternate discount rates for the NPV calculations; <b>alternate</b> <b>terminal</b> values for the livestock assets at the end of the simulation period; and a post-optimality risk analysis. This study has highlighted several additional {{benefits of}} evaluating a technology in a whole-farm multi-period linear programming framework. First, apart from determining the type and size of the optimal farm enterprise mix and the optimal value of the objective function, whole-farm multi-period linear programming also provides important additional information including shadow costs and prices and constraint slacks, and how they change over time. Shadow costs of activities show how sensitive the optimal farm enterprise mix is to changes in the gross margins of alternate farm activities not included in the current farm plan. The shadow prices for resources indicates how much a farm manager could pay for additional units of a limiting resource, for example, additional labour. Second, in terms of the specific NFE technology examined in this report, it would appear that there may well be regions where such feed efficiencies may be of greater benefit due to particularly large variations in pasture growth patterns throughout the year. The Northern Tablelands with its recognised winter feed deficit may be one such area. This information may be of benefit to researchers in extending the NFE technology to farmers. Third, the deterministic multi-period version of the model highlighted the impact of the inclusion of overhead and capital constraints in the modelling process in determining the potential adoption of a technology by a farm manager. The availability and cost of capital is shown to influence the extent to which the NFE technology may be adopted by an individual farm business. Fourth, from a modelling perspective, the effect of uncertain terminal values and the bearing that they have on measuring the level of adoption of a new technology is an area for further investigation. Finally, the impact of risk was assessed in this study post-optimally by the inclusion of stochastic output prices in the optimal whole farm budgets. This is an area for further research, including the potential of alternate modelling techniques such as MOTAD programming or stochastic dynamic programming. However due to size constraints, such approaches may necessitate trade-offs in terms of the detail of whole-farm models to which they are applied.
