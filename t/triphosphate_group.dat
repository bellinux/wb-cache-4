[...] Through {{a series of}} three steps, the cap is added to the first nucleotide's 5' hydroxyl group of the growing mRNA strand while transcription is still occurring. [...] First, RNA 5' triphosphatase hydrolyzes the 5' <b>triphosphate</b> <b>group</b> to make diphospate-RNA. Then, the addition of GMP by guanylyltransferase produces the guanosine cap. Last, RNA methyltransferase transfers a methyl group to the guanosine cap to yield 7-methylguanosine cap that is attached to the 5' end of the transcript. These three enzymes, collectively called the capping enzymes, are only able to catalyze their respective reactions when attached to RNA polymerase II, an enzyme necessary for the transcription of DNA into pre-mRNA. When this complex of RNA polymerase II and the capping enzymes is achieved, the capping enzymes are able to add the cap to the mRNA while it is produced by RNA polymerase II.|$|E
50|$|The Serine/Threonine {{residue of}} the {{substrate}} peptide is orientated {{in such a}} way that the hydroxyl group faces towards the gamma phosphate group of the bound ATP molecule. Both the substrate, ATP, and two Mg2+ ions form intensive contacts with the catalytic subunit of PKA. In the active conformation, the C helix packs against the N-terminal lobe and the Aspartate residue of the conserved DFG motif chelates the Mg2+ ions, assisting in positioning the ATP substrate. The <b>triphosphate</b> <b>group</b> of ATP points out of the adenosine pocket for transfer of gamma-phosphate to the Serine/Threonine of the peptide substrate. There are several conserved residues, include Glutamate (E) 91 and Lysine (K) 72, that mediate the positioning of alpha- and beta-phosphate groups. The hydroxyl group the peptide substrate's Serine/Threonine attacks the gamma phosphate group at the phosphorus via an SN2 nucleophilic reaction, which results in the transfer of the terminal phosphate to the peptide substrate and cleavage of the phosphodiester bond between the beta-phosphate and the gamma-phosphate groups. PKA acts as a model for understanding protein kinase biology, with the position of the conserved residues helping to distinguish the active protein kinase and inactive pseudokinase members of the human kinome.|$|E

The intracellular pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA 5 are essential for interferon induction by viral RNAs containing 5 ' triphosphates or double-stranded structures, respectively. Viruses with a negative-stranded RNA genome are an important group of pathogens causing emerging and re-emerging diseases. We investigated the ability of genomic RNAs from substantial representatives of this virus group to induce interferon via RIG-I or MDA 5. RNAs isolated from particles of Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa virus, and Rift Valley fever virus strongly activated the interferon-beta promoter. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that interferon induction depended on RIG-I, but not MDA 5, and phosphatase treatment revealed a requirement for the RNA 5 ' <b>triphosphate</b> <b>group.</b> In contrast, genomic RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus did not trigger interferon induction.

Consequently, RIG-I is unable to bind the RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus.

For the first time we take this competition into account to obtain the intrinsic binding constants, describing a method that is generally applicable.

The reaction is initiated by soaking NTP substrates and divalent cations into the RNAP and promoter DNA complex crystal, where the phosphodiester bond formation is completed in about 40 minutes. This slow reaction allowed us to monitor the changes of RNAP and DNA conformations as well as bindings of substrate and metal through Raman spectra taken every 5 minutes. Recently published snapshot X-ray crystal structures along the same reaction pathway assisted the spectroscopic assignments {{of changes in the}} enzyme and DNA, while isotopically labeled NTP substrates allowed differentiation of the Raman spectra of bases in substrates and DNA. We observed that substrates are bound at 2 - 7 minutes after commencing soaking, the O-helix completes its conformational change, and that binding of both divalent metals required for catalysis in the active site changes the conformation of the ribose triphosphate at position + 1. These are followed by a slower decrease of NTP <b>triphosphate</b> <b>groups</b> due to phosphodiester bond formation that reaches completion at about 15 minutes, and even slower complete release of the divalent metals at about 40 minutes. We have also shown that the O-helix movement can be driven by substrate binding only.

The initial purpose of the present studies was to examine the effect of the inclusion of cell wash steps on the quantitation of intracellular ZDV. Ten milliliters of whole blood collected from healthy volunteers was spiked with increasing ZDV concentrations (0. 187, 0. 375, 1. 87, and 3. 75 microM), allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 1 h, and separated into whole-blood components by a density gradient procedure. A mononuclear cell pellet was obtained, reconstituted with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and split into two aliquots, one of which was not washed at all and the other of which was washed four times with 1 ml of PBS. All samples were analyzed by ZDV radioimmunoassay (RIA) after a 1 : 1 dilution with either 1 mg of alkaline phosphatase (type 1 -S; Sigma) per ml or PBS. Parent ZDV was measured in those samples which were not treated with the enzyme, while total ZDV was measured in those samples which were exposed to alkaline phosphatase (21 degrees C for 1 h). The result of the difference between the two samples is total phosphorylated ZDV. During the experiment, evidence of alkaline phosphatase interference with the RIA became apparent, confusing interpretation of intracellular ZDV concentrations. This evidence was based on three sets of data. First, wash samples showed increases in ZDV concentrations of as great as 0. 127 microgramM after exposure to alkaline phosphatase, even though on microscopic inspection the wash samples were acellular. Second, the sum of total ZDV recovered from the four wash samples plus the washed cell pellet was as much as 14 -fold greater than the total ZDV measured in the unwashed cell pellet. Theoretically, at least, these two entities should be equal. Finally, control samples of alkaline phosphatase in PBS (0. 5 mg/ml) run directly through the assay measured false ZDV levels ranging from 0. 002 to 0. 075 microgramM (0. 6 to 20 ng/ml). Alkaline phosphatase is frequently used to measure phosphorylated anabolites of ZDV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{function of}} ATP as energy equivalent in nature {{has resulted in}} a common folding pattern of ATP-binding proteins.

In consequence, immobilized C 8 - and N- 6 - modified ATP analogues are frequently used for affinity purification of ATPases or kinases. To combine this unique recognition principle with the fascinating properties of self-assembly, we have synthesized a novel class of hydrolyzable and nonhydrolyzable ATP-lipids where the nucleotides are covalently attached via C 8 - or N- 6 -position of the adenine ring to a synthetic lipid. These ATP-lipids were characterized by various enzyme assays in micellar solution, resulting in ATPase and competition activities that are comparable to their free counterparts. The specific docking of actin as a model of an ATP-binding protein to ATP-lipid monolayers was followed by film balance technique and epifluorescence microscopy.

Due to the coupling of actin to ATP-lipid bilayers drastic changes in the viscoelastic properties and shape transitions were observed by phase contrast microscopy.

40|$|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is {{responsible}} for large and recurrent outbreaks of acute febrile illness among humans and domesticated animals in Africa. It belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, and its negative-stranded RNA genome consists of three segments. Here, we report the establishment and characterization of two different systems to rescue the RVFV wild-type strain ZH 548. The first system {{is based on the}} BHK- 21 cell clone BSR-T 7 / 5, which stably expresses T 7 RNA polymerase (T 7 pol). Rescue of wild-type RVFV was achieved with three T 7 pol-driven cDNA plasmids representing the viral RNA segments in the antigenomic sense. The second system involves 293 T cells transfected with three RNA pol I-driven plasmids for the viral segments and two RNA pol II-driven support plasmids to express the viral polymerase components L and N. It is known that the 59 <b>triphosphate</b> <b>group</b> of T 7 pol transcripts strongly activates the antiviral interferon system via the intracellular RNA receptor RIG-I. Nonetheless, both the T 7 pol and the pol I/II system were of similar efficiency. This was even true for the rescue of a RVFV mutant lacking the interferon antagonist nonstructural proteins. Further experiments demonstrated that the unresponsiveness of BHK- 21 and BSR-T 7 / 5 cells to T 7 pol transcripts is most probably due to a deficiency in the RIG-I pathway. Our reverse genetics systems now enable us to manipulate the genome of RVFV and study its virulence mechanisms. Moreover, the finding that BHK-derived cell lines have a compromised RIG-I pathway may explain their suitability for propagating and rescuing a wide variety of viruses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The lazaroid U 74500 A is a 21 -aminosteroid that {{inhibits}} {{lipid peroxidation}} and attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury. We examined {{the effect of}} U 74500 A on heart preservation {{with the use of}} a clinically relevant canine orthotopic heart transplantation model. Methods and results: Six donor dogs (group L) were pretreated intravenously with U 74500 A (10 mg/kg), and the dogs without pretreatment served as a control (group C, n = 6). The donor heart was preserved in cold University of Wisconsin solution for 24 hours. The heart was then transplanted orthotopically. Myocardial biopsy was performed to measure the adenosine triphosphate level at the end of ischemia. Before reperfusion, recipients in group L received another dose of U 74500 A (10 mg/kg) intravenously. After 3 hours of reperfusion, left ventricular function was evaluated by left ventricular pressure-volume relations {{with the use of a}} Millar catheter and conductance catheter, thereby deriving the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, the slope of the stroke work–end-diastolic volume relation, and the slope of the maximum dP/dt–end-diastolic volume relation. At the same time, serum creatine kinase MB isoenzyme and lipid peroxide levels were measured. The slopes of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, the stroke work–end-diastolic volume relation, and the maximum dP/dt–end-diastolic volume relation for group L were significantly higher than those for group C. The adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> levels for <b>group</b> L were significantly higher than those for group C. Serum creatine kinase MB isoenzyme and lipid peroxide levels for group L were significantly lower than those for group C. Conclusions: Inhibition of lipid peroxidation by the administration of U 74500 A was effective for 24 -hour canine cardiac preservation. These results indicate that U 74500 A is a promising agent for heart allograft preservation. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1996; 112 : 1017 - 26...|$|R
40|$|The three {{dimensional}} {{structure of}} the neuronal calcium-sensor protein calexcitin from Loligo pealei has been determined by X-ray analysis at a resolution of 1. 8 Å. Calexcitin is up-regulated following Pavlovian conditioning and {{has been shown to}} regulate potassium channels and the ryanodine receptor. Thus calexcitin is implicated in neuronal excitation and plasticity. The overall structure is predominantly helical and compact with a pronounced hydrophobic core between the N- and C-terminal domains of the molecule. The structure consists of four EF-hand motifs although only the first three EF hands are involved in binding calcium ions; the C-terminal EF-hand lacks the amino acids required for calcium binding. The overall structure is quite {{similar to that of the}} sarcoplasmic calcium binding protein from Amphioxus although the sequence identity is very low at 31 %. The structure shows that the two amino acids of calexcitin phosphorylated by protein kinase C are close to the domain interface in three dimensions and thus phosphorylation is likely to regulate the opening of the domains that is probably required for binding to target proteins. There is evidence that calexcitin is a GTPase and the residues which have been implicated by mutagenesis in its GTPase activity are in a short but highly conserved region of 3 - 10 helix close to the C-terminus. This helix resides in a large loop that is partly sandwiched between the N- and C-terminal domains suggesting that GTP binding may also require or may cause domain opening. The structure possesses a pronounced electropositive crevice, in the vicinity of the 3 - 10 helix, that might provide an initial docking site for the <b>triphosphate</b> <b>group</b> of GTP. These findings elucidate a number of the reported functions of calexcitin with implications for neuronal signalling...|$|E
40|$|The innate immune {{pathways}} that {{stimulate the}} expression of cytokines and proapoptotic factors in response to infection are triggered by the activation of the cytosolic receptors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA 5). Activation of both receptors {{occurs as a result}} of binding to RNA. MDA 5 only recognizes double stranded forms of RNA, whereas RIG-I is capable of recognizing both single and double stranded RNA. In vivo, MDA 5 is known to be stimulated by long (> 1 kb) strands of RNA, forming filaments along the phosphate backbone. However, the manner in which MDA 5 can recognize the terminal end of its RNA ligand is uncertain. I have examined the mechanism of binding of the MDA 5 protein by comparing MDA 5 binding to short (< 18 bp) blunt RNA, 5 ? triphosphate RNA, and RNA with a 3 ? or 5 ? overhang. It is shown that while the MDA 5 protein regulatory domain (RD) is essential for RNA recognition, the MDA 5 RD only weakly recognizes short double stranded RNA ligands with overhangs or a 5 ? <b>triphosphate</b> <b>group.</b> The Cys 951 residue was shown to disrupt stability of the MDA 5 RD-RNA complex. Binding analyses were performed using a combination of SDS-PAGE, gel filtration analysis, and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. In addition, structural data was gathered by crystallization of the MDA 5 RD-RNA complex using X-ray crystallography. These results help to establish the manner in which MDA 5 is regulated predominantly to the binding of long RNA ligands. Also included in this document is structural data on the dimer form of the PepQ protein from E. coli. PepQ is a highly conserved proline peptidase that has a secondary activity of hydrolyzing organophosphorus triesters, toxic compounds found in many pesticides. The PepQ protein was crystallized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction.
