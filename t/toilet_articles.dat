25|$|Numerous famous {{guests have}} {{stayed at the}} hotel. Claude Monet and James Whistler both stayed at the hotel and painted or drew views, from their rooms, of the River Thames. The Savoy {{featured}} prominently in guest Oscar Wilde's trial for gross indecency. Other celebrity guests in the hotel's early decades included the future King Edward VII, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso, Lillie Langtry, H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Nellie Melba, Charlie Chaplin, Al Jolson, Errol Flynn, Fred Astaire, Marlene Dietrich, Lionel Barrymore, Harry Truman, Audrey Hepburn, Judy Garland, Josephine Baker, Cary Grant, Babe Ruth, Ivor Novello and NoÃ«l Coward. The hotel kept records of its guests' preferences, {{so that it could}} provide for them in advance. For Coward, the staff made history by taking the first photographs of a hotel guest's <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> so that they could lay them out in his bathroom exactly as he liked them. They made sure to provide a fireproof eiderdown quilt to Barrymore, as he always smoked while reading in bed.|$|E
2500|$|... "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen" [...] {{broke the}} record for the highest {{percentage}} of homes with television sets to watch a television series. Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down {{in some parts of the}} city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the <b>toilet.</b> <b>Articles</b> copied into Alan Alda's book The Last Days of M*A*S*H include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York City public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the City's history. They attributed this to the fact that in the three minutes after the finale ended, around 77% of the people of New York City flushed their toilets. These stories have all since been identified as part of an urban legend dating back to the days of the Amos and Andy radio program in the 1930s.|$|E

50|$|Aldi specialises in staple items, such as food, beverages, <b>toilet</b> paper, {{sanitary}} <b>articles,</b> {{and other}} inexpensive household items. Many {{of its products}} are own brands, {{with the number of}} other brands usually limited to a maximum of two for a given item. This increases sales for each article, and lets Aldi shops be smaller than stores with more brand choice. This practice let Aldi avoid price tags, even before the introduction of barcode scanners. On many of its own brands, if feasible, Aldi will place multiple barcodes on products to speed the check out process.|$|R

60|$|The two {{newcomers}} {{began to}} assist, Vannicock placing {{on the ground}} the small bag containing Laura's <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> {{that he had been}} carrying. The barrowman soon returned with another load, and all continued work for nearly a half-hour, when a coachman came out from the shadows to the north.|$|E
60|$|On a chair rested Mr. Rover's suitcase, locked but unstrapped. On {{the bureau}} were his comb and brush, a whisk broom, {{and some other}} <b>toilet</b> <b>articles.</b> On some hooks hung a coat and a cap. They glanced into the bathroom, and in a cup on the marble {{washstand}} saw his toothbrush.|$|E
60|$|The key to No. 216 had {{not been}} turned in at the office, but was missing. With a pass-key they {{unlocked}} the door of Alora's room and found her suit case open, her <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> lying upon the dresser and her nightrobe neatly folded ready for packing. Her hat was missing, however, and the little jacket she wore with her tailored suit.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought it}} was a stranger, an intruder. But it was veritably her husband, in a new suit that was {{fiercely}} pressed and shaped, in new, gleaming, ox-blood shoes, with a hair-cut and a barber shave. He was bending over the bed, which was piled with new shirts, Afro-American ties, new <b>toilet</b> <b>articles,</b> and he was packing a new suit-case.|$|E
60|$|Curtis took Winters {{into his}} own bedroom and put its <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> at his service and left him. As the sheriff came out into the Captain's library five minutes later, it was plain he had washed away {{a large part of}} his ferocity; his hair, {{plastered}} down smooth, represented the change in his mental condition--his quills were laid. He was, in fact, fairly meek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's read Alora's room," [...] said she, {{while her}} companions stood listening. [...] "To begin with, {{we see her}} night-dress nicely folded and her <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> {{arranged}} in neat order on the dresser. Chambermaid did that, for Alora is not neat. Proving that her stuff was just strewn around and the orderly maid put things straight. Which leads to the supposition that Alora was led away rather suddenly." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{man held}} up a dressing-gown and escorted him to an {{unexpectedly}} modern bathroom {{at the end of}} the corridor. When Quest returned, his <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> were all laid out for him with prim precision; the window was wide open, the blinds drawn, and a soft breeze was stealing through into the room. Below him, the park, looking more beautiful than ever in the morning sunshine, stretched away to a vista of distant meadowlands and cornfields, with here and there a little farm-house and outbuildings, gathered snugly together. The servant, who had heard him leave the bathroom, reappeared.|$|E
60|$|Then Dorothy {{showed them}} through the rooms. The first was a {{handsome}} sitting-room, with windows opening upon the rose gardens. Then came separate bedrooms for Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, with a fine bathroom between them. Aunt Em had a pretty dressing room, besides, and Dorothy opened the closets and showed several exquisite costumes that had been provided for her aunt by the royal dressmakers, who had worked all night to get them ready. Everything that Aunt Em could possibly need was in the drawers and closets, and her dressing-table was covered with engraved gold <b>toilet</b> <b>articles.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I grieve {{to say you}} {{are deeply}} mistaken--it is my very own," [...] he {{returned}} with great gravity. Nevertheless, he drew the coverlet close over his shoulder. But here he was again attracted by another face at the half-opened door--a freckled one, belonging to a boy apparently {{a year or two}} older than the girl. He was violently telegraphing to her to come away, although it was evident that he was at the same time deeply interested in the guest's <b>toilet</b> <b>articles.</b> Yet as his bright gray eyes and Mr. Hamlin's brown ones met, he succumbed, as the girl had, and walked directly to the bedside. But he did it bashfully--as the girl had not. He even attempted a defensive explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'UNDER WHAT NAME, unhappy boy--under what name?' screamed Mrs. Fitzsimons; and then, indeed, I {{remembered that}} I had signed the {{documents}} Barry Redmond instead of Redmond Barry: {{but what else}} could I do? Had not my mother desired me to take no other designation? After uttering a furious tirade against me, in which {{he spoke of the}} fatal discovery of my real name on my linen--of his misplaced confidence of affection, and the shame with which he should be obliged to meet his fashionable friends and confess that he had harboured a swindler, he gathered up the linen, clothes, silver <b>toilet</b> <b>articles,</b> and the rest of my gear, saying that he should step out that moment for an officer and give me up to the just revenge of the law.|$|E
60|$|Each officer {{carried in}} his pocket a tiny white tent. This, when placed upon the ground, quickly grew in size until it was large enough to permit the owner to enter it and sleep within its canvas walls. Files was obliged to carry a knapsack, in which was not only his own tent but an {{elaborate}} pavilion for Queen Ann, besides a bed and chair and a magic table. This table, when set upon the ground in Ann's pavilion, became of large size, and in a drawer of the table was contained the Queen's supply of extra clothing, her manicure and <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> and other necessary things. The royal bed {{was the only one}} in the camp, the officers and private sleeping in hammocks attached to their tent poles.|$|E
60|$|As he {{was coming}} in that evening he passed her in the hall. She was clad in {{what he called a}} bathrobe, and what she called an Arabian burnoose, of black {{embroidered}} with dull-gold crescents and stars, showing a V of exquisite flesh at her throat. A shred of tenuous lace straggled loose {{at the opening of the}} burnoose. Her radiant hair, tangled over her forehead, shone with a thousand various gleams from the gas-light over her head as she moved back against the wall and stood waiting for him to pass. She smiled very doubtfully, distantly--the smile, he felt, of a great lady from Mayfair. He bobbed his head, lowered his eyes abashedly, and noticed that along the shelf of her forearm, held against her waist, she bore many silver <b>toilet</b> <b>articles,</b> and such a huge heavy fringed Turkish bath-towel as he had never seen before.|$|E
6000|$|Bertha {{thought she}} had already rubbed {{the side of her}} {{wonderful}} lamp to a polish. But under the almost hypnotic spell of her West-Indian attendant she bought shoes, hats, hosiery, and <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> till her room looked [...] "like Christmas morning," [...] as Haney said, and yet there was little that could be called foolish or tawdry. She wore little jewelry, having resisted Haney's attempt to load her with rings and necklaces. Miss Franklin had impressed upon her the need of being [...] "simple." [...] When she put on her dinner-dress and faced him, Mart Haney was humbled to earth. [...] "Sure, ye're beautiful as an angel!" [...] he exulted, as if addressing a saint. And as she swept before the tall glass and saw her radiant self therein, she thought of Ben, and her face flamed with lovely color. [...] "I wish he could see me now!" [...] she inwardly exclaimed.|$|E
60|$|Afterwards {{it seemed}} to him that there must have been {{something}} mortally terrifying in his own appearance as he stood there with his back to the wall and his eyes fixed upon the solitary occupant of the room. Lady Letitia, in a blue dressing gown, was lying upon a couch drawn up before a small log fire. There seemed to be no detail of the room which in those sickening moments of mental absorption was not photographed into his memory. The old four-poster bedstead, hung with chintz; the long, black dressing table, once a dresser, covered carelessly with tortoise-shell backed <b>toilet</b> <b>articles,</b> with a large mirror in the centre from which a chair had just been pushed back. But, above all, that look in her face, from which every other expression seemed to have permanently fled. Her lips were parted, her eyes were round with horrified surprise. The book which she had been reading slipped from her fingers and fell noiselessly on to the hearth-rug. She sat up, supporting herself with her hands, one on either side, pressed into the sofa. She seemed denied the power of speech, almost as he was. And then a sudden wonderful change came to him. He spoke quite distinctly, although he kept his voice low.|$|E
60|$|She {{opened the}} gate, and raising her skirts with both hands, {{stepped into the}} plantation. Her small, white-shod feet fell noiselessly upon the thick undergrowth; she reached the {{entrance}} of the shelter without making any sound. Cautiously she peeped in. Her eyes grew round with surprise, her bosom began rapidly to rise and fall. It was Macheson who lay there, fast asleep! He had fallen asleep evidently whilst reading. A book was lying by his side, and a covered lantern was burning by his left shoulder. He was dressed in trousers and shirt; the latter was open at the throat, showing its outline firm and white, and his regular breathing. She drew a step nearer, and leaned over him. Curiously enough, in sleep the boyishness of his face was less apparent. The straight, firm mouth, rigidly closed, was the mouth of a man; his limbs, in repose, seemed heavy, even massive, especially the bare arm upon which his head was resting. His shirt was old, but spotlessly clean; his socks were neatly darned in many places. He occupied nearly the whole of the shelter, in fact one foot was protruding through the opening. In the corner a looking-glass was hanging from a stick, and a few simple <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> were spread upon the ground.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the marble}} {{of the bureau}} amidst a litter of <b>toilet</b> <b>articles,</b> and bought by Lise for a quarter at the Bagatelle bargain counter, was an oval {{photograph}} frame from which the silver wash had begun to rub off, and the band of purple velvet inside the metal had whitened. The frame always contained the current object of Lise's affections, though the exhibits--as Janet said--were subject to change without notice. The Adonis who now reigned had black hair cut in the prevailing Hampton fashion, very long in front and hanging down over his eyes like a Scottish terrier's; very long behind, too, but ending suddenly, shaved in a careful curve at the neck and around the ears. It had almost {{the appearance of a}} Japanese wig. The manly beauty of Mr. Max Wylie was of the lantern-jawed order, and in his photograph he conveyed the astonished and pained air of one who has been suddenly seized by an invisible officer of the law from behind. This effect, one presently perceived, was due to the high, stiff collar, the [...] "Torture Brand," [...] Janet called it, when she and her sister were engaged in one of their frequent controversies about life in general: the obvious retort to this remark, which Lise never failed to make, was that Janet could boast of no beaux at all.|$|E
60|$|Again {{condemned}} {{to wait in}} inactivity, Randolph tried to resist a certain uneasiness that was creeping over him, by attributing the captain's absence to some unexpected legal consultation or the gathering of evidence, his prolonged detention being due to the same fog that had delayed his own train. But he was somewhat {{surprised to find that}} the captain had ordered his luggage into the porter's care in the hall below before leaving, and that nothing remained in his room but a few <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> and the fateful portmanteau. The hours passed slowly. Owing to that perpetual twilight in which he had passed the day, there seemed no perceptible flight of time, and at eleven o'clock, the captain not arriving, he determined to wait in the latter's room so as to be sure not to miss him. Twelve o'clock boomed from an adjacent invisible steeple, but still he came not. Overcome by the fatigue and excitement of the day, Randolph concluded to lie down in his clothes on the captain's bed, not without a superstitious and uncomfortable recollection of that night, about a year before, when he had awaited him vainly at the San Francisco hotel. Even the fateful portmanteau was there to assist his gloomy fancy. Nevertheless, with the boom of one o'clock in his drowsy ears as his last coherent recollection, he sank into a dreamless sleep.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{magazine}} devoted to advertising {{she had read}} that Mr. S. Herbert Ross, whom she had known as advertising-manager of the Gas and Motor Gazette, had been appointed advertising-manager for Pemberton's--the greatest manufactory of drugs and <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> in the world. Una had just been informed by Mr. Wilkins that, while he had an almost paternal desire to see her successful financially and otherwise, he could never pay her more than fifteen dollars a week. He used a favorite phrase of commuting captains of commerce: [...] "Personally, I'd be glad to pay you more, but fifteen is all the position is worth." [...] She tried to persuade him {{that there is no}} position which cannot be made [...] "worth more." [...] He promised to [...] "think it over." [...] He was still taking a few months to think it over--while her Saturday pay-envelope remained as thin as ever--when Bessie Kraker resigned, to marry a mattress-renovator, and in Bessie's place Mr. Wilkins engaged a tall, beautiful blonde, who {{was too much of a}} lady to take orders from Una. This wrecked Una's little office home, and she was inspired to write to Mr. S. Herbert Ross at Pemberton's, telling him what a wise, good, noble, efficient man he was, and how much of a privilege it would be to become his secretary. She felt that Walter Babson must have been inexact in ever referring to Mr. Ross as [...] "Sherbet Souse." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{this purpose}} he {{projected}} a new raid on his town. He never meddled {{with any other}} town, for {{he was afraid to}} venture into houses whose ins and outs he did not know and the habits of whose households he was not acquainted with. He arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the Wednesday before the advent of the twins--after writing his Aunt Pratt that he would not arrive until two days after--and laying in hiding there with his mother until toward daylight Friday morning, when he went to his uncle's house and entered by the back way with his own key, and slipped up to his room where he could have the use of the mirror and <b>toilet</b> <b>articles.</b> He had a suit of girl's clothes with him in a bundle as a disguise for his raid, and was wearing a suit of his mother's clothing, with black gloves and veil. By dawn he was tricked out for his raid, but he caught a glimpse of Pudd'nhead Wilson through the window over the way, and knew that Pudd'nhead had caught a glimpse of him. So he entertained Wilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a while, then stepped out of sight and resumed the other disguise, and by and by went down and out the back way and started downtown to reconnoiter the scene of his intended labors.|$|E
60|$|There {{were still}} {{four hours of}} {{daylight}} after they had finished their meal, so they went out with Dias to explore one of the numerous burying- grounds round the village. It consisted of sunken chambers. In these were bones, with remains of the mats in which the bodies had been clothed. These wrappings resembled small sacks, and they remarked that the people must have been of very small size, or they could never have been packed away in them. With them had been buried many of the implements of their trade. One or two had apparently not been opened. Here were knitting utensils, <b>toilet</b> <b>articles,</b> implements for weaving, spools of thread, needles of bone and bronze. With {{the body of a}} girl had been placed a kind of work-box, containing the articles that she had used, and the mummy of a parrot, some beads, and fragments of an ornament of silver. Dias told them that all these tombs were made long before the coming of the Incas. He said that round the heads of the men and boys were wound the slings they had used in life, while a piece of cotton flock was wrapped round the heads of the women. Many of the graves communicated with each other by very narrow passages; the purpose of these was not clear, but probably they were made to enable the spirits of the dead to meet and hold communion with each other.|$|E
60|$|Above {{railroad}} {{yards and}} mean tenements in Long Island City, {{just across the}} East River from New York, the shining milky walls of Pemberton's bulk up like a castle overtowering a thatched village. It is magnificently the new-fashioned, scientific, efficient business institution.... Except, perhaps, in one tiny detail. King Pemberton and his princely sons {{do not believe in}} all this nonsense about profit-sharing, or a minimum wage, or an eight-hour day, or pensions, {{or any of the other}} fads by which dangerous persons like Mr. Ford, the motor manufacturer, encourage the lazier workmen to think that they have just as much right to rise to the top as the men who have had nerve and foresight. And indeed Mr. Pemberton may be sound. He says that he bases wages on the economic law of supply and demand, instead of on sentiment; and how shrewdly successful are he and his sons is indicated by the fact that Pemberton's is one of the largest sources of drugs and proprietary medicines in the world; the second largest manufactory of soda-fountain syrups; of rubber, celluloid, and leather goods of the kind seen in corner drug-stores; and the third largest manufactory of soaps and <b>toilet</b> <b>articles.</b> It has been calculated that ninety-three million women in all parts of the world have ruined their complexions, and, therefore, their souls, by Pemberton's creams and lotions for saving the same; and that nearly three-tenths of the alcohol consumed in prohibition counties is obtained in Pemberton's tonics and blood-builders and women's specifics, the last being regarded by large farmers with beards as especially tasty and stimulating. Mr. Pemberton is the Napoleon of patent medicine, and also the Napoleon of drugs used by physicians to cure the effects of patent medicine. He is the Shakespeare of ice-cream sodas, and the Edison of hot-water bags. He rules more than five thousand employees, and his name is glorious on cartons in drug-stores, from Sandy Hook to San Diego, and chemists' shops from Hong-Kong to the Scilly Isles. He is a modern Allah, and Mr. S. Herbert Ross is his prophet.|$|E
60|$|Though {{these efforts}} of mine brought me very little money, they {{attracted}} {{not a little}} attention, and I made friends. I was looked upon as a promising young writer and, I think I may say it without vanity, was accepted {{as a member of}} the intelligentsia, an honourable condition which, some years later, when I became a popular writer of light comedies, I lost; and have never since regained. I was invited to literary parties and to parties given by women of rank and fashion who thought it behoved them to patronise the arts. An unattached and fairly presentable young man is always in demand. I lunched out and dined out. Since I could not afford to take cabs, when I dined out, in tails and a white tie, as was then the custom, I went and came back by bus. I was asked to spend week-ends in the country. They were something of a trial on account of the tips you had to give to the butler and to the footman who brought you your morning tea. He unpacked your gladstone bag, and you were uneasily aware that your well-worn pyjamas and modest <b>toilet</b> <b>articles</b> had made an unfavourable impression upon him. For all that, I found life pleasant and I enjoyed myself. There seemed no reason why I should not go on indefinitely in the same way, bringing out a novel once a year (which seldom earned more than the small advance the publisher had given me but which was on the whole respectably reviewed), going to more and more parties, making more and more friends. It was all very nice, but I couldn't see that it was leading me anywhere. I was thirty. I was in a rut. I felt I must get out of it. It did not take me long to make up my mind. I told the friend with whom I shared the flat that I wanted to be rid of it and go abroad. He could not keep it by himself, but we luckily found a middle-aged gentleman who wished to install his mistress in it, and was prepared to take it off our hands. We sold the furniture for what it could fetch, and within a month I was on my way to Paris. I took a room in a cheap hotel on the Left Bank.|$|E
