40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE To {{verify the}} {{correlation}} between temperature measurements performed using an infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> and an esophageal thermometer during the intraoperative period. METHOD A longitudinal study of repeated measures was performed including subjects aged 18 years or older undergoing elective oncologic surgery of the digestive system, with anesthesia duration of at least 1 hour. Temperature measurements were performed simultaneously by a calibrated esophageal thermometer and by a calibrated infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer,</b> with laboratory reading precision of ± 0. 2 ºC. The operating room temperature remained between 19 and 21 ºC. RESULTS The study included 51 patients, mostly men (51 %), white (80. 4 %). All patients were kept warm by a forced-air heating system, {{for an average of}} 264. 14 minutes (SD = 87. 7). The two temperature measurements showed no different behavior over time (p = 0. 2205), however, tympanic measurements were consistently 1. 24 °C lower (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of the <b>tympanic</b> membrane <b>thermometer</b> for use with pregnant women. Design : Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting : A major medical center in the midwestern United States. Participants : Thirty-three hospitalized, afebrile pregnant women. Main outcome measures : <b>Tympanic</b> membrane <b>thermometers</b> and glass mercury thermometers were used to measure body temperature at the ear and rectum, respectively. The results were compared using two statistical methods: the Pearson correlation coefficient and a new technique suggested by Bland and Altman (1986). Results : Auditory canal temperature measured by a <b>tympanic</b> membrane <b>thermometer</b> correlated with rectal temperature as measured by a glass mercury thermometer (r = 0. 38, p = 0. 01). Thus, the <b>tympanic</b> membrane <b>thermometer</b> is acceptable for monitoring the body temperature of pregnant women. However, the device's estimation of rectal temperature is not clinically reliable.

40|$|Thhe newly {{available}} in-frared tympanic ther-mometer {{has become}} popular {{because it is}} easy to use, takes less time to measure tem-perature, and causes little discom-fort to the patient. The ear canal has a temperature gradient, warmest at the tympanic mem-brane and coolest at the auditory meatus. The tympanic membrane is situated close to the internal carotid artery, and its tempera-ture is thought to reflect the tem-perature of the blood flowing into the hypothalamus. The ear canal radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves in propor-tion to its temperature. Infrared thermometers detect this thermal radiation, which is in the far-in-frared range in the human body. ' The <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> is reported reliable and comparable to mercury thermometers. 2 - 5 However, <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> measurements (TTM) can be af-fected by several factors, such as whether the patient has been ly-ing on that ear, whether he or she has been exposed to cold or hot temperatures, and whether the in-frared thermometer is positioned closely enough to the tympanic membrane, which is not always possible, owing to small ear canal dimensions in younger children and standard tympanic ther-mometer tip size. 67 A patient's crying may also affect readings. When a child cries, the tympanic membrane becomes red, owing to increased blood flow to the area. Many times, this increased red-ness is extreme enough to give the clinician a false-positive sign of ear infection. A medical litera-ture search showed no studies de-scribing the effect of crying on <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> measure-ment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether in-creased blood flow to the tym-panic membrane with crying has any significant effect on the accu-racy of measurements taken by the <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer...</b>|$|E

The cell of a temperature calibrator was modified to serve as the standard temperature of the blackbody. The errors of measurement for the two meters were reduced by the calibration equation. The predictive values could meet the requirements of the ASTM standard. The sources of uncertainty include the standard deviations of replication at fixed temperature or the predicted values of calibration equation, reference standard values and resolution. The uncertainty analysis shows that the uncertainty of calibration equation is the main source for combined uncertainty.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Body {{temperature}} can {{be measured}} in seconds with <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometers</b> as opposed to minutes with mercury ones. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare tympanic and oral mercury thermometer measurements under high ambient field temperatures. RESULTS: Tympanic temperature (measured thrice by 3 operators) was compared to oral temperature measured once with a mercury-in-glass thermometer in 201 patients (aged ≥ 5 years), on the Thai-Myanmar border. Ambient temperature was measured with an electronic thermo-hygrometer. Participants had a mean [min-max] age of 27 [5 - 60] years and 42 % (84) were febrile by oral thermometer. The mean difference in the mercury and tympanic temperature measurement for all observers/devices was 0. 09 (95 %CI 0. 07 - 0. 12) °C and intra-class correlation for repeat tympanic measurements was high (≥ 0. 97) for each observer. Deviations in tympanic temperatures were not related to ambient temperature.

40|$|Abstract Background It is now {{common for}} parents to measure tympanic {{temperatures}} in children. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements. Methods Parents and then nurses measured the temperature of 60 children with a <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> designed for home use (home thermometer). The reference standard was a temperature measured by a nurse with a model of <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> commonly used in hospitals (hospital thermometer). A difference of ≥ 0. 5 °C was considered clinically significant. A fever was defined as a temperature ≥ 38. 5 °C. Results The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent and the nurse with the home thermometer was 0. 44 ± 0. 61 °C, and 33 % of the readings differed by ≥ 0. 5 °C. The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent with the home thermometer and the nurse with the hospital thermometer was 0. 51 ± 0. 63 °C, and 72 % of the readings differed by ≥ 0. 5 °C. Using the home thermometer, parents detected fever with a sensitivity of 76 % (95 % CI 50 – 93 %), a specificity of 95 % (95 % CI 84 – 99 %), a positive predictive value of 87 % (95 % CI 60 – 98 %), and a negative predictive value of 91 % (95 % CI 79 – 98 %). In comparing the readings the nurse obtained from the two different tympanic thermometers, the mean absolute difference was 0. 24 ± 0. 22 °C. Nurses detected fever with a sensitivity of 94 % (95 % CI 71 – 100 %), a specificity of 88 % (95 % CI 75 – 96 %), a positive predictive value of 76 % (95 % CI 53 – 92 %), and a negative predictive value of 97 % (95 %CI 87 – 100 %) using the home thermometer. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the three sets of readings was 0. 80, and the consistency of readings was not affected by the body temperature.

40|$|Background: Monitoring patients' {{temperatures}} is {{an important}} aspect of clinical nursing. Oral temperature readings have long been considered as a gold standard. However, oral temperature measurements may be contraindicated in some patients, that is cases with level of consciousness and seizure. Axiliary and tympanic temperature monitoring are often the next choices. We decided to evaluate these methods compared with standard oral temperature readings. Materials and Methods: Subjects were a convenient sample of 81 adult patients over 17 years old in Shahrood Imam Hussein hospital. The study time course spanned a 1 -mounth in December, 2004. Body temperature is measured in the evening using mercury oral and axiliary thermometers and 'Omeron' <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Results: From 81 patients studied, there were 35 (43. 2) males and 46 (56. 8) females and their mean age was 46. 0 Â± 19. 2 (range 17 - 85). The mean for oral temperature was 36. 9 Â± 0. 56 Â°C, axiliary: 36. 5 Â± 0. 53 Â°C, tympanic: 36. 5 Â± 0. 49 Â° C. Oral thermometry identified a fever in 8 of 81 (9. 9) patients. The ROC analysis for determining a cut point with 100 sensitivity is used. For axiliary measurement at 36. 95 Â°C, 82 specificity and for tympanic measurement at 36. 45 Â°C, 55 specificity is recorded. Alpha coronbach for reliability of <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> is equal to 0. 98. The correlation between right to right and left to right ear temperature were 0. 96 and 0. 94, respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that axiliary thermometer with carefully use and suitable cut point is an effective instrument. With regard to specificity of <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> for detection of fever, we do not recommend electronic tympanic measurement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tympanic {{thermometry}} {{has come}} as a suitable alternative to traditional thermometry because of its safety and ease of use. However, it is still yet to gain wide acceptance in African settings due to conflicting results on its accuracy, thus rectal thermometry remains the gold standard in the newborn. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare tympanic and rectal temperatures in term Nigerian neonates. Methods Rectal and tympanic temperatures were measured simultaneously in 300 consecutive term neonates between the ages of 37 and 42 [*]weeks gestation using mercury-in-glass and the Infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometers</b> respectively. Paired t test, Pearson correlation coefficient and the Bland-Altman plot were used to compute data. Using rectal thermometry as gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of tympanic thermometry at various rectal temperature cut-offs were determined. Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) were constructed and the Areas Under the Curves (AUC) were compared. Results The mean rectal temperature (37. 34 [*]±[*] 0. 55 °C) was significantly higher than the mean tympanic temperature (37. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 56 °C) (p[*] Conclusions The sensitivity of tympanic thermometry was relatively low in detecting rectal temperatures despite the good correlation and agreement between them. The specificities and predictive values of tympanic temperatures in detecting rectal temperatures were high and accuracy increased with higher temperatures. Though using the tympanic route for measuring temperature in the newborn is relatively safe and non-invasive, its low sensitivity limits its use. Further studies would be required to further assess the accuracy of tympanic temperature measurements in the newborn. </p...|$|R

Recently developed infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometers</b> offer rapid readings, but their accuracy has not been established. We studied two infrared thermometers (FirstTemp @ and Thermoscan@) and a thermistor (IVAC&reg;) in children with cancer. Mean infrared measurements did not differ significantly between right and left ear canals, and the mean IVAC&reg; temperature did not differ significantly from the left to the right axilla (P> 0. 05, paired t test). IVAC&reg; predictive mode mean temperature was 0. 2 &deg;C lower than monitor mode mean temperature in the axilla (P < 0. 0001), but 0. 1 &deg;C higher than monitor mode orally (P < 0. 0001). Aiming the infrared instrument at the tympanic membrane using an ear tug resulted in a 0. 2 &deg;C higher mean temperature than casual placement in the ear canal (P < 0. 0001). After compensation for the mean difference in reference oral glass-mercury versus test instrument temperatures, the FirstTemp&reg;, Thermoscan&reg;, and oral and axillary predictive mode IVAC&reg; measurements yielded sensitivities for the detection of fever of 84 %, 84 %, 82 %, and 86 %; specificities of 100 %, 99 %, 100 %, and 100 %; positive predictive values of 100 %, 93 %, 100 %, and 100 %; and negative predictive values of 95 %, 98 %, 98 %, and 98 %, respectively.

Ten well-trained subjects completed four exercise trials consisting of 40 min constant-load exercise at 63 % of maximum work rate followed by a 16. 1 km time trial at 30 °C and 70 % relative humidity. Temperature at rest was not different between the three methods of Tc measurement (Tre: 37. 2 ± 0. 3 °C; Tp: 37. 2 ± 0. 2 °C; Tty: 37. 1 ± 0. 3 °C; P= 0. 40). Temperature rose continuously during the exercise period (ΔTre: 2. 2 ± 0. 5 °C; ΔTp: 2. 2 ± 0. 5 °C; ΔTty: 1. 9 ± 0. 5 ±°C {{and there were no}} differences between Tre and Tp measurements at any time throughout exercise (P= 0. 32).

40|$|Background and objectives: The {{consequences}} of missing fever in {{children can be}} grave. Body temperature is commonly recorded at the axilla but accuracy is a problem. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> in the paediatric emergency setting. Method: In a total of 106 infants, the body temperature was measured in the daytime with an infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and at the axilla with an electronic thermometer and at the rectum (gold standard for measurement of body temperature). Fever {{was defined as a}} rectal temperature of 38. 0 C ̊ or greater, axillary temperature of 37. 5 C ̊ or greater, and tympanic temperature of 37. 6 C ̊ or greater. The temperature readings at the three sites were compared statistically. Results: There was a greater correlation of the tympanic measurement with the rectal measurement than the axillary with the rectal in both febrile and afebrile infants.

This report provides details of a project to develop a functional and reliable tympanic thermal simulator prototype that could be embedded into the ear of a manikin to enable <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometers</b> to be used during simulation encounters. Methods: A simple electrical circuit was built using (i) a standard 9 -V battery, (ii) a switch, (iii) 5 × 62 -Ω resistors in parallel for circuit stability, (iv) a 62 -Ω resistor in parallel with (v) a 1 -kΩ potentiometer to vary the infrared light-emitting diode (IRLED) intensity, and (vi) 2 IRLEDs. After confirming reliability of circuit performance, the IRLEDs were implanted into the ear of a manikin. Over 3 consecutive days, 3033 samples were recorded simulating a range of human body temperatures, controlled by altering current flow. Results: Initial testing of the thermal simulator prototype indicates that a range of human temperatures (34. 0 °C– 41. 9 °C) can be generated using high-intensity IRLEDs. Although, at higher applied current levels, the variation in measured temperature was larger (2. 4 °C) than at lower applied currents (0. 2 °C), reasonably precise temperatures were achieved. Conclusions: Testing and reporting initial prototype results are {{an important first step}} in developing and refining a useful product to enhance manikin capabilities associated with patient physical assessment in the simulation setting. Despite the undesired variation, the current design could still be used for teaching purposes in educational settings. Retrieving tympanic temperatures during “patient assessment” of the simulator benefits nursing, midwifery, and other health care students by enabling authentic practice. Further development of this prototype is required to improve the reliability, precision, and accuracy of the device.

40|$|AbstractStudy ObjectiveIncidence of {{inadvertent}} perioperative hypothermia {{is still}} high; therefore, present guidelines advocate “prewarming” for its prevention. Prewarming means preoperative patient skin warming, which minimizes redistribution hypothermia caused by induction of anesthesia. In this study, {{we compared the}} new self-warming BARRIER EasyWarm blanket with passive thermal insulation regarding mean perioperative patient core body temperature. DesignMultinational, multicenter randomized prospective open-label controlled trial. SettingSurgical ward, operation room, postanesthesia care unit at 4 European hospitals. PatientsA total of 246 adult patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists class I to III undergoing elective orthopedic; gynecologic; or ear, nose, and throat surgery scheduled for 30 to 120 minutes under general anesthesia. InterventionsPatients received warmed hospital cotton blankets (passive thermal insulation, control group) or BARRIER EasyWarm blanket at least 30 minutes before induction of general anesthesia and throughout the perioperative period (intervention group). MeasurementsThe primary efficacy outcome was the perioperative mean core body temperature measured by a <b>tympanic</b> infrared <b>thermometer.</b> Secondary outcomes were hypothermia incidence, change in core body temperature, length of stay in postanesthesia care unit, thermal comfort, patient satisfaction, ease of use, and adverse events related to the BARRIER EasyWarm blanket. Main ResultsThe BARRIER EasyWarm blanket significantly improved perioperative core body temperature compared with standard hospital blankets (36. 5 °C, SD 0. 4 °C, vs 36. 3, SD 0. 3 °C; P<. 001).

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of these {{series of experiments}} was to develop an optimal hyperhydration strategy for use during conditions of restricted water access or exercise-induced heat stress. This strategy was composed of two compounds, namely Cr and Gly which each targeted specific body water compartments in order to maximise the volume of retained water. Endurance-trained subjects were recruited {{to participate in the}} current series of three experiments, and following Cr/Gly supplementation, body water was estimated by multifrequency bioimpedance and the physiological responses to exercise in the heat (30 °C, 70 % relative humidity) recorded and compared to pre-supplementation values. The aim of the first study presented in this thesis (Chapter 3 (a)) was {{to examine the effects of}} combined Cr and Gly supplementation on fluid retention and subsequently the effects on cardiovascular, thermoregulatory and metabolic responses and performance during exercise in the heat. The aim of Chapter 3 (b) was to examine the effects of a novel method of Cr and Gly delivery and ingestion on fluid retention and distribution. Chapter 4 (a) aimed to assess the effects of Cr and Gly supplementation ingested according to the loading protocol described in the previous chapter (6 days of Cr and Gly ingestion, with the final supplement consumed 3 hours prior to measurement) on cardiovascular, thermoregulatory and metabolic responses and performance during exercise in the heat. The aim of the study in Chapter 4 (b) was to examine the effects of extending the period of time between ingestion of the final Cr/Gly supplement on the retention and distribution of fluid. The experiment in chapter 5 compared the effects of the novel Cr and Gly loading protocol established in Chapter 4 (b) on cardiovascular, thermoregulatory and metabolic responses and performance during exercise in the heat.

A total of 220 pair ears, axillaries, and rectal sites were used to determine the body temperature in patients aged between 3 months to 6 years who referred to Emergency Department of Fateme Zahra Hospital affiliated to Bushehr University of Medical Sciences. Rectal temperature (RT) was considered as gold standard. Fe-ver was defined as RT 38 oC, axillary temperature (AT) 37. 2 oC and tympanic temperature (TT) 38 oC. Correlation between rectal and tympanic temperature was statistically sig-nificant. The mean difference between RT and TT was 0. 3 oC and between RT and AT was 0. 1 oC. When cutoff point was considered 38 oC for TT, the sensitivity was 46 %, specificity was 97 % and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 92 % and 72 % respectively. ROC curve showed the best cutoff point for TT as 37 oC, which increased the sensitivity to 92 % and PPV to 0. 98 but de-creased the specificity to 90 % and NPV to 0. 57. Kappa test showed a good agreement rate between RT and TT. Age had significant effects on the TT/RT relationship. If the cut off point for TT is set at 38 oC the sensitivity and NPV will be unaccepta-bly low and a number of children with fever may be missed by screening with a <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer.</b> If the cutoff point is 37 oC, the sensitivity and NPV will improve and TT can be used as a safe, easy, rapid, and accurate method in pediatrics...|$|E
40|$|Background: Measuring {{temperature}} {{is an essential}} part of nursing care. It has been widely accepted as an indication of a patients' clinical condition. Often this enables early intervention and/or treatment as a change in body temperature can indicate the presence of infection or disorders of the thermoregulatory system. Objective: The purpose to this study was to investigate agreement between the BD digital thermometer, the Genius 2 ™ <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> and the SureTemp® Plus 692 thermometer. Method: A comparative design was used to evaluate the level of agreement between each thermometer in preterm and term infants, ranging from 24 weeks gestation to post term. Results: A total of 238 infants were enrolled in the study, 52 infants with less than 28 weeks gestation, 112 with 29 – 36 weeks, 69 infants with more than 36 weeks. In general, BD digital and SureTemp® Plus 692 measurements were in closer agreement than the BD digital and the Genius 2 ™ <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The mean difference between the BD digital and the SureTemp® Plus 692 measurements was − 0. 185 (± 2 SD: − 0. 561 to 0. 91). The mean difference between the BD digital and Genius 2 ™ was − 0. 368 (± 2 SD: − 1. 078 to 0. 342).

The inequality between the rectal and tympanic temperatures can be due to anatomical and physiological characteristics of those body regions. Despite the highest cost of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer,</b> it seems more advantageous in relation to the traditional clinical thermometer, due the fast and practical application in the clinical checking of cats.  KEY WORDS: Felis catus, rectal temperature, thermometer, tympanic temperature. O termômetro timpânico veterinário de raios infravermelhos é uma alternativa prática para a mensuração da temperatura corporal, mas pouco tem sido explorado para verificar sua equivalência com a temperatura retal utilizando-se um termômetro clínico de haste. Compararam-se a temperatura timpânica e a temperatura retal em 41 gatos normotérmicos. Dados da temperatura e da umidade do ambiente foram coletados para pareamento com os dados térmicos dos animais. A temperatura retal foi mais elevada que as temperaturas timpânicas de ambos os ouvidos, que por sua vez não diferiram. Não houve correlação entre as temperaturas corporais mensuradas, e fatores microclimáticos parecem não estar associados à variação da temperatura retal ou timpânica. A não equivalência entre as temperaturas das membranas timpânicas e do reto pode ser devida às características anatômicas e fisiológicas dessas regiões corporais. Apesar do custo mais elevado, o termômetro timpânico parece ser mais vantajoso na clínica com gatos domésticos, por ser mais prático e mais rápido.

40|$|Introduction The {{consequences}} {{of failing to}} notice fever in children can be serious. On the other hand, false positive reading can result in unnecessary investigation or diagnostic approach. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare different ways of body temperature measurement. Material and methods This prospective study was carried out on Pediatric Department of General Hospital in Subotica during 10 months (March-December 2006). In 263 children aged 1 month to 18 years of age, the body temperature was obtained from 4 measurement sites: tactile assessment, forehead and ear by electronic thermometer, rectal temperature in small children (up to 2 years of age) or axillar temperature in older children by mercury <b>thermometer.</b> <b>Tympanic</b> thermometry was considered as a standard for fever detection. Results The sensitivity of rectal temperature to detect fever is 46. 67 %, while specificity is 92. 19 %. The sensitivity of fever detection by electronic thermometry on the forehead is lower according to rectal thermometry - 36. 08 %, while specificity is 95. 18 %. The lowest values of sensitivity are recorded in axillar thermometry (35. 82 %), specificity is 90. 20 %. The correlation coefficient is higher between tympanic and rectal temperature measurement (r= 0. 5076, p< 0. 0005), than between tympanic and forehead measurements (r= 0. 5076, p< 0, 0005), while the lowest was between tympanic and axillar measurement sites (r= 0. 4933, p< 0. 0005). Conclusions The results of our study and literature data show that the most accurate methods of thermometry are rectal measurement of body temperature in small children and tympanic thermometry in children over 2 years of age...|$|R

The profile of these women “at risk” suggests that they are 1) normally at their first birth, 2) usually very young with 3) a great residual reproductive potential and (4) immigrated from another country. Conclusion The results here presented might have important implications in therapeutic assessment, as the identification of risk factors, to offer and promote adequate socio-psychological support to at risk future mothers. Evaluation of tympanic and rectal temperature measurements to estimate {{the time of death}} in accidents in cold water Introduction and aims The reliable measurement of core deep body temperature is fundamental to estimate the time of death (TOD) in Hessnge nomogram. The golden standard is measuring through rectal or oesophagus probe. Recently infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometers</b> (ITT), have substituted in some cases the golden standard. We assisted, as defense consultants, a case of suspect maternal infanticide, where the emergency service revealed a deep temperature of 24. 9 ° C with ITT on a female victim of 2 years old, immersed in a 18 ° C river. The ITT estimated time of death, which seemed to be the only strong evidence against the mother, was in contrast with the predictions from most other biological and thanatological evidences (bloodgas analysis and myocardium electric activity). I could ascertain that according to the psycho-biological profile, the mother had no motive to kill her daughter. To validate the TOD evidence, this work aimed to provide a reliable correlation between the golden standard and infrared tympanic temperature to be eventually used in this and future cases of TOD measurements in accidents occurring in cold water. Methods To compare the ITT and the rectal probe temperature measurements, we tested laboratory rats, in three different conditions: dry alive, immersed alive in 18 C° water, and immersed dead (by cervical dislocation) in 18 °C water. To sample infrared temperature, we used 3 infrared thermometers. Genius 3000 A (used in this forensic case, 2 samples) and Genius 2 (the most popular at present in Italian emergency services). The rectal temperature was assessed using a rectal probe connected to a monitor Propaq. We also tested the accuracy of ITT, recording body temperatures on a human volunteer before during and after exposing its right ear to 3 minutes running water at 18 °C and subsequently dried. Results The Genius 2 stopped registering at 33 °C and never resumed recording following the first measurement after the rat was submersed in water. This observation was a posteriori confirmed in the user manual, which stated that this thermometer stopped reading below 33 °C. When the rats were submerged in the 18 °C running water, the rectal temperature began to decline steadily. The tympanic temperature recorded with Genius 3000 A, in contrast, dropped sharply from 34 °C to 24 °C after the rats were submerged alive in the water. After their deaths, the rectal temperatures continued to decline steadily without major variations, while the tympanic temperature fluctuated above water temperature. On the human volunteer ITT measures immediately fell under 19 C°, while the whole body temperature, remained unchanged at 36. 5 C°. ITT measurements recovered the subject correct body temperature after 33 minutes from water exposure. Conclusion In water-related accidents, such as near drowning, infrared ear thermometry is not a suitable method to measure the actual deep body temperature. Further, confirming these results, the temperature readings of the ITT device provide unreliable measurements of the core temperature. This inaccuracy could lead to inappropriate medical decisions, and thus, we suggest ITT measurements should not be utilised for such cases. Moreover, the use of the ITT Genius 2 is not recommended in emergency settings, especially in case of hypothermia due to his its incapacity to register under 33 C°. Errors, Guidelines and Remarks: what happens in the practice? Introduction and aims The results of previous study left a lot of unanswered questions. The bulk of knowledge necessary to diagnosis of the time of death, known as thanatology, is a multidisciplinary field of study, that includes forensic pathology to biology, through chemistry, physics and also forensic entomology., Assessing the victims time of death is a crucial point in forensic practice: it allows investigators to clarify the last hours alive of the victims, it also helps to point out the causes of death and, moreover, it’s crucial to substantiate suspicious alibis. Nevertheless, before becoming a crime scene, the environment and setting where a body is found, is a place where someone need to be rescued and treated by medical assistance, and this interferes with thanatological requirements. Here we aim to analyze what happens in the forensic and medico-legal practice in our country. Methods We have analyzed the European guidelines for resuscitation in wild conditions as hypothermia and drowning in cold water, with a focus on what are the suggestions for estimating the core temperature, both for the resuscitation procedure and the estimation of the time of death. Then we took in consideration what happens in Italian emergency services and which procedures, if any, they implement in the described conditions. Those data were found on the Hospital’s websites, in our Country. Finally, we have examined some relevant cases, taken from the analysis of specialized books and from the archives of major newspapers that have followed the penal processes reported, where the investigation of the crime scene and the estimation of the time of death were decisive to solve the crime. Results The European guidelines for resuscitation are very precise concerning the treatment for a patient affected by injuries due to hypothermia or drowning. But they are not that specific for what concern the use of a particular method to register the core temperature. In the forensic practice the methodology to estimate the TOD is heterogeneous. In Italy, the guidelines to resuscitation are provided just at local level, and it’s not even mandatory to have a temperature recording device on the ambulance. Conclusion We found out that procedural mistakes and lack of univocal rules in the practice have led to controversial outcomes in legal processes. Our work urges further studies regarding the techniques to estimate the post- mortem period, and suggests an adequate training for the rescue teams members, to provide the best care and to preserve such important evidence as TOD. General Conclusions In this thesis I’ve explored the applications of evolutionary psychology in the forensic practice, outlining the role of the investigative psychologist. The research outcomes might have both theoretical and practical implications. First, It has been described {{for the first time the}} sexual presence, which is a phenomena which might be involved in the assessment of paraphilias and violent behavior with virtual reality. Second, it has been found that maternal neonaticide, in our species, has an evolutionary cause, and the neonaticidal woman profile is different from infanticidal and filicide ones. These suggestions have relevant effects in the investigation phase, in correctional assessment, and also in the definitions of preventive measurement targeted to at-risk future mothers. Third, collaborating as consultant in a case of suspect infanticide, I found that the tympanic temperature, very used in the practice, is not a valuable measure to assess the time of death in extreme outdoor conditions, where the body core temperature is essential. In light of these results, it has been noticed the lack of regulations in our country about the estimating of TOD, and I provide suggestions to improve medico –legal and resuscitation actions in the forensic practice. These studies show the versatility and the practical value of evolutionary psychology in the forensic domain. In fact, the most important outcome of this work is to demonstrate how the techniques and theories learned and explored during three PhDs years, have important applications in the clinical, criminological and forensic practice, and how it could be important to carry on researches in evolutionary forensic psychology, due to its social implications. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{accuracy}} and reliability of temperature measuring devices in thermal physi-ology research and clinical practice has been subject of various investigations. Research data have been conflicting in some cases. Further investigations are therefore needed to elucidate the reliability and sensitivity of these devices under different temperature settings. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the tympanic thermistor (TT), infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> (ITT) and oral thermistor (OT) in the detection of body temperature changes in adults exposed to heat load. A single set of three simultaneous temperatures i. e. oral, left and right tympanic membrane were measured. At rest, core with OT and ITT. This showed that when subjects were exposed to heat load, there was no difference in Tc measured by TT and ITT, although both were significantly higher than that measured with OT. From these results, it might be thought that the sensitivity for Tc detection increased in the order tympanic thermistor>infrared thermometer>oral thermis-tor...|$|E

This study was {{designed}} to determine if temperature readings using a new <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> are affected by otitis media. These readings were also compared to a rectal or oral temperature. Eighty-four children with unilateral suppurative or non-suppurative otitis media diagnosed clinically by their pediatricians were enrolled in the study. Temperatures were measured in both ears using the Thermoscan PRO- 1 Instant Thermometer and rectally or orally by a glass or electronic predictive thermometer. For 67 children with unilateral suppurative otitis media the mean temperature in infected ears was 0. 38 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in uninfected ears (p=. 005). Neither temperatures measured in affected nor those from unaffected ears differed significantly from oral or rectal control readings. For 17 children with unilateral non-suppurative otitis media there was no statistically significant difference between temperatures in affected and unaffected ears or between the temperatures in either ear and the oral or rectal control. Our data show that temperatures taken in ears with suppurative otitis media are slightly higher than those in normal ears.

40|$|Background: Body {{temperature}} {{is a measure}} of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. For recording of body temperature several different types of thermometers are available, such as mercury thermometers, digital thermometer, liquid crystal forehead thermometer, and infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> are used. The accuracy of the device is to record and grade {{temperature is}} uncertain. Objective: The study was carried out the recordings of normal body temperature using liquid crystal forehead thermometer and compare with gold standard oral mercury thermometer. Methodology: Simultaneous recording were made using the two devise in randomly enrolled 150 apparently healthy medical student eighteen (18) to twenty (20) years age of either sex. Written & verbal consent was taken from the students without any coercion. Oral-temperature was recorded with Chinese made mercury thermometer and the forehead temperature was recorded using liquid crystal (Boots, UK) thermometer. Results: No statistical significant difference existed between the recordings of two devices. The mean difference was 0. 8 degree. Liquid crystal forehead thermometer recorded higher temperatures. Both the devices recorded temperature within normal range. Conclusions: Sensitivity of liquid-crystal thermometer to detect body temperature is comparable with that of mercury thermometer. It is a good device for home use but health providers should not use it. Mercur...|$|E

Childhood hearing impairment is a world-wide problem which continues to have an high prevalence in newborns. Among the mechanisms of diseases, obese children often have asthma and high hepcidin levels that may reduce serum iron concentrations.

Infrared <b>tympanic</b> <b>thermometer</b> (IRTT) in oral mode for the measurement of body temperature may be useful in fever screening in a busy setup. In newborns, the transmission of CMV infection through breast milk may be prevented through freezing or pasteurization. Recent advances in treatment of constipation, urinary tract infections, leukemia, pain in children with cancer, neonates with sepsis or difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation will likely contribute towards optimizing management of these common disorders.
