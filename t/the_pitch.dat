5|$|The goal of tuning a {{pipe organ}} is to adjust <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> of each pipe {{so that they}} all sound in tune with each other. How <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> of each pipe is {{adjusted}} depends on the type and construction of that pipe.|$|E
5|$|Each half of <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> is then divided {{again by}} a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags at the side of <b>the</b> <b>pitch.</b> In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of <b>the</b> <b>pitch.</b> Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the back line (this replaced long corners).|$|E

Sigfried Held passed to Lothar Emmerich on the left hand side of <b>the</b> <b>pitch,</b> Emmerich played a lofted pass to Held, who volleyed the ball into the goal to give Dortmund a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later Liverpool were level. Peter Thompson ran down the left hand side of <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> and passed to Roger Hunt who scored to level the match at 1–1. The linesman on the left hand side of <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> signalled to the referee that the ball had gone out of play, yet the referee ignored him and allowed the goal to stand. There were few chances for either side {{until the end of the}} half when Liverpool had a chance to win the match, but Hunt's shot missed.

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off <b>the</b> <b>pitch,</b> deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E
5|$|Stricklett {{learned the}} spitball from minor league {{teammate}} George Hildebrand in 1902, who {{learned about it}} from Frank Corridon.

5|$|The {{conditions}} {{were so bad}} that when Liverpool coach Bob Paisley came onto <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> to attend to an injured player, Shankly entered as well.

Ajax extended their lead in the 39th minute. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith fouled Cruyff outside the Liverpool penalty area. The subsequent free-kick taken by Frits Soetekouw was not cleared by the Liverpool defence and the ball rebounded to Nuninga, who scored to give Ajax a 3–0 lead. The conditions did not only affect the Liverpool players. Towards {{the end of the}} first half, the referee blew his whistle. Swart, assuming that he had signalled half-time began to walk off <b>the</b> <b>pitch,</b> was stopped by a steward who pointed out that the match was still ongoing.
