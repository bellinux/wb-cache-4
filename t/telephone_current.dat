40|$|Internet Telephony {{has been}} deemed as a {{promising}} {{candidate for the}} next generation telephone system. However, unstable voice quality is the main problem that prevents the Internet Telephone from competing with the traditional circuit switched <b>telephone.</b> <b>Current</b> Internet supports only a best-effort service class, which does not provide any bandwidth or delay guarantee for the voice packets. During congestion, consecutive packets get lost or miss the deadlines, which results in severe degradation in voice quality. In this paper, we introduce the concept of using differentiated service model to solve the problem. First, we propose a class-based model to separate the voice streams from the best-effort traffic. Then we use a selective dropping model to further prevent consecutive packet losses to satisfy the (m, k) firm guarantee [9] requirement, and thereby enhance the voice quality in the Internet telephony services. The model is implemented using the ns simulator [18]. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated through the simulator and the results justify the validity of using the model for Internet telephony. Key Words...|$|E

40|$|Citation: Clark, Roy H. Underground {{telephone}} cables. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: For {{many years}} after {{the introduction of the}} telephone the difficulties of working through underground wires seemed almost insurmountable. The electrostatic capacity of the underground wires of early days was so much greater than that of overhead circuits as to materially interfere with telephonic transmission. In late years however, the methods of insulation have been so much improved that the underground construction of telephone circuits is the general rule in large cities, and is rapidly being adopted even in small towns. The standard type of cable for telephone work contains two hundred pairs of insulated wires. One hundred pairs and fifty pairs and various smaller numbers are used for distribution. The insulation of cables is now mostly of dry paper. The requisite number of pairs of wires to form the desired cable is taken, and each wire insulated from its mate by a loose wrapping of well dried paper. It is usual to color in some manner the individual wires after they are wrapped, in order that the component of each pair may be known without testing. The wires to be wrapped are simply separated by a sheet of paper, and then lightly twisted together, the twist being sufficient to hold both conductors and insulation in their proper relative positions. A single twisted pair of wires is taken to form the core of the completed cable and around that the required number of pairs are assembled in regular layers, each successive layer being wound about the preceding one with a reverse twist, making a complete turn in from eighteen to thirty-six inches. The use of paper gives an insulator of low electrostatic capacity yet strong enough to maintain an insulation of many thousand meg ohms against the weak electro-motive force of <b>telephone</b> <b>currents.</b> By twisting the several pairs of wires very loosely about each other a considerable volume filled with air remains. Capacity is decreased by leaving as much space between conductors as possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Emerging {{communication}} {{technologies have}} had an impact on population-based telephone surveys worldwide. Our objective was to examine the potential biases of health estimates in South Australia, a state of Australia, obtained via <b>current</b> landline <b>telephone</b> survey methodologies and to report on the impact of mobile-only household on household surveys. Methods Data from an annual multi-stage, systematic, clustered area, face-to-face population survey, Health Omnibus Survey (approximately 3000 interviews annually), included questions about telephone ownership to assess the population that were non-contactable by <b>current</b> <b>telephone</b> sampling methods (2006 to 2013). Univariable analyses (2010 to 2013) and trend analyses were conducted for sociodemographic and health indicator variables in relation to telephone status. Relative coverage biases (RCB) of two hypothetical telephone samples was undertaken by examining the prevalence estimates of health status and health risk behaviours (2010 to 2013) : directory-listed numbers, consisting mainly of landline telephone numbers and a small proportion of mobile telephone numbers; and a random digit dialling (RDD) sample of landline telephone numbers which excludes mobile-only households. Results Telephone (landline and mobile) coverage in South Australia is very high (97  %). Mobile telephone ownership increased slightly (7. 4  %), rising from 89. 7  % in 2006 to 96. 3  % in 2013; mobile-only households increased by 431  % over the eight year period from 5. 2  % in 2006 to 27. 6  % in 2013. Only half of the households have either a mobile or landline number listed in the telephone directory. There were small differences in the prevalence estimates for current asthma, arthritis, diabetes and obesity between the hypothetical telephone samples and the overall sample. However, prevalence estimate for diabetes was slightly underestimated (RCB value of − 0. 077) in 2013. Mixed RCB results were found for having a mental health condition for both <b>telephone</b> samples. <b>Current</b> smoking prevalence was lower for both hypothetical telephone samples in absolute differences and RCB values: − 0. 136 to − 0. 191 for RDD landline samples and − 0. 129 to − 0. 313 for directory-listed samples. Conclusion These findings suggest landline-based sampling frames used in Australia, when appropriately weighted, produce reliable representative estimates for some health indicators but not for all.
