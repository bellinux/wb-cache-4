5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} Schengen Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech as an extension of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} starting position {{and there is}} an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. This can only be done on the very next move, otherwise <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so is forfeit. For example, in the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 can take it via en passant on g6 (but only on White's next move).|$|E

5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Æthelheard died in 805 and was {{succeeded by}} Wulfred. Wulfred was given freedom to mint coins {{that did not}} name Coenwulf on the reverse, {{probably}} indicating that Wulfred was on good terms with the Mercian king. In 808 there was evidently a rift of some kind: a letter from Pope Leo to Charlemagne mentioned that Coenwulf had not yet made peace with Wulfred. After this no further discord is mentioned until 816, when Wulfred presided over a council which attacked lay control of religious houses. The council, held at Chelsea, asserted that Coenwulf {{did not have the}} right to make appointments to nunneries and monasteries, although both Leo and his predecessor, Pope Hadrian I, had granted Offa and Coenwulf <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Coenwulf had recently appointed his daughter, Cwoenthryth, to the position of abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. Leo died in 816, and his successor, Stephen IV, died the following January; the new pope, Paschal I confirmed Coenwulf's privileges but this did not end the dispute. In 817 Wulfred witnessed two charters in which Coenwulf granted land to Deneberht, bishop of Worcester, but there is no further record of Wulfred acting as archbishop for the rest of Coenwulf's reign. One account records that the quarrel between Wulfred and Coenwulf led to Wulfred being deprived of his office for six years, with no baptisms taking place during that time, but this may have been an exaggeration, with four years being the more likely term of the suspension.|$|E
