A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{insights}} into how ASEAN (The Association of Southeast Asian Nations) can tackle global issues of terrorism within the international system. The {{global war on}} <b>terrorism,</b> <b>to</b> a certain degree, has influenced the ASEAN leaders <b>to</b> securitize <b>terrorism</b> as a critical threat to ASEAN. However, in contrast to some other state which fight terrorism directly by using military forces, ASEAN take a more comprehensive policy by securitizing that issue {{in the context of}} transnational security threats that have threatened ASEAN for some time. The securitization has been done through speech-acts and some actions as part of ASEAN efforts to face transnational security threats. Among policies that have been enunciated include: (a) a common declaration <b>to</b> condemn <b>terrorism</b> and <b>to</b> work together <b>to</b> combat <b>terrorism</b> in November 2001; (b) the ASEAN bodies; and (c) several agreements in combating-terrorism, transnational crime or non-traditional security issues made with some countries such as the United States of America and Australia. By using these strategies, are more promising than those taken by some other state that attempt directly <b>to</b> combat <b>terrorism</b> by using military pressures. This paper also suggests that, one important issue that ASEAN should resolve in the context of its comprehensive security strategy is to synchronize their legal approaches <b>to</b> combat <b>terrorism</b> that can make policy coordination <b>to</b> fight <b>terrorism</b> easier <b>to</b> conduct...|$|R
