40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{to analyze the}} closing gap between regulation and enforcement of environmental protection in China and present a number of resulting implications for doing business there. We identify three major dimensions that characterize change in regulatory systems generally: priorities and incentives, bureaucratic alignment, and <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Using these dimensions, we first unpack the mechanisms that characterized China's prior period, during which enforcement of environmental protection was decoupled from regulation. These mechanisms include (a) the intense emphasis on economic growth leading to misaligned incentives and regulatory competition across regions, (b) fragmented bureaucratic organization, and (c) lack of <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring,</b> all of which undermined enforcement. Then we show how, {{in each of these}} dimensions, regulation and enforcement are becoming realigned or recoupled over time. We show how this results from (a) a change in national development strategy to focus more on sustainable development and a harmonious society, (b) reorganization of the bureaucracy, and (c) an increase in monitoring by both the government and the general public. Correspondingly, we advance managerial implications that stem from these recent changes, illustrated by recent MNC and Chinese domestic firm successes. To address changes in policies and incentives, firms should align with governmental signals and embrace environmental innovation. Regarding bureaucratic alignment, firms should avoid regulatory shopping and integrate local and global standards. Finally, to address <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> issues, firms should be transparent and compete on reputation. We conclude with a more general discussion of the contributions of our framework to understanding managerial practice in emerging-market regulatory contexts...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to cover the gap in {{literature}} about transparency in the context of international trade facilitation. It focuses on the importance of transparency in achieving growth in international trade and the differences between non-transparent practices and corruption in global trade. Managing the disclosure of information about rules, regulations and laws is not the only trade policy instrument where transparency becomes important. To build a framework on levels of transparency we developed a matrix classifying the transparency of each country based on ease of doing business and levels of bribery. Four different strategies are explained based on the different scenarios of transparency in international trade. The main conclusions reflect that disclosure of information is not enough to guarantee <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of transparency must be improved...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of developing countries, the recent agreement reached at the 10 th WTO Ministerial at Nairobi related to export competition, including exports subsidies, food aid, export credits and guarantees, and state trading enterprises (STEs). The legal and economic aspects of the agreement are examined, and the relevance of banning agricultural export subsidies are noted. This eliminates some of the worst-case scenarios, if agricultural world prices continue to soften and the important margin of export subsidies still allowed under the WTO framework was to be used. But given the relatively longer transition period for some relevant products before export subsidies are completely banned, the paper argues for continued monitoring of the potential use of this instrument. The paper also discusses the other components of export competition, looking into the legal and economic aspects. Some suggestions about continuous work on <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of current practices, and further disciplines are also presented.

40|$|Although both European {{agencies}} {{and participation in}} European governance are topics very much discussed in the academic literature, they have, thus far, never been systematically researched together. The aim {{of this research is}} to remedy this gap and provide a thorough analytical assessment of the extent and the manner to which European agencies have been successful in living up to the central promises of participation. In this book, the pertinence of involving interested parties, and the reason why some agencies are particularly keen on developing participatory structures {{even in the absence of}} legal provisions rests on the idea that participation may fulfill one or more of the following central promises: (i) ensure better and more informed agencies’ outcomes, (ii) promote inclusiveness and responsiveness of agencies’ operation, (iii) advance compliance and implementation, and (iv) enhance <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of agencies’ activities and help build trust. In line with these promises, the extent and impact of participation can be crucial to agencies’ ability to perform efficiently, as well as to their credibility. But does participation in European agencies deliver on its promises and hence contribute to effective policy-making and agency credibility or is it merely an exercise in window-dressing and an end in itself? The promises of participation are thus an evaluative yardstick against which participation in European agencies is assessed both empirically and normatively...|$|E

40|$|The {{modern era}} of {{corporate}} criminal {{law enforcement is}} dominated by an entity-based approach of compliance. There is broad agreement among prosecutors {{that this is the}} right way to deter misconduct within a company. Indeed, it is the official policy of the Department of Justice, and one of the key principles behind the United States Sentencing Commission’s Organizational Guidelines. Prosecutors should be equally enthusiastic for using this framework to address wrongs that place within a similar organization: the prosecutor’s office itself. Prosecutorial misconduct, whether intentional or negligent, is not an infrequent occurrence. Although most prosecutors follow the law and behave ethically - just as most corporate employees do - that is not true of all prosecutors. A host of studies have documented prosecutorial misconduct, and one of - if not the - most common type of prosecutorial misconduct in these cases involved the suppression of exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland. The existing framework for addressing prosecutorial misconduct is entirely backward-looking - and ineffective. Judges and state bars are supposed to police violations when they occur. But just as a model that focuses solely on individual liability and addressing particular violations after-the-fact proved inadequate in deterring corporate crime, so, too has it failed in addressing misconduct within the larger entity of the prosecutor’s office. Most violations never come to light, and when they do, individual actors responsible for the misconduct rarely face any consequences. Prosecutors recognized these failings when the entity at issue was a corporation. They have aggressively targeted the entity itself to address these shortcomings and to encourage forward-looking reforms. Specifically, they have used the entity as a partner in stopping wrongdoing before it happens by insisting on strong compliance programs that rely on training, supervision, <b>transparency,</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring.</b> This Article argues that it is time for prosecutors to recognize that their own offices should be held to the same standards...|$|E
40|$|This Final Report {{discussed}} four {{case studies}} (whole genome sequencing, neuromodulation, biocybernetic adaptation and standardization in synthetic biology) focusing on particular {{developments in the}} four fields of 21 st-century bio-engineering that were explored more extensively in the earlier Monitoring Report (respectively, the engineering of the body, the brain, intelligent artefacts and living artefacts). The aim of the case studies was to inform and stimulate political debate in the European Parliament by highlighting the bio-engineering developments in each field that have more immediate implications for European policymaking. To make the governance challenges that are posed by these developments more transparent for policymakers, this report introduced a conceptual framework which uses two dimensions {{in the description of}} the cases. One dimension refers to the variety of sociotechnical practices in which new bio-engineering developments are taking shape, while the other refers to the patchwork of regulatory practices that may be affected by these developments. The four case studies show that new bio-engineering technologies are being developed and adopted {{in a wide variety of}} sociotechnical practices, involving different applications and actors. New bio-engineering technologies may be adopted in relatively stable sociotechnical practices, but may also lead to significant changes to established practices or to newly emerging practices. The case studies further explored how this dynamics affects current regimes of regulation relevant to the different sociotechnical practices in which new bio-engineering technologies are taking shape. With regard to this regulatory dimension, three situations can be distinguished. Current regimes of regulation may be perceived as adequate, as being put under pressure, or as no longer adequate (or lacking). On the basis of this conceptual framework we can map the bio-engineering developments described in the different case studies along two dimensions, providing us with an overview of (1) the ways in which sociotechnical practices are being shaped and/or reshaped by new bioengineering technologies and (2) the extent to which established regulatory regimes are being challenged by these changing practices. In reference to these two dimensions and the dynamics between them, this chapter discusses the nature of the governance challenge that European policymakers face. The fundamental governance challenge, as we will argue, is to attune these two dimensions. In other words, how can we align the dynamics of sociotechnical and regulatory practices with respect to the four cases of 21 st-century bio-engineering studied in this report? We have identified twenty different sociotechnical practices that are being shaped and/or reshaped by or are emerging from the bio-engineering technologies presented in the four case studies. An important question for policymakers raised by this sociotechnical dynamics is to what extent current regulatory practices are able to adequately respond to the short-term and long-term implications of the bio-engineering technologies studied here. As the case studies have made clear, there is already a patchwork of regulatory practices in place in the different fields of bio-engineering. Thus, the precise question is: To what extent can current regimes of regulation be perceived as adequate or in need of change? The findings from the four case studies strongly indicate that bio-engineering in the 21 st century will pose a clear regulatory challenge to European politics and policymakers, especially with regard to issues of safety, privacy, bodily and mental integrity, informed consent, transparency and harmonization. The simultaneous impact of bio-engineering technologies on a diversity of existing or emerging sociotechnical practices reveals that the regulatory challenge will often be multifaceted. Existing regulatory frameworks can thus be seen as partly adequate, partly under pressure and partly inadequate, depending on the sociotechnical practice under consideration. This chapter distinguishes two different situations in which potential tensions and misalignments between sociotechnical and regulatory practices may occur: the regulatory zone and the regulatory wasteland. In the regulatory zone, sociotechnical practices are guided by established regulations that may be considered robust enough to deal with changing or newly emerging practices. In other words, the regulations in place can be considered future-proof in their potential to be adapted to or realigned with changing or new sociotechnical practices. In the regulatory wasteland, regulations are lacking or may be seen as inadequate to guide existing, changing or newly emerging sociotechnical practices. In this situation, there will be a genuine need for changes in existing regulations or for the development of new forms of regulation. As we point out in this chapter, the need for the alignment of sociotechnical and regulatory practices poses a governance challenge which is both fundamental and difficult because it relates to future developments which may have a great impact but which are also uncertain in several respects. When dealing with this governance challenge, above all policymakers face technoscientific uncertainty, that is, uncertainty about the speed, direction and nature of technological change in 21 st-century bio-engineering. Technoscientific developments may also change the social and political values that inform the societal and political debate concerning notions such as autonomy or privacy for example, and thus may create uncertainties about the values that should underpin regulatory initiatives. Finally, policymakers face uncertainty about the adequateness of existing regulatory frameworks, that is, about the alignment or misalignment of sociotechnical and regulatory practices in the near or more distant future. These various uncertainties lead to different and sometimes conflicting opinions about the potential impact of bio-engineering developments and the regulatory challenges that may arise from them. Therefore, in our view, political debate is required to determine the nature and urgency of the governance challenges in 21 st-century bio-engineering and the ways to deal with these challenges. Accordingly, our analysis distinguishes three different options for governance which correspond to different interpretations of the bio-engineering developments discussed in the four case studies. The recurrent political question is whether future sociotechnical practices enabled by new bio-engineering developments can be considered substantially equivalent to sociotechnical practices with which we are already familiar: • If this is the case, it can be safely assumed that established regulations for these practices will also apply to the new bio-engineering developments and a wait-and-see strategy would be an appropriate option for governance • If there are reasons for doubt about the equivalence of new sociotechnical practices to already existing forms, the monitoring and assessment of these developments would be an appropriate governance option to determine whether current regulations are adequate • If new bio-engineering developments lead to sociotechnical practices that are evidently different from present practices, existing regulatory frameworks may have to be revised (within the regulatory zone) or new forms of regulation may have to be developed (within the regulatory wasteland) Our concluding reflections on the findings of the different case studies indicate which policy options are most appropriate according to the assessment presented in each case, which is based on consultation with various experts. In the case of whole genome sequencing and biocybernetic adaptation, it was argued that future changes in sociotechnical practices will urge policymakers to start revising and harmonizing existing regulatory frameworks. In addition, new sociotechnical practices are emerging which might require new forms of regulation in the near future. In the case of neuromodulation, it was found that, in general, current regulations are adequate, but need more clarification, <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> on various specific points. In the case of synthetic biology, no particular governance options were recommended, on the grounds that the future of this field is too uncertain to promote a particular strategy. We simply do not know whether synthetic biology will become a real game changer. In the Monitoring Report we argued for a broadening of activities in the field of bioethics because in the 21 st century the bio-engineering debate no longer solely concerns the life sciences, but also NBIC convergence. From our analysis in the Final Report it becomes clear that we should not only broaden the field of bioethics, but also move beyond bioethics to biopolitics. The report namely reveals that bio-engineering in the 21 st century poses a major challenge to European politics and policymakers. This implies that the governance of bio-engineering in the 21 st century not only concerns stimulating scientific reflection and public debate on technological change and its societal implications, but also the political regulation of shifting and newly emerging sociotechnical practices in society. Politicizing bio-engineering developments thus requires more attention to regulatory uncertainties raised by bio-engineering developments. Policy recommendations • In order to increase institutional reflexivity and strengthen the preparedness of the European Parliament and other European institutions to deal with the governance challenges raised by bio-engineering in the 21 st century, politicians and policymakers need to pay more close attention to the experiences of institutions which deal with regulation and its uncertainties • To empower the current European political system to democratically guide bioengineering in the 21 st century, a dedicated and continuous effort is required to make the complex workings and failings of the relevant regulatory systems politically transparent with respect to the present and coming year...|$|E

The focus is on identifying obstacles to effective and economically efficient performance of services delivery in Vietnam, and proposing solutions for substantial improvements to legal frameworks and institutional structures. The central argument of the thesis is that the universal service scheme in Vietnam and the supporting laws and agencies responsible for implementation of the scheme need to be improved in order {{to contribute to the}} achievement of social targets. The universal service funding mechanism in Vietnam, including the allocation of industry levies and subsidies, is not linked to real costs, nor is it efficient. The laws and legal instruments governing the universal service scheme are incomplete and in parts contradictory. Moreover, the institutional structures reflect diffuse and duplicated accountability among the authorities involved, lack of <b>transparency,</b> <b>and</b> insufficient external <b>monitoring</b> mechanisms. Performance information systems and involvement of the public and stakeholders are also insufficient. The insufficiencies in the Vietnamese structure are illustrated in the thesis by comparing them to the key elements of a best practice model.

40|$|Background: Many {{articles}} {{have been written}} on conflicts of interests (COIs) in fields such as medicine, business, politics, public service and education. With the growing abundance of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), often involving complex relationships among the partners, {{it is important to}} understand how COIs can be mitigated and managed in PPPs. Discussion: We wanted to study PPPs, particularly in the areas of global health and agriculture, but discovered no single source of information available to identify and compare various approaches for avoiding and managing COIs in PPPs. This is a significant gap, especially for those wishing to study, compare and strengthen existing COI policies related to PPPs. In order to bridge this gap, we reviewed how PPPs currently address COIs and highlight what might be considered good practice in developing COI policies. We reviewed the online COI policies of 10 PPPs in global health and agriculture, and interviewed two global health PPP chief executives.
