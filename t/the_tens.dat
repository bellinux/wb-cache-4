There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E

5|$|The 1066 {{defeat of}} the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada by the Anglo-Saxon Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Stamford Bridge near York marked the {{beginning}} of the end of Viking rule in England, and the almost immediate defeat of Godwinson at the hands of the Norman William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings was in turn the overthrow of the Anglo-Saxon order. The Northumbrian and Danish aristocracy resisted the Norman Conquest, and to put an end to the rebellion, William ordered the Harrying of the North. In the winter of 1069–1070, towns, villages and farms were systematically destroyed across much of Yorkshire as well as northern Lancashire and County Durham. The region was gripped by famine and much of Northern England was deserted. Chroniclers at the time reported a hundred thousand deaths – modern estimates place the total somewhere in <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands, out of a population of two million. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, much of Northern England was still recorded as wasteland, although this may have been in part because the chroniclers, more interested in manorial farmland, paid little attention to pastoral areas.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{one and two}} player modes, both {{of which}} are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Jr.; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challenging: Donkey Kong can ask for negative numbers, and the absolute values of the target numbers are in the hundreds instead of <b>the</b> <b>tens.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Ethics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 This study {{discusses}} true {{and false}} conversions {{and the use}} of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments in evangelism, viewed from the starting point of a Christian ethical perspective. The use of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments in Evangelism is affirmed by Jesus Himself and also by Jesus’ apostles after His ascension to heaven. The validity of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments is eternal. The modern evangelist has been caught by the snares of Satan with regards to <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments. <b>The</b> power of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments in evoking a true sense of sin is being undermined by a sly plan of Satan that causes enmity between the Law and grace. It has basically brought about two schools of thought: those who use <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments, and those who reject it. Those who use <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments, however, run the risk of using the law in an illegitimate way, and this is termed as “legalism”. On the other hand, those who reject <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments are guilty of “Antinomianism”, that literally means “anti-law”. Consequently, all the underlying principles, which God had laid down for the use of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments, are being blatantly disregarded. Instead, the workings and efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments are exclusively replaced by love and grace. False conversions are the result in both cases. Satan achieves his goal. In opposition to this is the legitimate use of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments as <b>the</b> only means of preventing false conversions. God designed <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments {{in such a way as}} to firstly reveal His holiness as the only standard that a sinner must meet. As the standard requires absolute holiness and perfection, it brings about a sense of sin. This is because no person can fulfill the standard. Without a true sense of sin, no person can be saved. Within the framework of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments, evidence of the person’s love towards God is comprised through the upholding of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments. <b>The</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments cannot save anyone, but if the person loves Jesus, they will keep His commandments; a sign of true conversion. The goal of this study was to determine whether any guidelines can be composed to help Evangelists prevent or minimize false conversions, in a Biblically justified manner. The research indicates that without the use of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments during evangelism, many false conversions will ensue. The conclusion of this research is that false conversions can be prevented or minimized through the legitimate use of <b>the</b> <b>Ten</b> Commandments during evangelism. Doctora...|$|R
5|$|The {{win over}} #14Virginia Tech enabled the Bulldogs {{to break into}} the Top25 rankings in the final college {{football}} poll of the season. Georgia was ranked#23 in the country thanks to its win over the Hokies, who dropped to #19nationally following the loss. The loss snapped a six-game winning streak by Virginia Tech and ended the Hokies' bid at becoming just the fourth team in school history to win 11 games in a season.

5|$|When Odilo Globocnik made a {{surprise}} visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. Among {{the reasons for}} dismissal were: incompetently disposing of <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up {{the pace of the}} programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.|$|E

After two weeks, however, {{taking advantage of a}} short truce for negotiations requested by one of the Byzantine commanders of the breach, the Abbasid army stormed the city. The city was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed, while the populace, numbering into <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands, was carried off to be sold into slavery. According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when the conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was uncovered. Al-Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, without bothering with Theophilos and his forces, encamped in nearby Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E
