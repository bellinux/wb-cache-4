Castellesi was compensated by being promoted to the wealthier See of Bath and Wells. Castellesi lost favour with the king and fled Rome until the death of Julius II.|$|E

5|$|In August 1928, Godley was {{appointed}} to the governorship of Gibraltar, a position in which he remained until his retirement in 1933. Godley was considered the ablest of the immediate post war governors although he made a misjudgement in interfering in the politics of the Royal Calpe Hunt. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> <b>had</b> to intercede after Godley removed the master of the hunt creating large divisions that were not repaired until his successor took charge.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> said Becket was free to return at any time, but {{would still have to}} answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, although {{there is no evidence that}} Becket bought the office. By 1166, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E
5|$|John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, died in December 1292. On 13 February 1293, Winchelsey {{was elected}} as his successor. Unusually, neither the pope nor <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> {{a hand in}} his election. On 1 April, Winchelsey left England for Rome to get papal confirmation. He was not consecrated {{immediately}} because of a papal vacancy; Celestine V eventually performed the ceremony at Aquila on 12 September 1294.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{degree of}} Caroline's wealth was always {{problematic}} to trace, as <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> placed {{so much of}} it in different sources often difficult to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death. One 1912 source for instance reported that out of the king's estimated estate of $65,000,000, Caroline received $7,000,000, while others stressed still higher numbers, and that the majority of it came from Congo shares.|$|E

5|$|A {{common theme}} in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce {{protection}} {{of what he}} regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, {{at the height of}} the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.|$|E
5|$|After Henry of Anjou's {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of England as Henry II in 1154, Foliot persuaded the Earl of Hereford {{to submit to the}} new king's demand that he return the custody of certain royal castles to the king. In the summer of 1160, Foliot wrote to Pope Alexander III, whom <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> just recognised as pope instead of Alexander's rival, Victor IV, intimating that the canonisation of King Edward the Confessor, which had been delayed by Alexander's predecessor Innocent II, might be warranted as a reward for Henry's recognition of Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E

The king again asks {{the advice of the}} spaeman, who tentatively suggests that the king's only daughter, Princess Gem-de-lovely, his most prized possession, will have to be offered to the stoor worm to encourage it to leave. During the ten-week period of grace before the princess has to be sacrificed, messengers are despatched to every corner of the realm offering the kingdom, marriage to the princess, and the magic sword <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> inherited from the god Odin.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> <b>had</b> issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London {{about how to deal with}} the revolt. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> <b>had</b> only a few troops at hand, in the form of the castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Parisian uprisings {{during the}} Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court {{to a new}} palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and {{sciences}} in the city flourished with the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate {{that the city was}} safe from attack, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards of today. Other marks of his reign were the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vend√¥me, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages, the Anuradhapura Kingdom {{did not have}} a strong regular army except for a small body of soldiers. These were {{assigned}} for guarding the capital and the royal palace. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> <b>had</b> the right to demand an able bodied son for military service from every family in his kingdom. In times of war, a larger army was formed using this method. An army consisted of four main divisions; an elephant corps, cavalry, chariots and infantry. This combination was called Chaturangani Sena (fourfold army). However, the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen, spearmen and archers.|$|E
5|$|Early in Becket's exile, Robert {{received}} a papal censure {{for not doing}} more to support Becket. In summer 1165, Robert accompanied Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, on a papal mission to King Henry, to convey to the king Pope Alexander's complaints about the king's behaviour. <b>The</b> <b>king</b> <b>had</b> been preventing his subjects from visiting or appealing to the papacy, and Alexander wished to protest against that, as well as against the king's treatment of Becket. In 1166, Becket tried to convince Robert to switch sides, writing to Robert in conciliatory tones. John of Salisbury, a supporter of Becket's, prevailed upon two French academics to write to Robert, criticising him for hypocrisy.|$|E
