40|$|Existing {{knowledge}} {{about the impact of}} the experience prior to financial choices has been limited almost exclusively to single risky choices. Moreover, the results obtained in these studies have not been entirely consistent. For example, some studies suggested that the experience of success makes people more willing to take a risk, while other studies led to the opposite conclusions. The results of the two experimental studies presented in this paper provide evidence for the hypothesis that the experience of success or failure influences people’s financial choices, but the effect of the success or failure depends on the type of task (financial and non-financial) preceding a financial decision. The experience of success in financial tasks increased participants’ <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> and make risky investment choices, while it also made them less prone to save. On the other hand, the experience of failure heightened the amount of money that participants decided to save, and lowered their <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> and make risky investment choices. However, the effects of the experience of success or failure in non-financial tasks were exactly the opposite.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{contract}} duration on the incentive to make relationship-specific investments, when {{the parties to the}} relationship are rational, with perfect information and perfect foresight, and contracts are costlessly enforceable and complete, except that short-term contracts do not allow commitments to actions taken beyond the contract period. Whether contracting for less than the entire life of the relationship suffices for efficient relationship-specific investment is shown to depend on whether parties need their relationship for consumption-smoothing, and on the predominance, in the efficient plan, of investment that involves sunk costs over investment that does not. In the absence of asymmetric-information incentive problems, the duration of contracts affects investment decisions only when the relationship plays a consumption-smoothing role, and then only when efficiency requires mainly sunk-cost investment. In this case, short-term contracting has a general, but not universal, <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> make parties <b>invest</b> too little in their relationship...|$|R
40|$|We tested {{interventions}} to reduce “sunk-cost bias,” the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>investing</b> in failing plans even when those plans have soured and {{are no longer}} rewarding. We showed members of a national U. S. life-span panel a hypothetical scenario about a failing plan that was halfway complete. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} an intervention to focus on how to improve the situation, an intervention to focus on thoughts and feelings, or a no-intervention control group. First, we found that the thoughts and feelings intervention reduced sunk-cost bias in decisions about project completion, as compared to the improvement intervention and the no-intervention control. Second, older age was associated with greater willingness to cancel the failing plan across all three groups. Third, we found that introspection processes helped to explain the effectiveness of the interventions. Specifically, the larger reduction in sunk-cost bias as observed in the thoughts and feelings intervention (vs. the improvement intervention) was associated with suppression of future-oriented thoughts of eventual success, and with suppression of augmentations of the scenario that could make it seem reasonable to continue the plan. Fourth, we found that introspection processes were related to age differences in decisions. Older people were less likely to mention future-oriented thoughts of eventual success associated with greater willingness to continue the failing plan.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{integration}} level of supply chain performance measurement among the largest production and commercial companies in Poland. Modern advanced measurement systems should analyze both the performance of individual organizations in the supply chains and the performance of a supply chain as a whole (integrated approach). Many international researches show that lack of information about the situation in the entire supply chain and lack of methods to analyze the entire network of partners is one of the most important barriers to improve the performance. A questionnaire survey was carried out within the research project ʽMeasuring the performance of supply chains in the largest production and commercial companies in Poland’. The survey involved a sample of 79 senior level managers responsible for logistics/supply chain management of the companies listed on the ʽRanking of 500 largest companies in Poland by Rzeczpospolita Daily’. It was carried out with the use of CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) method. The final form of the questionnaire was adopted after conducting a pilot study with logistics / supply chain directors of three leading companies in Poland. Methods of supply chain performance measurement used on Polish market do not take into account to a sufficient degree all the cooperating partners in the extended supply chain (from suppliers’ suppliers to the final consumer), what has a negative impact on the performance of these chains. The research results indicate that the main barriers to the implementation of advanced measurement systems include: insufficient awareness of managers concerning the role of supply chains management in building the real value, low <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in advanced tools that support such measurement, fear of increase in costs, as well as reluctance to share information with partners. The study shows a potential to improve existing achievements, which should arouse interest of companies.

40|$|The central aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how to apply artificial neural networks in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). The paper presents several business applications of neural networks in software systems designed to aid CRM, e. g. in deciding on the profitability of building a relationship with a given customer. Furthermore, a framework for a neural-network based CRM software tool is developed. Building beneficial relationships with customers is generating considerable interest among various businesses, and is often mentioned as one of the crucial objectives of enterprises, next to their key aim: to bring satisfactory profit. There is a growing <b>tendency</b> among businesses <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in CRM systems, which together with an organisational culture of a company aid managing customer relationships. It is the sheer amount of gathered data as well as the need for constant updating and analysis of this breadth of information that may imply the suitability of neural networks for the application in question.

In the majority of presented CRM applications neural networks constitute and are presented as a managerial decision-taking optimisation tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Public {{electricity}} {{provision in}} Africa has been marred by under investment and frequent power outages. One {{of the strategies}} often adopted by firms {{to cope with this}} poor public supply is investment in backup generation. This strategy is not without cost however. Extant literatures on outage cost estimation have shown that firms possessing certain characteristics have a higher <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in backup generation. What is less known, however, is whether those firms suffer lesser or higher unmitigated outage losses (costs). Using cross-sectional data from 6854 firms currently operating in 12 African countries, this study investigated the extent to which firms ’ characteristics might create incentives for auto-generation and whether these incentives lead to lesser unmitigated outage costs. We used three different methods including marginal cost, incomplete backup and subjective evaluation techniques. The results reveal that large firms, firms engaging in exports, and those using the Internet for their operation still suffer higher unmitigated outage costs despite having a higher propensity of investing in backup generation. The results further reveal that unmitigated costs still account for the larger proportion of the total outage costs despite high prevalence of backup ownership among the firms. This reflects th...|$|E
40|$|There is now {{extensive}} {{evidence that}} individual investors {{have a strong}} <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in domestic rather than foreign equity. 1 This “home bias in portfolios can potentially {{have important implications for}} economic behavior and economic policy. For one, it suggests that extra savings in a country will be invested primarily at home, consistent with the evidence for a lack of international capital mobility reported in Feldstein and Horioka (1980). In addition, the implied lack of capital mobility may explain the observed taxation of the return to domestic capital. In particular, when capital is fully mobile internationally a tax on domestic capital in a small country does not affect the net–of–tax rate of return available to capital owners and instead would be borne by immobile factors, primarily labor. In this setting, Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) show that such a tax would be dominated by labor income taxes (or consumption taxes) even from the perspective of workers. If capital were not so mobile, however, then capital should bear part of the tax, so that the tax might well be chosen for distributional reasons. These presumed implications of home bias can only be judged, however, in the contex...|$|E
