5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the <b>tunica</b> intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the <b>tunica</b> media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E

5|$|More serious {{retaliation}} {{against the}} Natchez began late in December and in January 1730, with expeditions led by Jean-Paul Le Sueur and Henri de Louboëy. The two commanders besieged the Natchez in forts built {{near the site}} of the Grand Village of the Natchez, a mile or so east of Fort Rosalie, which had been rebuilt. They killed about 80 men and captured 18 women, and released some French women who had been captured during the massacre of Fort Rosalie. The French relied on allied support from <b>Tunica</b> and Choctaw warriors. The Choctaw attacked the Natchez without the French, killing 100 and capturing women and children. This ruined the element of surprise for the French as the Natchez had already scattered. At first, the Natchez were well prepared for French retaliatory strikes, having stocked up several cannons as well as the firearms that they had used in the massacre two months earlier. The Natchez captured by the Choctaw and <b>Tunica</b> allies of the French were given over to the governor and sold into slavery, and some were publicly tortured to death in New Orleans.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The Propionibacterium acnes and the Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii are {{occasional}} pathogenic bacteria.

Case Presentation. We report the case of a 72 -year-old man who is under observation for pain and swelling of the left hemiscrotum associated to high fever. The scrotal ultrasound shows the presence of a left intra-scrotal abscess with didymus, epididymis, and intact didymus-epididymis <b>tunicae.</b> The blood culture executed for evening fever during antibiotic therapy has underlined an infection with Propionibacterium acnes. A following blood culture has shown an increase in Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii. Due to fever the patient has undergone left orchifunicolectomy with inguino-scrotal toilet.

40|$|Depending on the glycan structure, {{proteoglycans}} {{can act as}} coreceptors {{for growth}} factors. We hypothesized that proteoglycans and their growth factor ligands orchestrate tissue remodeling in chronic transplant dysfunction. We have previously shown perlecan to be selectively up-regulated in the glomeruli and arteries in a rat renal transplantation model. Using the same model, here we present quantitative RT-PCR profiling data on proteoglycans and growth factors from laser-microdissected glomeruli, arterial <b>tunicae</b> mediae, and neointimae at 12 weeks after transplantation. In glomeruli and neointimae of allografts, selective induction of the matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan was observed, along with massive accumulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2). Profiling the heparan sulfate polysaccharide side chains revealed conversion from a non-FGF 2 -binding heparan sulfate phenotype in control and isografted kidneys toward a FGF 2 -binding phenotype in allografts. In vitro experiments with perlecan-positive rat mesangial cells showed that FGF 2 -induced proliferation is dependent on sulfation and can be inhibited by exogenously added heparan sulfate. These findings indicate that matrix proteoglycans such as perlecan serve as functional docking platforms for FGF 2 in chronic transplant dysfunction. We speculate that heparin-like glycomimetics could be a promising intervention to retard development of glomerulosclerosis and neointima formation in chronic transplant dysfunctio...|$|R

Fine particle (PM(2. 5)) concentration was determined gravimetrically; hearts were analyzed by morphometry. There was a reduction of the PM(2. 5) inside the filtered chamber (filtered = 8. 61 +/- 0. 79 mu g/m(3), nonfiltered = 18. 05 +/- 1. 25 mu g/m(3), p <. 001).

Numerous IR-NPY nerve fibers were mostly concentrated in the inner part of the adventitia close to the media of the arterial and venous vessels and among the intracavernous smooth muscle cells. IR-NPY nerve fibers were less abundant in veins than in arteries. Positive somata were not observed in the penises. At the ultrastructural level, IR-NPY were localized exclusively in large, dense granules of nerve terminals {{by means of the}} postembedding immunogold technique. In the deep dorsal vein, IR-NPY nerve fibers were also located in the media formed by an outer circular and an inner longitudinal layer. In the intracavernous and dorsal arteries, they showed the highest density in the inner part of the adventitia. In the corpora cavernosa and in the corpus spongiosum, IR-NPY nerve processes were intermingled between the smooth-muscle fibers around the sinusoid spaces. IR-NPY nerve fibers were present in the cavernous nerves close to the central arteries. The urethra did not show any IR-NPY-positive nerve fibers. This peculiar distribution of IR-NPY nerve fibers suggested that they could participate in regulating arterial and venous blood flow and intracavernous smooth-muscle tone.
