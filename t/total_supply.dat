40|$|Nitrogen (N) supply from organic {{amendments}} [such as {{farmyard manure}} (FYM), slurries or crop residues] to crops is commonly {{expressed in the}} amendment’s Nitrogen Fertiliser Replacement Value (NFRV). Values for NFRV can be determined by comparison of crop yield or N uptake in amended plots against mineral fertiliser-only plots. NFRV is then defined {{as the amount of}} mineral fertiliser N saved when using organic amendment-N (kg/kg), while attaining the same crop yield. Factors known to affect NFRV are crop type cultivated, soil type, manuring history and method or time of application. We investigated whether long-term NFRV depends on N application rates. Using data from eight long term experiments in Europe, values of NFRV at low <b>total</b> N <b>supply</b> were compared with values of NFRV at high <b>total</b> N <b>supply.</b> Our findings show that FYM has a significant higher NFRV value at high <b>total</b> N <b>supply</b> than at low <b>total</b> N <b>supply</b> (1. 12 vs. 0. 53, p = 0. 04). For the other amendment types investigated, NFRV was also higher at high <b>total</b> N <b>supply</b> than at low <b>total</b> N <b>supply,</b> but sample sizes were too small or variations too large to detect significant differences. Farmers in Europe usually operate at high rates of total N applied.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage being generated from the use of a drop-through rotary valve in a full-scale pneumatic conveying system. When producing a set ofpneumatic conveying characteristics for a test program, rotary valve air leakage is often not considered. In reality, the air mass flowrate in the conveying line will be less than the <b>total</b> <b>supplied</b> air mass flowrate due to air leakage through the rotary valve. By measuring the air leakage and adjusting the <b>total</b> <b>supplied</b> air mass flowrate to represent the actual air mass flowrate travelling through the conveying line, a more accurate representation of the conveying conditions can be obtained. Hence the design of pneumatic conveying systems can be determined more precisely. Tests have been performed and plots have been produced showing both the pneumatic conveying characteristics before and after rotary valve air leakage has been taken into account. These results show that rotary valve air leakage can have quite an effect, with some tests losing more than 50010 ofthe supplied air mass flowrate through the rotary valve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the active control strategies of minimizing the <b>total</b> power <b>supplied</b> to a plate and maximizing the power absorbed by the secondary source. Force and moment excitations of infinite and finite plates are considered. For an infinite plate analytic solutions can be obtained for the <b>total</b> power <b>supplied</b> to the plate by the primary and secondary actuator arrays when using the two control strategies. Minimizing the power supplied by a primary force or moment with a secondary force or moment can produce large attenuation provided that the two sources are close together compared with a flexural wavelength. Minimizing the power supplied by a primary force with a secondary moment can also give attenuation of up to 5 dB when the spacing between the sources is about 0 · 3 times the flexural wavelength. In contrast to the acoustic case, for the infinite plate the <b>total</b> power <b>supplied</b> is generally reduced when the power absorbed by the secondary source is maximized. On a finite panel, however, maximizing the power absorbed by the secondary source can significantly increase the <b>total</b> power <b>supplied.</b> The strategy of minimizing the <b>total</b> power <b>supplied</b> can give considerably larger values of attenuation for finite rather than infinite plates, particularly at higher frequencies. This is because the structural modes can be actively controlled.
