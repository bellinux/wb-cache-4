5|$|A new {{government}} center {{was to be}} built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila.

5|$|Anne's {{seventeen}} pregnancies by George {{resulted in}} twelve miscarriages or stillbirths, four infant deaths, and a chronically sick son, William, {{who died at}} the age of eleven. Despite the history of their children, George and Anne's marriage was a strong one. George died aged 55 from a recurring and chronic lung disease, much to <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> his wife, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth and Philip {{were married}} on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They {{received}} 2500 wedding gifts {{from around the}} world. Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnell. In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, {{to be invited to}} the wedding. The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 the British Council awarded Roa Bastos a nine-month {{fellowship}} for {{journalism in}} London. During {{this time he}} traveled extensively in Britain, France and Africa and witnessed <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> WWII first hand. He served as the El País war correspondent, notably conducting an interview with General Charles de Gaulle after the latter's return to Paris in 1945. Roa Bastos also broadcast Latin American programs {{at the invitation of}} the BBC and France's Ministry of Information.|$|E
5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|By 1388, <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> Dalmatia by the Bosnian {{army had}} become so severe that the {{authorities}} of the cities pleaded with Sigismund to either help them or {{to allow them to}} save themselves by submitting without being labeled as traitors. Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each of the cities asked to be the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E
5|$|Immigrant {{communities}} {{first developed}} in the riverside settlements. From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships' crews were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crew would be found wherever they were available, local sailors being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in foreign ports. Crews would be paid off {{at the end of}} their voyage. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of Lascars and Africans from the Guinea Coast. Large Chinatowns at both Shadwell and Limehouse developed, associated with the crews of merchantmen in the opium and tea trades. It was only after <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War that this predominantly Han Chinese community relocated to Soho.|$|E
5|$|After Hurricane Fay caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} {{on the island}} just days before, residents of Bermuda were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed {{in advance of the}} storm, while the Royal Navy ship HMS Argyll left its post in the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central Bermuda at Category 2 strength around 00:30 UTC on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as , downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. Bermuda Regiment soldiers and sailors from the Argyll took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did not compare to <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that Bermuda suffered up to $400million in losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there.|$|E

60|$|The {{reasons for}} the rise of value in lands, are of two kinds.

50|$|It {{was built}} by will of the Paternò Castello family, the princes of Biscari, {{starting}} from the late 17th century, lasting {{for much of the}} following century, after <b>the</b> <b>devastations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11 January 1693 earthquake. The new palace was built directly against the city walls (Charles V's walls), which had partially withstood the earthquake.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of all these processes, large numbers of memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their construction stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials to the events of World War I, mainly as {{a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E
5|$|Onneca's father Fortún Garcés, {{the then}} {{heir to the}} throne of Pamplona, was {{captured}} in 860 in the town of Milagro during a punitive expedition led by Muhammad I, the Muslim emir of Córdoba, against the small Kingdom of Pamplona. The expedition resulted in <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> the Christian kingdom's territory and the seizure of three castles by the Muslim forces. Fortun Garcés, nicknamed al-Anqar (الأنقر) by the Muslims because he was one-eyed, was taken to Córdoba where he was detained for two decades in gilded captivity. Onneca accompanied or followed her father to Córdoba, where she was wedded to Muhammad I's son Abdullah around 862/863. It is not known when or how she came to Córdoba. She may have been captured with her father, or sent to join her father at the emir's court at a later date. Onneca was presumably still a teenager when she bore Abdullah a son named Muhammad in 864. As Abdullah's wife, Onneca became known as Durr. According to some sources, she converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|The next era of Kīlauea's history {{began with}} the {{establishment}} of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; after witnessing <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, he declared that something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kīlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes. After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea's caldera.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, {{the rural}} {{population}} of Pomerania {{was dominated by}} free farmers working on their own, small, hereditary farms.

5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after <b>the</b> <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E

50|$|In {{the course}} of the Polish-Teutonic War the town was burnt down in 1433 by Hussite forces marching through. During the Thirty Years' War, the Swedish field marshal Gustav Horn on 23 January 1631 signed the Treaty of Bärwalde with France against Emperor Ferdinand II of Habsburg, whereafter the town was devastated by Swedish and Imperial troops several times. <b>The</b> <b>devastations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war {{resulted}} in a severe population drop: only 30 inhabitants remained. From 1650-73 Elias Loccelius, also known as Elias Lockelius or Löckel, (1621-1704) was pastor in Bärwalde and from there he moved to Drossen (today Ośno Lubuskie). He is known as a chronicler of the New March and was an electoral church inspector for Land Sternberg as well.
