25|$|Following Husserl, Sartre views absurdity as {{a quality}} of all {{existing}} objects (and of the material world collectively), independent of any stance humans might take with respect to <b>them.</b> <b>Our</b> consciousness of an object does not inhere in the object itself. Thus in the early portions of the novel, Roquentin, who takes no attitude towards objects and has no stake in them, is totally estranged from the world he experiences. The objects themselves, in their brute existence, have only participation in a meaningless flow of events: they are superfluous. This alienation from objects casts doubt for him, in turn, on his own validity and even his own existence.|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to <b>them.</b> <b>Our</b> ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E
25|$|Planetary nebulae {{form when}} low-mass {{asymptotic}} giant branch stars nova. A star that novas pushes {{the outer layers}} of the star's mass outward forming gaseous shells, while leaving behind the star's core {{in the form of}} a white dwarf. The hot white dwarf illuminates the expelled gases producing emission nebulae with spectra similar to those of emission nebulae found in star formation regions. Technically they are HII regions, because most hydrogen will be ionized, but they are denser and more compact than the nebulae found in star formation regions. Planetary nebulae were given their name by the first astronomical observers who were initially unable to distinguish them from planets, and who tended to confuse them with planets, which were of more interest to <b>them.</b> <b>Our</b> Sun is expected to spawn a planetary nebula about 12 billion years after its formation.|$|E

[...] The Grand Prix also marked the first win by Toro Rosso, the first non-Ferrari Italian-based team to win since 1957.

Time noted that arena workers would be affected by the cancellation of games. However, separate studies by University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Lake Forest College found no historic significant effect to the economies of cities with sports franchises affected by work stoppages. Explanations included consumer shifting of spending on sporting events to other forms of entertainment, reduced local government spending on crowd and traffic control, and higher productivity by the general workforce without the distraction of games.|$|E

In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad.

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to teach delayed gratification when children grow up expecting a large, instant reward for their years of schooling. Societal impacts and current media trends have {{had the effect of}} teaching people to expect instant gratification. The idea of waiting for a good job, earned through working from the bottom up, frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today's society. This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces, but also in interpersonal relationships. Current studies show that 45% of marriages will end in divorce. Without the ability to delay gratification people are more apt to end relationships rather than work on <b>them.</b> <b>Our</b> society today makes it increasingly easy to receive instant gratification. According to Daniel Forrester, [...] "e have devalued the time we spend alone just thinking, but it's that time for reflection that leads to the big ideas [...] Multitasking is espoused and almost glorified in the United States, but it is dehumanizing us and making us less creative." ...|$|E

500|$|On April 7, 1848, in {{response}} to a citizen's petition, the New York State Assembly passed the Married Woman's Property Act, giving women the right to retain property they brought into a marriage, as well as property they acquired during the marriage. Creditors could not seize a wife's property to pay a husband's debts. Leading up to the passage of this law, in 1846, supporters issued a pamphlet, probably authored by Judge John Fine, which relied on its readers' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand [...] "That all are created free and equal...", and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes. [...] "Women, as well as men, are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings". A group of 44married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848, saying [...] "your Declaration of Independence declares, that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And as women have never consented to, been represented in, or recognized by this government, it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from <b>them...</b> <b>Our</b> numerous and yearly petitions for this most desirable object having been disregarded, we now ask your august body, to abolish all laws which hold married women more accountable for their acts than infants, idiots, and lunatics." ...|$|E
500|$|Western {{intelligence}} agencies {{believed that the}} revolution had been organised by communists supplied with weapons by the Warsaw Pact countries. This suspicion was strengthened by the appointment of Babu as Minister for External Affairs and Abdullah Kassim Hanga as Prime Minister, both known leftists with possible communist ties. Britain believed that these two were close associates of Oscar Kambona, the Foreign Affairs Minister of Tanganyika, and that {{former members of the}} Tanganyika Rifles had been made available to assist with the revolution. Some members of the Umma Party wore Cuban military fatigues and beards in the style of Fidel Castro, which was taken as an indication of Cuban support for the revolution. However this practice was started by those members who had staffed a ZNP branch office in Cuba and it became a common means of dress amongst opposition party members {{in the months leading up}} to the revolution. The new Zanzibar government's recognition of the German Democratic Republic (the first African government to do so), and of North Korea, was further evidence to the Western Powers that Zanzibar was aligning itself closely with the communist bloc. Just six days after the revolution the New York Times stated that Zanzibar was [...] "on the verge of becoming the Cuba of Africa", but on 26 January denied that there was active communist involvement. Zanzibar continued to receive support from communist countries and by February was known to be receiving advisers from USSR, East Germany and China. Cuba also lent its support with Che Guevara stating on 15 August that [...] "Zanzibar is our friend and we gave <b>them</b> <b>our</b> small bit of assistance, our fraternal assistance, our revolutionary assistance at the moment when it was necessary" [...] but denying there were Cuban troops present during the revolution. At the same time, western influence was diminishing and by July 1964 just one Briton, a dentist, remained in the employ of the Zanzibari government. It has been alleged that Israeli spymaster David Kimche was a backer of the revolution with Kimche in Zanzibar on the day of the Revolution.|$|E
