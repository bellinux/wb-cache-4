5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> {{absolute}} scorching deal on {{cases of}} PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>this,</b> that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

500|$|GoldenEye 007 was {{developed}} by an inexperienced team; eight of its ten developers had never previously worked on video games. As programmer David Doak recalls, [...] "Looking back, there are things I'd be wary of attempting now, but as none of the people working on the code, graphics, and game design had worked on a game before, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> joyful naïveté." [...] Due {{to the success of}} Donkey Kong Country, GoldenEye 007 was originally suggested as a 2D side-scrolling platformer for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but Martin Hollis, the director and producer of the game, proposed [...] "a 3D shooting game" [...] for Nintendo's in-development [...] "Ultra 64" [...] console.|$|E

[...] When Long {{decided to leave the}} show, the creators knew they wanted a new female lead who was unknown to television viewers, would not have blonde hair and resemble Long. Kirstie Alley {{was one of the first}} actresses to audition for the role of Rebecca Howe. Although she met all the criteria, the producers continued to audition actresses, but none improved on Alley's portrayal of the character. Following which brunette-haired Alley debuted as Rebecca Howe.|$|E

I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{forced the}} NHL and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to {{reassess}} {{all aspects of}} how the game was played in North America. Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way: [...] "The Europeans took our game and evolved it, while we stood still or even went backwards. [...] The Russians had a style, and the Czechs' style was different from that... <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> hockey world evolving through international competition, and we're back here, stuck, just playing ourselves. [...] It was a business monopoly. [...] And like any monopoly, the NHL got stagnant." [...] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Canadian hockey encouraged the adoption of new coaching and training methods used in Europe, and emphasized conditioning and skills development.|$|E

What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just {{want to know if you}} like it enough to consider it".

500|$|Atkinson {{has said}} that in the buildup to the final episode, he began to psychologically {{experience}} something of his character's apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled [...] "I remember...in {{the weeks leading up to}} the one day recording of that final episode when we went over the top, for the first time in my acting career...knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> deep twist in my stomach throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed. It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel this all the time... Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E

I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

[...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice.
