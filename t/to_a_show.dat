In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer {{from a wide variety of}} health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.|$|E

5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show,</b> she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E

Olmedo remarked {{that he had never}} seen one of Bueno's shows, and Bueno invited him <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> that same night at the club Escándalo in La Plata. Bueno gave a two-and-a-half hour performance {{in front of an audience}} of 2,000. When the concert was over, he was asked to stay at the club to rest, but Bueno refused, expressing his desire to drive.|$|E

25|$|Most modern domes {{are built}} from thin {{aluminium}} sections with ribs providing a supporting structure behind. The use of aluminium {{makes it easy}} to perforate the dome with thousands of tiny holes. This reduces the reflectivity of sound back to the audience (providing better acoustic characteristics), lets a sound system project through the dome from behind (offering sound that seems to come from appropriate directions related <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show),</b> and allows air circulation through the projection surface for climate control.|$|E
25|$|In their reply <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Show</b> Cause Notice, Al Jazeera {{said that}} all maps that are {{displayed}} by them are generated by an internationally known software used by Global News Providers.

As per {{the order of the}} Information and Broadcasting Ministry, the Inter Ministerial Committee which was also attended by representatives of the Ministry of External Affairs, after deliberations, held that the channel had clearly violated the provisions of the programme code and prohibited transmission or re-transmission of the channel throughout India for five days.|$|E

25|$|Several {{programs}} have documented the behind-the-scenes {{events of the}} show. A 60 Minutes report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show,</b> with crowded meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted {{the involvement of the}} guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear. Similarly, there has been an A episode of Biography which covered the production process, as well as an episode of TV Tales in 2002 on E!. In 2010, Saturday Night, a 94-minute documentary by actor James Franco in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by John Malkovich, from the concept stage to the episode actually airing live. Although it originated as a five-minute short film for Franco's New York University film class, Michaels granted Franco access to the process, allowing the project to be expanded. On February 15, 2015, NBC aired a 3 1/2-hour special on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary. The program included a mix of clips, new performances of classic characters from previous cast members and special guest appearances from previous hosts.|$|E

In writing of the episode, Nick Zaino of TV Squad said: [...] "Overall, a well-paced, well-written episode, {{and a whole lot}} of creepy fun", and said the scenes with Kane and Belzer were [...] "laugh-out-loud funny".|$|E

500|$|Many {{reviewer}}s {{commented that}} the dark tone of the final episode {{was typical of the}} series. A reviewer for BBC Comedy said that it [...] "was a characteristically dark end <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> which was never afraid to explore the flip side of the comedy coin." [...] UKTV Gold's website says [...] "it was a suitably downbeat end to an equally downbeat man." [...] Commenting that killing off the protagonist [...] "might seem an odd way for a sitcom to end," [...] the British Film Institute's ScreenOnline says that in a series [...] "where comedy and tragedy are so intertwined, it seems entirely appropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|Portnoy {{wrote the}} lyrics to [...] "Never Enough" [...] as a {{response}} to fans who Portnoy perceived to complain about every thing that Dream Theater did. Portnoy stated that while he appreciated the devotion of Dream Theater's fans, he was frustrated because he was [...] "constantly tearing [...] away from [...] family" [...] to give more to the fans. He found it discouraging that, even though he spent [...] "countless nights" [...] writing special setlists and the band spent days rehearsing, some fans would still complain that they went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> and did not hear [...] "Pull Me Under".

500|$|Poco Pine {{was shown}} {{about five times}} as a weanling, winning all the halter classes he was shown in. Curtner, however, {{felt that he was}} slow to develop and {{therefore}} didn't show him as a yearling or as a two-year-old. By 1957 Curtner felt that Poco Pine was once again ready to perform, and took him <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> in Fort Worth, Texas. Although Poco Pine won his class, Curtner was sure the horse wouldn't win either Grand Champion or Reserve Grand Champion, and ended up betting B. F. Phillips and Billy Bush that Poco Pine would not win the championship or reserve. [...] Poco Pine won the Championship, which meant that Curtner lost money on his horse winning.|$|E
