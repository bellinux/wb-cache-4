5|$|While MIT is {{a private}} institution, Walker's {{extensive}} civic activities as President set the precedent for future presidents to use the post to fulfill civic and cultural obligations throughout Boston.

Walker was committed to a variety of reforms in public and normal schools such as secular curricula, expanding <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> arithmetic, reducing <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> ineffectual home exercises, and increasing the pay and training of teachers.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> Mary's freedom of choice, {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

5|$|Somervell still pursued his own designs, making {{important}} changes, {{including the}} addition of a fifth story. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency, and by May 1942, some 13,000 workers were working around the clock on the building, which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of $63 million, the overrun being caused by <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> speed and {{the addition of}} the extra floor.

The purpose of the name was to reaffirm adherence to the University's historic focus on the liberal arts, and distinguish it from other, more vocational, institutions.|$|E

5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E

In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> style over substance, and has stated that Obama is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E

Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which {{he and his family}} had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} Achebean ending {{results in}} the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People, for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even with <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> colonialism, however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|To remain undetected, {{the player}} can perform {{techniques}} which {{make use of}} both Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with location of nearby enemies and their field of vision. Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and a cardboard box disguise. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard and {{serving in the}} Army during World War I, Tunis began his writing career freelancing for American sports {{magazines}} while playing tennis in the Rivera. For {{the next two decades}} he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E
5|$|India {{experienced}} similar {{development to}} China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated {{different styles of}} music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and tremolos of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, {{as evidenced by the}} frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music. Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.|$|E
