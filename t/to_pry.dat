5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away at war. He has a strange dream, where he sees himself as Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood. The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> about his dreams, but Bran ignores her questions. The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E

When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces, Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him. Marge and Lisa try <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> them apart. Despite her inability to talk, Maggie calls the police on her family before taking hold of Marge and attempting to pull her off Homer. With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance.|$|E
5|$|The sea otter's use {{of rocks}} when hunting and feeding makes {{it one of}} the few mammal species to use tools. To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against a rock on its chest. <b>To</b> <b>pry</b> an abalone off its rock, it hammers the abalone shell using a large stone, with {{observed}} rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds. Releasing an abalone, which can cling to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its own body weight, requires multiple dives.|$|E
5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the first}} {{attempts}} to develop a metaphysical theory and a deep analysis of impossible worlds was due <b>to</b> <b>Priest</b> [26]. In this paper, {{he pointed out that}} in general, non-normal worlds were defined as a mere technical device with no real significance. According <b>to</b> <b>Priest,</b> non-normal worlds are essentially those where theorems, that is, semantically logical truths, may fail. In the rest of the paper, he analyzed the essence of impossible worlds, their semantics, and proof theory. Later, Priest [27] has edited a special issue of the Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic to discuss the topic [24].|$|R

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E

During the {{introduction}} of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and {{the lip of the}} stage surface, which crushed his foot and produced a severe hematoma from the ankle down, with most of the damage centering within his toes. It took approximately 30seconds <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and kept holding his hand on his knee as he began singing.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most vipers, {{members of}} this genus will strike and then hold on and chew. In one case, a machete was used <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> off the jaws. March (1929) wrote that A. mexicanus (A. nummifer) will hang on and make half a dozen {{punctures}} unless quickly and forcibly removed. However, {{the effects of the}} venom include only transient pain and mild swelling. In one part of Honduras the locals even insist that the snake (A. nummifer) is not venomous. Laboratory studies suggest that Atropoides venoms are unlikely to lead to consumption coagulopathy and incoagulable blood in humans. However, other research revealed that of ten different Costa Rican pit viper venoms tested on mice, that of A. picadoi was the most hemorrhagic.|$|E
25|$|Preparation of pu'erh {{involves}} first separating a well-sized {{portion of}} the compressed tea for brewing. This {{can be done by}} flaking off pieces of the cake or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft from heat and hydration. A pu'erh knife, which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid letter opener, is used <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as tuocha or mushroom pu'erh are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical sampling of the cake should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.|$|E

25|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} (Enhydra lutris) has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left side), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against the rock which it places on its chest. Furthermore, sea otters will use large stones <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> an abalone off its rock; they will hammer the abalone shell with observed rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds or 180 rpm, and do it in two or three dives. Releasing an abalone, which can cling to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its own body weight, requires multiple dives by the otter.|$|E

25|$|In his decade-long {{pursuit of}} an elusive title, Mike Thibault {{found himself in}} the proverbial hot seat to {{engineer}} a deep run. But an absence of urgency was reflected in the team's free agency approach – making small waves <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> Thompson and Cash from their respective teams – to solely ink rugged forward Mistie Mims in relief of Charles. Sticking with the status quo meant the roster was set {{so much so that the}} Sun drafted an unheralded Malian prospect. Going into the season, Thibault had assembled a deep roster that necessitated only a couple minor moves to cap the off-season process. The coach's patience paid dividends when his burgeoning core bolted to a 6–1 start highlighted by a chafed Montgomery turning the starting reins over to Hightower. Leading into the 1-month Olympic hiatus, the Sun strung together a five-win streak to improve to a league-best 15–4 mark. Following the ill-timed Games, which saw the club's Jones-Charles tandem help capture gold for Team USA, Connecticut continued to perform superbly while short-handed. They finished the season 25–9, with a better road record (13–4) than as hosts. The Sun fended off late Liberty rallies to sweep their way into a joust with the Fever in what was the team's first Conference finals since 2010's radical facelift. In the series, the Sun took themselves to the doorstep of a Finals berth after notching a decisive Game 1 rout. But building on a stirring two-point Game 2 win and a rally cry after losing Douglas, Indiana derailed the Sun's seemingly predestined trip in a 71–87 home romp, a defeat that essentially cost longtime coach Thibault his job. The lion's share of the season's fortunes came from the talented triumvirate of Lawson, Jones and league MVP Tina Charles flanked by Mims and sixth woman Montgomery carving a niche as an energy duo off the pines. Though failure was what came to mind in taking stock of the team's decade season; the Fever capturing the year's title being emblematic of that.|$|E
