5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{assembling}} NAD de novo {{from simple}} amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors {{used in these}} salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> reactions that consume NAD in this organelle. salvage pathway delays aging without altering steady-state NAD+ levels | journal = J.

5|$|Following the station's opening, Downtown Flushing {{evolved into}} a major {{commercial}} and transit center, as development sprung around the section of Main Street near the station. On April 24, 1939, express trains began operating {{to and from the}} station, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the Willets Point station for the 1939 World's Fair. Due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> passenger use, beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at the east end of the station, and the widening of existing staircases. A new eastern entrance was added after World War II. Ground broke on the new entrance on November 5, 1947, and it opened on October 28, 1948 with two new street stairs and an additional token booth. Upon its initial opening, the new entrance did little to relieve crowding at the main fare control area.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was Pomerania. It was also characterized by the most extensive contacts with the external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural richness and diversity. Pomerania was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as Wolin, Pyrzyce or Szczecin. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the Velunzani ("Uelunzani") and Pyritzans ("Prissani") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in Farther Pomeranian societies, except for the Wolin city-state.|$|E
5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E
5|$|Insect wing {{muscle is}} a {{strictly}} aerobic tissue. Per unit protein it consumes fuel and oxygen at rates {{taking place in}} a very concentrated and highly organized tissue so that the steady-state rates per unit volume represent an absolute record in biology. The fuel and oxygen rich blood is carried to the muscles through diffusion occurring in large amounts, {{in order to maintain}} <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> energy used during flight. Many wing muscles are large and may be as large as 10mm in length and 2mm in width. Moreover, in some Diptera the fibres are of giant dimensions. For instance, in the very active Rutilia, the cross-section is 1800µm long and more than 500µm wide. The transport of fuel and oxygen from the surroundings to the sites of consumption and the reverse transport of carbon dioxide therefore represent a challenge to the biologist both in relation to transport in the liquid phase and in the intricate system of air tubes, i.e. in the tracheal system.|$|E
