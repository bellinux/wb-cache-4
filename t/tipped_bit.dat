40|$|New {{developments}} in vibration analysis better explain machinery resonance, through {{an example of}} drill bit chattering during machining of rusted steel. The vibration of an operating drill motor was measured, the natural frequency of an attached spring was measured, and the two frequencies were compared {{to show that the}} system was resonant. For resonance to occur, one of the natural frequencies of a structural component must be excited by a cyclic force of the same frequency. In this case, the frequency of drill bit chattering due to motor rotation equaled the spring frequency (cycles per second), and the system was unstable. A soft rust coating on the steel to be drilled permitted chattering to start at the drill <b>bit</b> <b>tip,</b> and the <b>bit</b> oscillated on and off of the surface, which increased the wear rate of the drill bit. This resonant condition is typically referred to as a motor critical speed.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{laboratory tests}} {{to investigate the}} ease of frictional ingition with frozen (nonrotating) conical bits cutting into sandstone. The number of strikes with a new bit to obtain ignition of a combustible methane-air environment was measured. Tests were made with <b>bits</b> <b>tipped</b> with both tungsten carbide and steel at several bit attack angles (angle between bit axis and sandstone surface) and initial tip angles (included angle {{at the tip of}} the new bit). Carbide-tipped bits required more strikes for ingition than steel-tipped bits, by a factor of 7 to 10. With a carbide-tipped bit, the number of strikes for ingition increased by a factor of about 3 if the bit attack angle increased by 1020 or if the initial tip angle decreased by 1020. During use, abrasive wear of the frozen bit caused a flat surface to form at the <b>tip</b> of the <b>bit,</b> thereby decreasing the tip angle.

25|$|Installer bits are {{a type of}} {{twist drill}} bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. Installer bits are also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits.

The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.|$|R
2500|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} hammer drill, which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill <b>bit</b> <b>tip,</b> and the rotating flutes carry away the dust.

[...] Hammer drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the design}} of most {{ultrasonic}} drills, it is difficult to drill much past an inch into very dense material. This is {{because of the lack of}} slurry, or cutting fluid, to reach the drill bit in order to keep it clean and effective. Rotational drills do not experience this phenomenon as much due to the slotted cutting bit, which allows access of cutting fluid to the <b>tip</b> of the <b>bit.</b> Ultrasonic drilling provides very little tolerance surrounding the bit, and so no such pathway is created.|$|R

25|$|Tungsten carbide {{and other}} {{carbides}} are extremely hard and can drill virtually all materials, while holding an edge longer than other bits.

30|$|All rock preparation, measurement, and {{analysis}} {{were carried out}} in the rock mechanics laboratories, at the Department of Geological Sciences, University of Canterbury (Cant 2015). Samples were taken from core supplied by Mercury NZ Limited and Tauhara North No. 2 Trust. A drill press was used to extract 25 – 20  mm diameter cylinders from the core using a diamond <b>tipped</b> coring <b>bit.</b> The cylinders were all oriented parallel to the long axis of the core samples, making them approximately vertical within the stratigraphic column. A small piece of each cylinder was removed for thin section preparation for petrophysical analysis and void structure investigation. The cylinders were cut for a length-to-diameter ratio between 1 : 1.8 and 1 : 2.2, and ground flat for parallel ends as recommended by Ulusay and Hudson (2007) to allow for future unconfined compressive strength (UCS) testing. After coring and grinding the cylinders, they were placed in an ultrasonic bath with distilled water to clean and remove loose fractured material or clays formed during core drilling and grinding, then oven dried.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} {{ballistic}} well drilling and sometimes called [...] "spudders", these rigs raise and drop a drill string {{with a heavy}} carbide <b>tipped</b> drilling <b>bit</b> that chisels through the rock by finely pulverizing the subsurface materials. The drill string is composed of the upper drill rods, a set of [...] "jars" [...] (inter-locking [...] "sliders" [...] that help transmit additional energy to the drill bit and assist in removing the bit if it is stuck) and the drill bit. During the drilling process, the drill string is periodically removed from the borehole and a bailer is lowered to collect the drill cuttings (rock fragments, soil, etc.). The bailer is a bucket-like tool with a trapdoor in the base. If the borehole is dry, water is added so that the drill cuttings will flow into the bailer. When lifted, the trapdoor closes and the cuttings are then raised and removed. Since the drill string must be raised and lowered to advance the boring, the casing (larger diameter outer piping) is typically used to hold back upper soil materials and stabilize the borehole.|$|R
30|$|Generally, the “cutting” by {{the threads}} of {{increment}} bores produces no sawdust during coring. Apart from a “cutting” increment borer type, {{there is a}} “sawing” increment bore type, which utilizes a plug cutter instead of cutting edge at the <b>tip</b> of the <b>bit</b> [2]. The plug cutter produces sawdust (or splints) when coring. One of the main advantages of the sawing increment borer is its reduced friction {{on the outside of}} the drill compared to cutting increment borer. The sawing increment borer requires smaller torque for coring, and therefore is suited for sampling long cores of hardwood (e.g., “Dendrobohrer” by Pressler GmbH) [3]. The disadvantage is longer time required for coring.|$|R

Incendivity was eliminated for two radial designs. One conical design had ignition only after more than 15 impacts, but the other conical design was incendive. Impact failure occurred, but not so quickly as anticipated. Over 7, 500 impacts on a sandstone face, with a total cutting distance of more than 1, 981. 2 m, only scuffed the leading edge of the sintered diamond cutting face but put hairline cracks in the substrate mounting pad.

50|$|The USDC {{is driven}} by a Piezoelectric stack {{actuator}} that creates the vibrations. The actuator vibrates at an extremely high frequency, making it ultrasonic, and it is these waves of vibration that are transmitted by the horn of the actuator {{all the way to}} the bit itself. The vibrations are created at the actuator and are transferred by the horn to a free mass. The free mass vibrates between the drill stem and the horn of the actuator to transmit the vibrations down the drill stem. The drill stem houses the drill bit, and the vibrations push the bit into the material. The repetitive impact on the drill stem by the free mass, creates stress pulses that transmit to the <b>tip</b> of the <b>bit</b> and into the rock. Ultimately, the repetitive strike of the bit produces enough strain on the surface to fracture it.|$|R

The bits impacted blocks of Berea sandstone in a 6. 5 pet methane atmosphere at various bit speeds and cut depths. In a new condition, the plumb bob bits were considerably more incendive than the pencil bits, causing ignitions in 32 of 35 tests at 60 rpm, compared with ignitiolls in 2 of 22 tests for the pencil bits. The results from new bit testing also show that reduction of <b>bit</b> <b>tip</b> velocity to 180 fpm does not eliminate ignition potential.
