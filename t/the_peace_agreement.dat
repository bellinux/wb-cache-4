5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid that <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a guarantee of safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims. This would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though not happy, agreed to honor <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> were {{that no one}} would be enslaved, no harm would be done to the temples, nothing would be taken as booty and that safe passage was given to Thomas, Harbees, and every citizen of Damascus who was not willing to live under Muslim rule. <b>The</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> also stated that the peace would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E

During this period the country's economic performance remained modest, with a 5–7 percent GDP growth rate. However, the political stability and economic improvements, such as <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, were overshadowed by {{the onset of the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis.

5|$|In 572 the Byzantine ruler JustinII (reigned 565–578) {{refused to}} renew the annual {{payments}} to Sassanid Persia that {{had been part of}} <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> concluded by his uncle, JustinianI (r. 527–565) and the Persian shah KhosrauI (r. 531–579) in 562. This marked the culmination of the progressive deterioration of Byzantine–Persian relations over the previous years, which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery. Thus the Byzantines initiated contacts with the Central Asian Göktürks for a joint effort against Persia, while the Persians intervened in Yemen against the Christian Axumites, allies of Byzantium. Justin furthermore regarded the annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of Romans, and used the outbreak of a major revolt in Persian Armenia in 571–572 as a pretext for refusing to continue the payments.|$|E

5|$|In 927, a {{peace treaty}} had been signed between Bulgaria and Byzantium, ending many years of warfare and {{establishing}} forty years of peace. Both states prospered during this interlude, but {{the balance of power}} gradually shifted in favour of the Byzantines, who made great territorial gains against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East and formed a web of alliances surrounding Bulgaria. By 965/966, the warlike new Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas refused to renew the annual tribute that was part of <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> and declared war on Bulgaria. Preoccupied with his campaigns in the East, Nikephoros resolved to fight the war by proxy and invited the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav to invade Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} of Ombifotsy was ruled by Andriambahoakafovoanitany, {{who had a}} friendly relationship with Andriamasinavalona. The two agreed to a challenge: each would leave his palace simultaneously on a chosen Friday night, and walk toward the other's palace until the two met. They crossed paths at the Ombifotsy ("White Zebu") river, so named because the two sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug a trench along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement.

5|$|EdwardIII was {{not content}} with <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> made in his name, but the renewal of the war with Scotland {{originated}} in private, rather than royal initiative. A group of English magnates known as The Disinherited, who had lost land in Scotland by the peace accord, staged an invasion of Scotland and won a great victory at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332. They attempted to install Edward Balliol as king of Scotland in DavidII's place, but Balliol was soon expelled {{and was forced to}} seek the help of EdwardIII. The English king responded by laying siege to the important border town of Berwick and defeated a large relieving army at the Battle of Halidon Hill. Edward reinstated Balliol on the throne and received a substantial amount of land in southern Scotland. These victories proved hard to sustain, as forces loyal to DavidII gradually regained control of the country. In 1338, Edward was forced to agree to a truce with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter, Harald is {{reported}} in the sagas to have gone to Jerusalem and fought in battles in the area. Although the sagas place this after his expedition to Sicily, historian Kelly DeVries has questioned that chronology. Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place {{before or after the}} 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the Fatimid Caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah (in reality the Caliph's mother, originally a Byzantine Christian, since the Caliph was a minor), although it is considered unlikely to have been made before. Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem (possibly including members of the Imperial family) following <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement,</b> as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Furthermore, this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|In April 634, Abu Bakr {{invaded the}} Byzantine Empire in the Levant and decisively {{defeated}} a Byzantine army at the Battle of Ajnadayn. The Muslim armies marched north and laid siege to Damascus. The city was taken after a monophysite bishop informed Khalid ibn al-Walid, the Muslim commander in chief, {{that it was}} possible to breach city walls by attacking a position only lightly defended at night. While Khalid entered the city by assault from the Eastern gate, Thomas, commander of the Byzantine garrison, negotiated a peaceful surrender at the Jabiyah gate with Abu Ubaidah, Khalid's second in command. After the surrender of the city, the commanders disputed the terms of <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement.</b> The commanders finally agreed that the peace terms given by Abu Ubaidah would be met. The peace terms included an assurance that no pursuit will be undertaken by Muslims against the departing Roman convoy for three days. Having acquiesced to the peace terms, it was three days after the surrender of the city that Khalid set out after the Damascan refugees towards Antioch and defeated them in battle six days later, near present day Al Jayyad.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1209, {{after the}} Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders (r. 1205–16) quelled a revolt of the Lombard barons of Thessalonica {{and brought the}} Kingdom of Thessalonica under his {{effective}} control, Michael sent envoys to propose an alliance. Henry distrusted Michael's sincerity, but sent an embassy to Epirus with his terms, which amounted to Michael declaring himself a vassal of the Latin Empire. Michael was able to sidestep an outright declaration of submission by offering the hand of his eldest daughter to the Emperor's brother, Eustace, {{and a third of}} his lands as her dowry. Henry accepted, and <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> was sealed with the marriage of Eustace and Michael's daughter. Finally, in early 1210, Michael's envoys, the Bishop of Tzernikon Theodore and Symeon Kounales, met with the Venetian duke of Dyrrhachium, Marino Vallaresso, and negotiated a treaty, confirmed by oath on 20 June. Thereby Michael accepted to become a vassal of Venice, holding his lands in fief from Venice as confirmed in a charter issued by Doge Pietro Ziani (r. 1205–29). Michael granted the Venetians extensive trading privileges and tax exemptions, just as they had enjoyed under the chrysobulls of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–80), promised to expedite the grain exports to Venice, and to assist in any shipwreck of a Venetian vessel off the Epirote coast. In addition, as a sign of his vassalage he would pay to the Venetian duke of Dyrrhachium an annual tribute of 42 litrai of gold hyperpyra in two instalments, and send annually a rich brocade for the altar of St. Mark's Basilica and one for the Doge.|$|E

5|$|Muirchertach was {{skilled in}} diplomacy, and {{negotiation}} with the dowries {{of his daughters}} may {{have been part of}} a political game. While he may not have intended to honour his agreements with Magnus (or others), he needed the latter's assistance to crush Domnall. Magnus and Muirchertach went on joint raiding expeditions after <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>agreement,</b> only interrupted by the winter of 1102–03. The sagas claim that Magnus wintered in Connacht, but since Connacht is incorrectly claimed to be Muirchertach's kingdom the location was corrected to Kincora, Munster by modern historians. Rosemary Power considered it more likely that Magnus would have kept his fleet near Dublin. Magnus was probably allied with Muirchertach during his campaigns against Domnall and the Cenél nEógain in 1103, but (in contrast to the Norse sources) Irish sources (the Annals of Ulster and Annals of the Four Masters) do not describe their campaigns as successful. On 5 August 1103, Muirchertach unsuccessfully tried to subdue Domnall in the Battle of Mag Coba. Magnus did not take part, but his Dublin subjects fought with Muirchertach. Since Magnus was closing in on the Irish throne, Muirchertach may have wanted him out of the way. According to Morkinskinna and Heimskringla, the two agreed that Muirchertach was to bring Magnus and his men cattle provisions for their return to Norway; as this dragged on past the agreed time, Magnus became suspicious that the Irish planned an attack. He gathered his men on St. Bartholomew's Day (or the day before, according to Ágrip), 24 August 1103, and ventured into the country. It is possible that Magnus and his men made an incautious landing to raid cattle, or the Ulaid mistook the Norwegians for cattle-raiding Hebrideans. Alternatively, Muirchertach may have ordered the Ulaid to bring provisions to Magnus, inciting the Ulaid to ambush the Norwegians.|$|E
