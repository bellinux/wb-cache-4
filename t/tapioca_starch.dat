40|$|Fluid loss into {{formation}} {{is due to}} greater hydrostatic pressure exerted on the formation. This phenomenon may give severe drilling problems such as stuck pipe, formation damage and poor cementing job. Thus, the use of fluid loss control agent could reduce the tendency of fluid loss into formation. Currently, polyanionic cellulose (PAC) {{is one of the}} fluid loss control agents that are widely used to control fluid loss. Since the PAC has to be imported at a high price, thus {{there is a need to}} look for cheaper local materials to substitute PAC. This paper discusses the prospect of utilizing local starches, namely sago and tapioca, as fluid loss control agents in water-based mud. This discussion is based on the results derived from laboratory experiments. In this study, the performance of sago and <b>tapioca</b> <b>starches</b> were compared to PAC. Experimental results revealed that sago and <b>tapioca</b> <b>starches</b> could achieve the viscosity produced by PAC. For a given mud viscosity, it was found that sago mud could give comparable gel strength and yield point as compared to PAC mud. The significant advantage of utilizing sago mud was it could produce a thinner mud cake than PAC mud. Surprisingly, both samples were found to give comparable values of fluid loss. Based on this preliminary study, it could be concluded that local starches especially sago has the potential to be used as fluid loss control agent in drilling mud. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{estimate}} an effect of addition of different starches (potato, maize, waxy maize and tapioca) on the sensoric properties as well as selected physicochemical properties of set-style yoghurts. Sensoric evaluation comprised: colour, taste, smell, consistency and general appearance. pH value, titration acidity, degree of syneresis by centrifuge and FIL/IDF methods, content of acetaldehyde and diacetyl were also estimated. All analyses were done on fresh yoghurts and after 1 week and 3 weeks of storage at 4 °C. It was stated that natural (not supplemented with any starch) yoghurt and that fortified with waxy maize starch were characterized with the best sensoric properties. Moreover the latter one was found to maintain the highest acetaldehyde level after 3 weeks of storage. Also maize starch influenced higher level of this aromatic compound. Generally starch additives resulted also in lower acidity of yoghurts during the first period of cold storage. Products with maize and <b>tapioca</b> <b>starches</b> demonstrated th...|$|R
40|$|The {{disruption}} of molecular orders which occur during the gelatinisation of starch granules {{has been studied}} by isolating dried samples from maize, waxy maize, wheat, potato, and <b>tapioca</b> <b>starches</b> after defined thermal pre-treatments. Residual molecular and crystalline order was quantified by C- 13 -c. p. -m. a. s. -n. m. r. spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction, respectively, and the results compared with residual gelatinisation enthalpy determined by d. s. c. For native starches, molecular (double-helical) order was significantly greater than crystalline order. Molecular and crystalline order were both found to correlate with the residual enthalpy of gelatinisation following thermal pre-treatment, indicating that both levels of structure are disrupted concurrently during gelatinisation. From the data obtained, predicted enthalpy values for the {{disruption of}} fully ordered and crystalline analogues of the starches studied were calculated, and compared with values for essentially fully ordered and crystalline model material. This comparison suggests that the enthalpy of gelatinisation primarily reflects the loss of molecular (double-helical) order...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} modify the {{properties}} of native starch granules, the formation of gelatinized granular forms (GGS) from normal, waxy, and high amylose maize, as well as potato and <b>tapioca</b> <b>starches</b> was investigated by treating granules with aqueous ethanol at varying starch:water:ethanol ratios and then heating in a rotary evaporator to remove ethanol. The modified starches were characterized using bright field, polarized and electron microscopy. Short/long range molecular order and enthalpic transitions on heating were also studied using infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry respectively. A diffuse birefringence pattern without Maltese cross was observed for most GGS samples. Treatment with aqueous ethanol resulted in starch-specific changes in the surface of granules, most noticeably swelling and disintegration in waxy maize, surface wrinkling in normal maize and tapioca, swelling and opening-up in potato starches, and swelling and bursting in high amylose maize. The ratio of ethanol to water at which original granular order was disrupted also varied with starch type. GGS had less short range molecular order than native granules as inferred by comparing 1047 / 1022 wave number ratio from infrared spectroscopy. Similarly, A- and B-type diffraction reflections were either reduced or completely lost with evolution of V-type patterns in GGS...|$|R
