5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin,</b> and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
5|$|A <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} {{the ball at}} a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E

50|$|Since color-blocking is an {{abstract}} form of art, {{it is easy}} to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner.</b> Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.|$|R
50|$|A <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner</b> {{shape of}} pot, {{suitable}} for deep-rooting plants, {{was known as}} a long tom, a term still used. The traditional size for a long tom used for auriculas was 3 in diameter by 3.75 to 4 in depth.|$|R

25|$|Soon {{after the}} three {{land on the}} strange planet, Ransom gets his chance to run off into the unknown landscape, just after he sees the Sorns—tall alien creatures who terrify him. Ransom wanders around, finding many {{differences}} between Earth and Malacandra, in that all the lakes, streams, and rivers are warm; the gravity is significantly less; and the plants and mountains are strangely <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{limited edition}} of Brotherhood by The Chemical Brothers {{came in a}} {{cardboard}} box of a similar size to a jewel case but slightly <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner.</b> The box can be opened from the right to reveal both CDs packaged in cardboard cases, along with the booklet and a postcard.|$|R
50|$|Gnomes {{come from}} all kinds of mythology. They were {{traditionally}} a small and plump race of jolly men who had beards and pointed caps. The early editions of D&D reflected this stereotype, but later versions began using a variant of gnome that was slightly <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner,</b> with slanted eyes and a talent for machinery.|$|R
5000|$|Taxus media var. hicksii (also {{known by}} the common name Hicks's yew or alternately, Hicks yew) is a common {{cultivar}} of this hybrid, <b>and</b> is the <b>tallest</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinnest</b> variety of T. media, limiting itself to a 4 foot (1.3 meter) diameter despite the fact it can achieve a height of close to 20 feet.|$|R
25|$|Pillar Rock {{is a large}} {{rocky outcrop}} {{surrounded}} by cliffs on the northern side of Pillar, well below the summit. When seen from Ennerdale {{it looks like a}} <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> column, hence its name. In the early 19th century it became widely {{known as one of the}} wonders of the Lake District, chiefly due to its featuring in William Wordsworth's poem The Brothers.|$|E
25|$|Albus Dumbledore was <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin,</b> {{with silver}} hair and beard (auburn in his youth) {{so long that}} they could be tucked into his belt. He had a very long and crooked nose that {{looked as if it had}} been broken at least twice. (It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may have played a role in shaping his nose.) He was also said to have had long and {{skillful}} fingers. His eyes were described to be a brilliant, soul-piercing shade of blue, and usually twinkled with kindness and mischief.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probable}} that Xingxiulong would have had more than the 35 preserved caudal vertebrae in the tail. These vertebrae are overall tall and very robust, and have concave sides like other basal sauropodomorphs. They also all appear to be amphicoelous. The transverse processes of the first several caudal vertebrae are wide and flat, and directed upwards and outwards; the transverse processes of caudal vertebrae further back in the tail are more slender and horizontal. As for the neural spines, they are <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin,</b> and are directed somewhat backwards.|$|E
60|$|One misnamed {{lady was}} a Miss Mist, who, {{instead of being}} light, airy, and ethereal, as she ought to have been, weighed at least twelve stone six. But she sang divinely, was a great {{favourite}} with the young people on board, {{and would have been}} very much missed indeed if she had not been there. There was also a Mr Stout, who was the <b>tallest</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinnest</b> man in the ship.|$|R

25|$|IGM 250816: Found in the Duke 57 {{locality}} in Villavieja Formation; {{consists of}} a right premaxilla {{and part of the}} maxilla, the front left tooth, part of the dorsal border of a rostrum and two vertebrae. The premaxillary measured 12.8cm in length, is <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> compared to the S. icaeorhinus being covered with fine grooves on its outer surface. It has three dental alveoli in the premaxilla, {{from the edge of the}} second tooth to the fourth, which is particularly enlarged, being twice the third (reverse that in S. icaeorhinus), while the first two teeth should be small. After the fourth premaxillary tooth there is a space or diastema in that fitted the fourth lower tooth that exceeded the 3.5 centimeters; has a narrow palate, lateral nasal aperture and without mild depression around. The dentary is high, with four sockets, two projecting forward and a third and fourth straight, the latter being the largest. The associated vertebrae are an amphycoelian sacral with a sacral rib attached, with a wide, rectangular neural spine; it measured 10.7cm high by 5.5cm wide, while it is estimated that the sacral ribs should be 10cm wide at its rear end. The other is an anterior caudal vertebrae, perhaps the first, with incomplete neural spine, with a broad neural canal, and measures 2.8cm wide and 2.1 high.|$|E
500|$|Kurtzman {{lettered}} {{the dialogue}} in an expressive, handwriting-like style. [...] Unlike {{as in the}} majority of American comic books, Kurtzman did not letter using all capitals. [...] His <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> dialogue balloons necessitated frequent hyphenation, which makes the dialogue more difficult to read. [...] Kurtzman experimented with drawing on blue-lined paper; the blue lines were not supposed to reproduce visibly when the book was printed, but the gray wash Kurtzman used unintentionally reinforced them.|$|E
500|$|Trumble was <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin,</b> [...] in height. His {{long face}} {{featured}} prominent ears {{and a large}} nose, while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling. The cricket writer Ray Robinson said of Trumble: [...] "El Greco, with his lengthening touch {{would have liked to}} draw Trumble. Hugh's lantern shaped head set on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start." [...] English cricketer and author Plum Warner called him [...] "That great camel, Hughie Trumble." ...|$|E
5000|$|In James S.A. Corey's Expanse series, Ceres is {{the largest}} colony in the {{asteroid}} belt, housing six million people. Ceres' rotational speed had been artificially increased prior {{to the events of}} the novels, providing its inhabitants with a weak artificial gravity. Inhabitants of Ceres, and the asteroid belt in general, are referred to as [...] "Belters" [...] <b>and</b> are much <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner</b> than the inhabitants of the inner planets due to the low gravity.|$|R
5000|$|The cover art {{shows the}} {{silhouette}} of a girl - used throughout the book's illustrations to represent Charlotte - in a coffin with a banner saying [...] "Rest in Popularity". The title [...] "ghostgirl" [...] is the name used to refer to Charlotte after her death. The book is unusual in that the pages' proportion of height to width is much larger than usual, making it <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner</b> than most novels.|$|R
50|$|Githzerai {{resemble}} humans, but {{are slightly}} <b>taller</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner.</b> Their features are sharper, their faces are longer, {{and their eyes}} range from gray to a catlike yellow color. They stand a little over six feet <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> weigh approximately 160 pounds. Their skin is rough and yellow (occasionally shading to brown or green) and their hair is russet, although males commonly shave their heads or retain only a single braid in back, with carefully controlled facial hair. Females often keep their hair in tight buns or braids. Their ears are pointed.|$|R
500|$|Because the Slender Man's fictional [...] "mythology" [...] {{has evolved}} without an {{official}} [...] "canon" [...] for reference, his appearance, motives, habits, and abilities are not fixed, but change {{depending on the}} storyteller. He is most commonly described as very <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> with unnaturally long, tentacle-like arms (or merely tentacles), which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. In most stories his face is white and featureless, but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone who sees it. He appears to be wearing a dark suit and tie. The Slender Man {{is often associated with}} the forest and/or abandoned locations and has the ability to teleport. Proximity to the Slender Man is often said to trigger a [...] "Slender sickness"; a rapid onset of paranoia, nightmares and delusions accompanied by nosebleeds.|$|E
500|$|Isopogon anethifolius is a shrub usually between [...] {{high with}} an upright habit (<b>tall</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> with mostly {{vertical}} stems). It generally grows taller in more sheltered {{areas such as}} woodlands, and shorter in more exposed areas. The stems are reddish in colour, and new growth in winter is tinged with reddish and tan tones. The leaves are terete (round in cross section) and less than 1mm (in) in diameter. They branch once or twice in their [...] length. The globular yellow flowerheads, known as inflorescences, appear {{at the ends of}} branches in spring and early summer (September to December), though occasionally at other times of year. These are up to [...] in diameter. The individual flowers arise out of the central woody globe in a spiral pattern, and are around [...] long. They are straight stalkless structures that originate from a scale on the globe, composed of a tubular structure known as the perianth, which envelopes the flower's sexual organs. The perianth splits into four segments, revealing a thin delicate style that is tipped with the stigma. At the ends of the four perianth segments are the male pollen-bearing structures known as anthers. [...] Arranged in a spiral pattern, the flowers open from the outer/bottom of the flowerhead inwards. The egg-shaped grey cones are revealed as the old flower parts fall away, and are up to 2.5cm (1in) in diameter. The seed-bearing nuts are small—up to [...] across—and lined with hairs. The seed weighs around [...]|$|E
