In such substances, the domain walls are pinned by (usually dipole) defects, which are present also in ordered samples as technologically <b>unavoidable</b> <b>impurities.</b> This random interaction with dipole pinning centers results, in particular, in exponentially broad distribution of switching times. Under supposition of low pinning centers concentration, we derive the distribution function of switching times showing {{that it is}} not simply Lorentzian (as it was first suggested by Tagantsev et al [, 66, 214109 (2002) ]), but is a "square of Lorentzian", which is due to the vector nature of electric field.

The cooling of high energy (≃ 15 - 20 GeV) protons requires a high electron beam current (≃ few amperes) with low emittances (< 4 π mm mrad normalized) to reach reasonable cooling times of < 10 min. For this purpose a linac-based scheme including recirculator and magnetized cooling section has been considered. In this scheme short electron bunches are accelerated in rf-fields.

The acicular Al 3 Fe and β-Al 5 FeSi (or Al 9 Si 2 Fe 2) are common iron-containing intermetallic compounds (IMCs) in conventional structure which have a detrimental impact on the mechanical properties. In this paper, ultrasonic field (USF) was applied to modify acicular iron phases in Al- 12 %Si- 2 %Fe and Al- 2 %Fe alloys.

In the case of Al-Si-Fe alloys, ultrasonic treatment led to both morphological and compositional conversion of the ternary iron IMCs. When the USF was applied, the acicular β-Al 9 Si 2 Fe 2 was substituted by star-like α-Al 12 Si 2 Fe 3.

40|$|Superfluid 3 He has {{important}} implications in studying condensed matter physics, specifically in its phases at very low temperatures. The understanding of these phases not only expands our knowledge of 3 He itself, but is also a paradigm for recently discovered unconventional superconductors such as strontium ruthenate (SrRuO 3) and uranium platinum three (UPt 3). Superfluid 3 He’s relation to superconductors is not in its pure form, but in dirty superfluid 3 He, where impurities from external sources are present. This is because real superconductors, unlike ideal ones, contain <b>unavoidable</b> <b>impurities.</b> In 3 He, however, we can control the number of impurities {{and how they are}} distributed in space. These impurities are introduced by filling the extremely porous structure of silica aerogel with 3 He.

In 2005, the German Stiftung Warentest (a product testing NGO) had detected high levels of PAHs in some tool handles and cable sheaths [1]. To reduce the health risks, guidance values for <b>technically</b> <b>unavoidable</b> PAH levels were proposed for manufacturers to comply on a voluntary basis. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to assess these guidance values and the occurrence of PAHs in consumer products. In the spring of 2009 TÜV Rheinland examined the PAH concentrations in various products like tool handles, beach sandals and ball horns from do-it-yourself stores and low budget stores. The result: {{in some cases the}} guidance values are still considerably exceeded in the consumer products examined for PAHs. According to the knowledge currently available, the BfR must assume that defective products are still being marketed. Such products do not comply with good manufacturing practice and constitute a risk for human health. In general, manufacturers should reduce PAH concentrations in their products as much as possible since no threshold values can be given for some PAHs below which health risks can be excluded.

40|$|In {{the nearly}} two decades since they were first commercialized, genetically {{engineered}} crops have gained ground on their conventional counterparts, reaching nearly 180 million hectares worldwide in 2015. The technology has bestowed most of its benefits on enhancing crop productivity with two main traits currently dominating the market: insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are conventionally obtained through the introduction of foreign DNA fragments into the host genome via genetically engineering techniques. The modified organism, i. e. plant, will {{then be able to}} express new protein(s) confering it with the novel, desired trait(s), e. g. herbicide tolerance. Plants such as maize and soybean have been modified to withstand weed-killing chemicals or resist insect pests to increase yields and improve profits to farmers. Despite their rapid and vast adoption by farmers worldwide, GMOs have generated heated debates, especially in European countries, driven mostly by consumers concerned about safety of transgenic foods and about the potential impact of their release into the environment. The European Union (EU) has established the mandatory labeling of GMOs in food and feed above a certain threshold (0. 9 %, based on the ingredient). In the list of ingredients the term "genetically modified" must appear (next to the ingredient in question).

40|$|Aspects of the {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of C 60 n- fulleride ions (n = 2, 3) and the EPR signal observed in solid C 60 are reinterpreted. Insufficient levels of reduction and the unrecognized presence of C 120 O, a ubiquitous and <b>unavoidable</b> <b>impurity</b> in air-exposed C 60, have compromised most previously reported spectra of fullerides. Central narrow line width signals ("spikes") are ascribed to C 120 O n- (n = odd). Signals arising from axial triplets (g ∼ 2. 0015, D = 26 - 29 G) in the spectrum of C 60 2 - are ascribed to C 120 O n- (n = 2 or 4). Their D values are more realistic for C 120 O than C 60. Less distinct signals from "powder" triplets (D ∼ 11 G) are ascribed to aggregates of C 120 O n- (n = odd) arising from freezing nonglassing solvents. In highly purified samples of C 60, we find no evidence for a broad ∼ 30 G signal previously assigned to a thermally accessible triplet of C 60 2 -. The C 60 2 - ion is EPR-silent. Signals previously ascribed to a quartet state of the C 60 3 - ion are ascribed to C 120 O 4 -. Uncomplicated, authentic spectra of C 60 - and C 60 3 - become available when fully reduced samples are prepared under strictly anaerobic conditions from freshly HPLC-purified C 60. Solid off-the-shelf C 60 has an EPR signal (g∼ 2. 0025, AH pp ∼ 1. 5 G) that is commonly ascribed to the radical cation C 60. +. This signal can be reproduced by exposing highly purified, EPR-silent C 60 to oxygen in the dark. Doping C 60 with an authentic C 60. + 6 salt gives a signal with much greater line width (AHpp = 6 - 8 G). It is suggested that the EPR signal in air-exposed samples of C 60 arises from a peroxide-bridged diradical, •C 60 -O-O-C 60. or its decomposition products rather than from C 60. +. Solid-state C 60 is more sensitive to oxygen than previously appreciated such that contamination with C 120 O {{is almost impossible to}} avoid...|$|R

However, in experiments {{it was observed}} that metal impurities limit the lifetime in n-type multicrystalline (mc) silicon even if high purity feedstock was used. By evaluating Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and Inducitvely Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) at blocks grown with high purity feedstock, we identified the main currently <b>unavoidable</b> metal <b>impurities</b> present in n-type mc silicon. In addition, we measured the charge carrier lifetime on surface-passivated wafers after different solar cell processes. The measurements were compared to simulations in order to identify the limitations by different impurities and to evaluate the influence of metal precipitates. We found that Cr i is an important defect in good grains of as-grown wafers. Dissolved Co can have a severe impact on lifetime after process steps with fast coo ling. The lower lifetime in the edge region of the blocks is attributed to FeSi 2 precipitates, which explains the poor gettering response of the edge region in contrast to grains in the block center. From the results obtained for FeSi 2 -precipitates, we concluded that Cu 3 Si- and NiSi 2 -precipitates located at crystal defects may be responsible for significant recombination in the block center...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{analysis}} has become important to assess conditions and take decisions on control procedures. In this context {{it is considered}} a prerequisite {{in the evaluation of}} GM food. Many consumers worldwide worry that food derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) may be unhealthy and hence regulations on GMO authorisations and labelling have become more stringent. Nowadays there is a higher demand for non-GM products and these products could be differentiated from GM products using the identity preservation system (IP) that could apply throughout the grain processing system. IP is the creation of a transparent communication system that encompasses HACCP, traceability and related systems in the supply chain. This process guarantees that certain characteristics of the lots of food (non-GM origin) are maintained “from farm to fork”. This article examines the steps taken by the Hellenic Food Safety Authority to examine the presence of GMOs in foods. The whole integrated European legislation framework currently in place still needs to be implemented in Greece. Penalties should be enforced to those who import, process GMOs without special licence and do not label those products. Similar penalties should be enforced to those companies that issue false certificates beyond the liabilities taken by the food enterprises for farmers’ compensation. We argue that Greece has no serious reasons to choose the use of GMOs {{due to the fact that}} the structural and pedologic characteristics of the Greek agriculture favour the biological and integrated cultivation more. Greece is not in favour of the politics behind coexistence of conventional and GM plants and objects to the use of GMOs in the food and the environment because the processor has a big burden in terms of money, time and will suffer a great deal in order to prove that their products are GMO free or that any contamination is adventitious or <b>technically</b> <b>unavoidable.</b> Moreover, Greece owns a large variety of genetic material that should try to protect from patenting and commercialisation. Finally, we should be aware of the requirements of movement of GMOs within borders, i. e. GMOs grown or used in other countries but which are not intended to cross into Greece, since Greece is very close to countries that are non-EU. This is where the development of a new, integrated, trustworthy and transparent food quality control system will help to satisfy the societal demands for safe and quality products. On the other hand, Greece should not be isolated from any recent scientific technological development and should assess the possible advantages for some cultivation using a case by case approach. Finally, the safety assessment of GM foods and feed has been discussed according to the risk assessment methodology applied by EFSA...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{introduction}} of GM crops and GM seeds in agricultural production in the EU and elsewhere has {{raised the issue of}} adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional seed lots. Article 21 (2) of Directive 2001 / 18 /EC provides that for products where adventitious or <b>technically</b> <b>unavoidable</b> traces of authorised GMOs cannot be excluded, a minimum threshold may be established below which the products shall not have to be labelled in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. In the absence of such thresholds, which is the current status of seed production, the legislation requires the labelling of conventional seed lots which contain any detectable adventitious traces of GM seeds (which have been authorised for cultivation under Community legislation) (Directive 2001 / 18 /EC). The legal requirement is not new and has been in place since labelling provisions were introduced under Directive 90 / 220 /EEC and maintained under Directive 2001 / 18 /EC (which replaced Directive 90 / 220 /EEC). It remains illegal to place on the market conventional seed lots that contain GM seeds that have not been approved for cultivation. This has been the case since Directive 90 / 220 /EEC entered into force in 1991. The Commission is currently examining the possibility to establish thresholds and the impact associated with {{the introduction}} of different threshold values, as regards to agronomic (technical) feasibility of production and to economic impacts for seed producers, farmers, food and feed producers, and the necessary freedom of choice between genetically modified, conventional and organic crops. In this context, understanding the current status and likely evolution of crop and seed production in the EU is necessary as a basis to carry any further assessment {{of the effects of the}} regulation of adventitious GM presence in seeds. Understanding the likely distribution of GM commercial crop and GM seed production in the EU is also important when looking at the adventitious presence of GM material in conventional seeds. Data on the likely adoption and regional distribution of GM crops in the EU for short-medium term could be significant for this purpose. The aim of this study is to gather basic information/data on the EU crop and seed production for a number of crops. The crops under considerations are maize, sugar beet/fodder beet, cotton, oilseed rape, soybean and potato. Data will refer to conventional, GM and organic varieties. With respect to seed production, in the present study (given the time constraint) the attention will be focused on certified seeds. Also the study will focus on commercial seed production, therefore excluding farm saved seeds from the analysis. Given these premises, the study's objectives entail: ¿	Collection of data on volume, acreage and trade of crops in EU 25 and major trading partners (e. g. U. S.) and identification and analysis of main changes over time and analysis of future developments. ¿	 Collection of data on volume, acreage and trade of certified seed production in relevant Member States, analysis of main changes over time and identification of main future developments in key MS. ¿	Identification of main seed producing regions in the EU and collection of information/data relative to the potential adoption by farmers of GM varieties of the above mentioned crops in these regions.

40|$|Finding {{an ideal}} {{photocatalyst}} for achieving efficient overall water splitting still remains a great challenge. By applying accurate first-principles quantum calculations based on DFT with the screened non-local hybrid HSE 06 functional, we bring rational insights at the atomic level into {{the influence of}} non-stoichiometric compositions on essential properties of tantalum (oxy) nitride compounds as visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for water splitting. Indeed, recent experiments show that such non-stoichiometry is inherent to the nitridation methods of tantalum oxide with <b>unavoidable</b> oxygen <b>impurities.</b> We considered here O-enriched Ta 3 N 5 and N-enriched TaON materials. Although their structural parameters {{are found to be}} very similar to those of pure compounds and in good agreement with available experimental studies, their photocatalytic features for visible-light-driven overall water splitting reactions show different behaviors. Further partial nitration of TaON leads to a narrowed band gap, but partially oxidizing Ta 3 N 5 causes only subtle changes in the gap. The main influence, however, is on the band edge positions relative to water redox potentials. The pure Ta 3 N 5 is predicted to be a good candidate only for H+ reduction and H- 2 evolution, while the pure TaON is predicted to be a good candidate for water oxidation and O- 2 evolution. Non-stoichiometry has here a positive influence, since partially oxidized tantalum nitride, Ta(3 -x) N(5 - 5 x) O 5 x (for x >= 0. 16) i. e. with a composition in between TaON and Ta 3 N 5, reveals suitable band edge positions that correctly bracket the water redox potentials for visible-light-driven overall water splitting reactions. Among the various explored Ta(3 -x) N(5 - 5 x) O 5 x structures, a strong stabilization is obtained for the configuration displaying a strong interaction between the O-impurities and the created Ta-vacancies. In the lowest-energy structure, each created Ta-vacancy is surrounded by five O-impurity species substituting the five N sites characterizing one octahedral environment...|$|R

30|$|Citric acid (CA, C 6 H 8 O 7) is an {{important}} substance used mainly in the pharmaceutical and food industries, {{as well as in}} detergents and cleaning products, cosmetics and toiletries (Soccol et al. 2006). In addition, CA is believed to affect the formation of human bones by adsorbing in both the reacting and the producing phases of calcium ions; therefore, there is a large interest in the synthesis of calcium phosphates in the presence of CA (Brecevic and Füredi-Milhofer 1979; Rhee and Tanaka 1999; Misra 1996; Weng et al. 2002; de Leeuw and Rabone 2007; Chang et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2014; Skwarek et al. 2014; Iafisco et al. 2015; Kaygili et al. 2015). Some of these investigations are mentioned in the chronological order as follows. Misra (1996) published a report related to the interaction of CA with synthetic HAp and investigated the surface exchange of ions and precipitation of calcium citrate on HAp. Weng et al. (2002) investigated the effect of CA addition on the gelation mechanism in HAp synthesized via the sol–gel route. Leeuw and Rabone investigated the effects of the adsorption of CA to two specific surfaces of HAp using molecular dynamic simulations. CA was found to attach to all surfaces of HAp crystals and inhibited their growth but in various extents (de Leeuw and Rabone 2007). The influence of CA on the formation, purity and particle size distribution of HAp was studied by Chang et al. The authors discovered that the content of CaO as an <b>unavoidable</b> major <b>impurity</b> was reduced due to the addition of CA (Chang et al. 2011). Sun et al. (2014) showed that the CA-based polymer/hydroxyapatite composite scaffolds improved the repair of rat calvarial defects. Skwarek et al. (2014) published a study related to the adsorbtion of citrate ions on HAp samples prepared by three different methods. Iafisco et al. (2015) discovered that CA and citrates played a key dual role in the apatite crystallization: driving a growth pathway via an amorphous precursor and controlling the size of nanocrystals by the non-classical oriented aggregation mechanism. Additionally, the effects of the CA addition in different amounts (0, 2, 4 and 6  ml) on the structural and dielectric properties of HAp samples prepared in acidic conditions (pH 2) were studied (Kaygili et al. 2015). Furthermore, citrates were found to stabilize both the shape and dimensions of biological apatite crystals in bones (Xie and Nancollas 2010; Hu et al. 2010). All the aforementioned clearly indicates to the complexity of interactions between HAp and CA and the necessity of further experimental investigations.|$|R
