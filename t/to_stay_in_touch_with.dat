5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{suffrage}} and publishing work, Gordon was well-known in California political circles, and even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871. This positioned her, along with fellow suffragette Clara Shortridge Foltz, to manage the lobbying campaign for the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which granted women the right to practice law in California in January 1878. Gordon used her position as a journalist covering the debate <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> lawmakers and lobby the governor for the final signature.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's first match {{after the}} final was against Arsenal, a match the club needed to win <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the top four. Two goals from Robin van Persie, after Liverpool had scored {{in the first half}} meant that Liverpool lost 2–1 and were 10 points behind the team in 4th place, which would ensure {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Liverpool's league form continued to falter {{after the final}}; they won four of their last thirteen matches and ended the season in eighth place. Despite their poor league form, Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup against Chelsea. But they were unable to win a second trophy and lost 2–1. Cardiff played West Ham United in their first match after the final, which they lost 2–0. Despite the loss, they only needed to win one more in their remaining thirteen matches to finish in 6th place and qualify for the Championship playoffs. They faced third placed West Ham United, in the playoffs, which were contested over two-legs, with one at each team's home ground. Cardiff were unable to secure a second Wembley final, as West Ham United won 5–0 on aggregate.|$|E

25|$|UE’s {{policy on}} {{salaries}} is {{deeply rooted in}} UE’s philosophy of unionism. UE sees unionism as a movement and unions as independent organizations of workers. When union leaders {{live in the same}} income bracket as rank-and-file workers, it helps them <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the outlook and needs of workers. In UE's view, salaries for union officers and staff that are comparable to those of corporate executives tend to undermine a union’s commitment to its fundamental purpose.|$|E

25|$|The {{attempt to}} prove that Hitler had a fully {{developed}} psychosis in a clinical sense has only occasionally been made. An example is the book Hitler, Steiner, Schreber (1966) by the Freiburg psychiatrist Wolfgang Treher. Treher explains that both Rudolf Steiner (whose anthroposophy he attributes to mental illness) and Hitler suffered from schizophrenia. He writes that both managed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> reality because they {{had the opportunity to}} create their own organizations (Steiner: the Anthroposophical Society; Hitler: the NSDAP and its many subdivisions) that they could influence according to their delusions – and therefore avoid the, normally expected, “schizophrenic withdrawal”. Treher finds that Hitler’s megalomania and paranoia are quite striking.|$|E

25|$|A two-year Massey University {{survey of}} 30,000 people, {{published}} in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results {{were consistent with}} those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> their culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills. Further Auckland University of Technology research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.|$|E
25|$|Although Alexander was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right, he worked to avoid this and ultimately did not face a high-profile challenger. He declared his intention to run early, quickly won the endorsement of Governor Bill Haslam, every living former Tennessee Republican Party Chairman and the state's entire Republican congressional delegation (except scandal-hit Scott DesJarlais). He also raised {{a large amount of}} money and worked to avoid the mistakes of ousted Senators Bob Bennett and Richard Lugar by trying <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> his constituents, especially in East Tennessee. Moreover, out-of-state conservative organizations such as the Senate Conservatives Fund made little effort to defeat Alexander.|$|E

On 31 October 1944 the squadron destroyed the Gestapo headquarters at Aarhus, destroying German intelligence records about Resistance activities. In February 1945, in order <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the advancing Allied armies, the squadron shifted its base to liberated Europe, moving to Rosières-en-Santerre in France.

He could not repeat his successes {{of the last few}} years in the spring classics with his best result being a 7th at La Flèche Wallonne. He won the Klasika Primavera and the Volta a Catalunya to put those disappointments behind him. With the threat of not racing the Tour de France hanging over his head he entered the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré hoping to prove his worth. He performed consistently throughout the two early time-trials <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> the leaders before finishing second on Mont Ventoux {{to take the lead in}} the overall classification. Though Cadel Evans repeatedly attacked him in the final days he stayed on his wheel, with the help of compatriot Alberto Contador, to take the yellow jersey. On the back of these successes he appealed his ban by the Italian authorities with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the hope of racing the tour.|$|E

500|$|While he {{was waiting}} for his paper to be published, O'Neill {{organized}} a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton to discuss the possibility of colonizing outer space. The conference, titled First Conference on Space Colonization, was funded by Stewart Brand's Point Foundation and Princeton University. Among those who attended were Eric Drexler (at the time a freshman at MIT), scientist-astronaut Joe Allen (from Astronaut Group 6), Freeman Dyson, and science reporter Walter Sullivan. Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on the planned Space Shuttle. O'Neill thought of the attendees as [...] "a band of daring radicals". Sullivan's article on the conference was published {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on May 13, 1974. As media coverage grew, O'Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space. <b>To</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> them, O'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress. A few months later he heard Peter Glaser speak about solar power satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

According to O'Neill, [...] "the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth".|$|E

Five minutes into the race, Oxford, with a third of a length lead, were warned again by the umpire and moved away from the racing line, and following a series of oar clashes, allowed Cambridge to take the lead, shooting Hammersmith Bridge a second ahead. Oxford continued <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> Cambridge along the long middle bend of the course, towards the Chiswick Steps, and retook the lead on the approach to Barnes Bridge as the course curved back in their favour. With a three-quarter length lead at Barnes, Oxford began to weaken and Cambridge recovered to a third of a length.
