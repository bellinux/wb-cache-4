500|$|In May 2000, {{challenged}} by a skeptical U.S. News & World Report magazine article, the AP team did additional archival research, {{and reported that}} one of nine ex-soldiers quoted in the original No Gun Ri article, Edward L. Daily, had incorrectly identified himself as an eyewitness, and instead had been passing on second-hand information. A Pentagon spokesman said that this would not affect the Army's No Gun Ri investigation, noting Daily was [...] "just one guy of many we've been talking to". Army officer Robert Bateman, a 7th Cavalry veteran, who collaborated on the U.S. News & World Report article with a fellow 7th Cavalry association member, also published a book, , repeating his contentions that the AP reporting was flawed. The AP's methods and conclusions were defended by <b>the</b> <b>AP</b> <b>in</b> a lengthy, detailed refutation and by others.

[...] When the mother of Franklin's secretary, Missy LeHand, died in October 1932, Eleanor invited Hickok to accompany her to Potsdam, New York for the funeral. The women spent the long train ride talking, beginning a long friendship. By Franklin's inauguration on March 4, 1933, Hickok had become Eleanor's closest friend. The two made trips together to Albany and Washington, D.C., and spent nearly every day in each other's company. Hickok joined the Roosevelts every Sunday night for dinner, while on other nights Eleanor joined Hickok at the theater or opera, or at dinners alone at Hickok's apartment. For the inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her.|$|E
