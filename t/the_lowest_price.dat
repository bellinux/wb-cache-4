5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>price</b> anomaly, which implies higher returns to stocks with a <b>low</b> nominal <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> research aims to broaden academic knowledge in a few ways. Firstly, we deliver some fresh evidence on <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect from <b>the</b> Polish market. Secondly, we analyze the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect and other return factors: value, size and liquidity. Thirdly, we investigate whether <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect is present after accounting for liquidity. Fourthly, we check to see whether <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect is robust to transaction costs. The {{paper is composed of}} three main sections. In the beginning, we review the existing literature. Next, we present the data sources and research methods employed. Finally, we discuss our research findings. Our computations are based on all the stocks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) in the years 2003 - 2013. We have concluded that <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect is present on the Polish market, although the statistical significance is very weak and it disappears entirely after accounting for transaction costs and liquidity...|$|R

25|$|In practice, the {{segmentation}} approach {{relies on}} adequate fences between consumers {{so that everyone}} doesn't buy at <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> offered. The airlines use time of purchase to create this segmentation, with later booking customers paying the higher fares. The fashion industry uses time in the opposite direction, discounting later in the selling season once the item is out of fashion or inappropriate for the time of year. Other approaches to fences involve attributes that create substantial value to the consumer at little or no cost to the seller. A backstage pass at a concert {{is a good example}} of this. Initially yield management avoided the complexity caused by the interaction of absolute price and price position by using surrogates for price such as booking class. By the mid-1990s, most implementation incorporated some measures of price elasticity. The airlines were exceptional in this case, preferring to focus on more detailed segmentation by implementing O (Origin & Destination) systems.|$|E
25|$|The sales {{breakdown}} of the Macintosh have seen sales of desktop Macs stayed mostly constant while being surpassed by that of Mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably; seven out of ten Macs sold were laptops in 2009, a ratio projected to rise to {{three out of four}} by 2010. The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable (iMac G3) to upscale (iMac G4) and subsequent releases are considered premium all-in-ones. By contrast the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> of entry to a Mac, {{with the exception of the}} even more inexpensive Mac Mini (the only sub-$1000 offering from Apple, albeit without a monitor and keyboard), not surprisingly the MacBooks are the top-selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today.

500|$|Currently {{as many as}} 50,000 {{visitors}} {{gather on}} the last Wednesday in July to watch mounted riders bring the Virginia herd from Assateague and swim them across the channel to Chincoteague Island. The swim takes five-ten minutes, with both the rider and the observers on hand to assist horses, especially foals, who may {{have a hard time}} with the crossing. Before the swim, the herd is evaluated and mares in the late stages of pregnancy and those with very young foals are removed from the herd to be trailered between the islands. During the swim, some lactating mares become affected with hypocalcemia, which is treated by on-site veterinarians. Larger foals are auctioned the next day and the majority of the herd, including any young foals, are returned to Assateague on Friday.

500|$|January 1930 {{also saw}} {{the first issue of}} Astounding Stories of Super-Science, which would go on to become the most {{influential}} magazine in the field within a decade. [...] The publisher was William Clayton, a successful publisher of pulp titles. [...] In 1928 Harold Hersey, who by then was working for Clayton, had suggested a new science fiction magazine to add to the line-up; Clayton was unconvinced, but changed his mind the following year. [...] Astoundings editor, Harry Bates, was uninterested in the educational goals that motivated Gernsback. [...] Bates filled Astounding with adventure stories with minimal scientific content: the stories are generally considered to have been poor quality, and Ashley considers Bates to have been [...] "destroying the ideals of science fiction" [...] with formulaic plots. [...] Gernsback's magazines were infamous for low rates and very slow payment, and Astoundings high rates and quick payment attracted some well-known pulp writers such as Murray Leinster and Jack Williamson. [...] Astounding was also better value for money than its competitors, with both <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> and, along with Amazing, the most pages. [...] By mid-1930, Gernsback began to consolidate his magazines, merging Air Wonder with Science Wonder Stories. [...] The combined magazine was titled Wonder Stories, and Science Wonder Quarterly was similarly retitled Wonder Stories Quarterly. [...] At the same time Scientific Detective Monthly was retitled Amazing Detective Tales. [...] Dropping [...] "Science" [...] and [...] "Scientific" [...] from the titles may have been intended to avoid giving readers the impression that these were actually scientific periodicals. [...] Amazing Detective Tales, at least, was not helped by the title change, and after the October issue Gernsback sold the magazine to Wallace Bamber, who published five more issues the following year, though there was no longer any sf or fantasy content.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse auction {{is a type}} of {{auction in}} which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the best price among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> they are willing to receive. By revealing the competing bids in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.|$|E
