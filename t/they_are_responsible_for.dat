5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and {{for the development of}} venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|The AMS also {{manages the}} Student Constable {{peer to peer}} {{security}} service at the university. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> ensuring the safety of patrons and staff at sanctioned events and venues across the campus, enforcing governing regulations of the AMS and uphold regulations stipulated in the Liquor Licence Act of Ontario. Student Constables do not serve as the university's primary security service as they are legally not peace officers, nor are they registered as a private security service under the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. The university's administration operates its own security service which is registered in Ontario as a private security service. As of March 2012, the Student Constables are funded through a mandatory $10 fee levied on undergraduates annually by the AMS.|$|E

5|$|The {{headquarters}} of the GLA is City Hall, Southwark; the mayor is Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011. The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).|$|E
5|$|The seven member {{county council}} is the fiscal {{branch of the}} county {{government}} and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts and three are elected at-large. The council members serve four-year terms. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes {{in the form of}} an income tax, property tax, excise taxes, and service taxes. County income and property taxes are subject to state level approval. In 2013 the council members were Phil Smith, District 1 (R); Gary Davis, District 2 (R); Gordon Pendleton, District 3 (D); Ralph Sherman District 4 (R); Sherry Brown, At-Large (R); Richard Gerdon, At-Large (D); Jim Heitkemper, At-Large (R).|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{pollination}} {{of approximately}} {{one third of}} the United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E

5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{committees}} of the National Assembly. Committee membership {{is determined by}} the National Assembly. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the studying and examination of bills, legislative initiatives, drafts of ordinances and other drafts of legal documents and reports assigned by the National Assembly or the Standing Committee.

The National Assembly elects the Ethnic Council, which consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairmen and other members. The Ethnic Council studies and recommends actions to the National Assembly; the National Assembly has to consult with the Ethnic Council before issuing any decisions on ethnic policy.
