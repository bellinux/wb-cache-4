5|$|In 1978, a {{dissident}} movement {{of a different}} kind emerged when a group of unemployed miners led by Vladimir Klebanov attempted <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> labor union and demand collective bargaining. The main groups of Soviet dissidents, consisting mostly of intellectuals, remained aloof, and Klebanov was soon confined to a mental institution. Another attempt a month later <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> union of white collar professionals was also quickly broken up by authorities and its founder Vladimir Svirsky arrested.|$|E

5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are}} the only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> {{corridor}} through the crowd between {{the house where the}} magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> human barrier.|$|E

The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> government.

5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} is also {{a popular}} source of fluoride in organofluorine chemistry. For example, CsF reacts with hexafluoroacetone <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> caesium perfluoroalkoxide salt, which is stable up to 60°C, unlike the corresponding sodium or potassium salt. It will convert electron-deficient aryl chlorides to aryl fluorides (halex reaction).|$|E
5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice {{space of the}} Melvins. Cobain wanted <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond {{for a long period}} of time. In persuading Novoselic <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart. In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E
