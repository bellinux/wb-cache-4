50|$|There are two batter's boxes, one on {{each side}} of home plate. The batter's boxes are 4 feet wide (1.2 m) and 6 feet long (1.8 m). The batter's boxes are {{centered}} lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box 6 inches (15.24 cm) from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed batter would stand in the batter's box {{on the left side of}} home plate from the perspective of the catcher and umpire. A left-handed batter would stand in the batter's box to their right. A batter may only occupy one batter's box at a time and may not legally leave the batter's box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the batter wish to leave the batter's box once the pitcher has engaged the rubber, he must first ask the umpire for <b>time-out.</b> <b>Time</b> will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the batter's box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the Official Baseball Rules.|$|E
30|$|A Flow Label is set {{by means}} of a pseudo random generator, so chances that {{incoming}} traffic flows have the same Flow Label should be very small [25]. The assignment of a Flow Label to an n-tuple expires when termination messages (e.g., TCP FIN) are signaled within the traffic flow or when a timer expires after some idle time. This timer can e.g., be based on the typical maximum TCP <b>time-out</b> <b>time</b> (a number of minutes or hours).|$|E
50|$|In water polo, {{each team}} is {{entitled}} two sixty-second <b>time-outs</b> in regular <b>time,</b> and one extra <b>time-out</b> in extra <b>time.</b> The <b>time-out</b> {{can only be}} called if the team is in possession of the ball.|$|R
50|$|If {{there is}} still enough time left on the clock and the winning team {{attempts}} another quarterback kneel, the defensive team's strategy may repeat itself until it either runs out of <b>time-outs,</b> <b>time</b> runs out, or (most desirably) the team forces a punt or turnover, though in 2016, the Baltimore Ravens, leading {{in a game against}} the Cincinnati Bengals after three plays, ran off the remaining twelve seconds of clock off in a punt formation with Sam Koch purposefully holding the ball in the end zone while multiple holding calls were made against the Ravens offense. The play ended with Koch touching his toe to the back end zone line after time expired and taking an intentional safety (offensive fouls {{at the end of the}} game do not result in a replay of a down, unlike their defensive equivalents). The intentional holding aspect of the play is expected to be made illegal after the 2016 NFL season.|$|R
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found <b>time-out</b> and <b>times</b> {{to be by}} far the most {{prevalent}} terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of <b>time-out</b> or <b>time</b> as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|R
50|$|Officials {{also call}} for media <b>time-outs,</b> which allow <b>time</b> for {{television}} and radio advertising. They also stop the clock after a change of possession of the ball from one team to the other. Successful PATs (Point(s) After Touchdown), a field goal try, or a kickoff may also warrant stopping the clock. If an instant replay challenge is called during the game, the referees signal for a media time out. The referee signals these media time-outs by first using the time out signal, then extending both arms in a horizontal position.|$|R

5000|$|Powers officiated the triple-overtime Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, {{which was}} notable for {{controversial}} moments involving Powers. With the score tied at 95 with three seconds {{remaining in the}} fourth quarter, Boston stole a Suns inbound pass and the Celtics' Paul Silas attempted to call a time-out by giving the [...] "T" [...] sign to Powers. Boston had no timeouts remaining, which if recognized, {{would have resulted in}} a technical foul and a free throw awarded to Phoenix. However, Powers did not acknowledge Silas's request for the <b>time-out</b> as <b>time</b> expired. Mendy Rudolph and Rick Barry, color commentators for the CBS Sports telecast, were quick to note that Silas was signaling for a timeout, but Powers ignored the request. [...] Boston {{went on to win the}} game in the third overtime period. According to the Suns organization, Powers later told a Phoenix golf professional that he didn't want to see the championship decided on a technicality. Angered over the incident, Al Bianchi, then-assistant coach of the Suns, ordered a ring in which the words [...] "Fuck You, Richie Powers" [...] were inscribed.|$|R
5000|$|Play calling {{during the}} two-minute drill {{emphasizes}} high probabilities of significant yardage gains or clock stoppages. To help control the clock, teams tend to pass rather than run and to pass near the sidelines {{rather than the}} middle of the field. [...] The former provides for incomplete passes while the latter allows the receiver to run out of bounds, both stopping the clock. When plays that do not stop the clock occur, the offense relies on a combination of hurry-up plays and spiking the football [...] - [...] a play where the quarterback stops the clock by immediately throwing the ball into the ground (sacrificing a down by doing so) [...] - [...] and <b>time-outs</b> to minimize <b>time</b> lost. Additionally, in college football, the offense can temporarily stop the clock by gaining a first down.|$|R
25|$|Pulver battled back in {{the third}} round, {{successfully}} defending Penn's attempts {{to take him to}} the ground, and even scoring defensive takedowns on Penn. Pulver frustrated Penn with nothing more than sheer will power, not only winning the later rounds, but out-grappling the world-renowned Penn. In the fifth round, Penn, frustrated and down on points, chose to stand and trade with Pulver. For the entire five minutes of the fifth round the two stood toe to toe exchanging strikes. With 45 seconds left in the round, a left hand from Pulver staggered Penn, who looked in trouble. However, Penn countered with a right kick straight to the groin, resulting in a 50-second time-out. Although the <b>time-out</b> gave Penn <b>time</b> to recover, when the bout was restarted, Pulver staggered him a second time with 20 seconds remaining. However, the round drew to a conclusion and the fight went into the judges' hands.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In several fields, Satisfiability being one, {{there are}} regular {{competitions}} to compare multiple solvers {{in a common}} setting. Due to the fact some benchmarks of interest are too difficult for all solvers to complete within available <b>time,</b> <b>time-outs</b> occur and must be considered. Through some strange evolution, time-outs became the only factor that was considered in evaluation. Previous work in SAT 2010 observed that this evaluation method is unreliable and lacks a way to attach statistical significance to its conclusions. However, the proposed alternative was quite complicated and is unlikely to see general use. This paper describes a simpler system, called careful ranking, that permits a measure of statistical significance, and still meets many of the practical requirements of an evaluation system. It incorporates {{one of the main}} ideas of the previous work: that outcomes had to be freed of assumptions about timing distributions, so that non-parametric methods were necessary. Unlike the previous work, it incorporates ties...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{complex systems}} are being {{designed}} that consist of concurrently operating and communicating processes, often combining both hardware and software. A methodology for high level specification {{and design of}} software/ hardware systems (SHE [1]) {{has been designed to}} cope with this increasing complexity. SHE incorporates a formal specification language named POOSL. Many systems today can be characterised as real-time. The timing properties of such a realtime system determine the correctness of an implementation. This paper describes the extension of the language POOSL with a notion of time and with real-time primitives, which enable it to specify and model timing properties. Concepts and aspects related to timing and concurrency are discussed and options for introducing time and adding temporal meaning to existing elements of the language are investigated. The language POOSL and its formal semantics have been extended with a notion of time and a new primitive has been added. It is shown that this extension enables the expression of typical forms of temporal behaviour such as execution <b>time,</b> <b>time-out</b> behaviour, etcetera. POOSL can thus be used as a formal basis for specifying and designing real-time systems within the SHE methodology.
