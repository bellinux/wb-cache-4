5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol, a low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked {{cashmere}} sweater and tailored skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing <b>the</b> <b>headaches.</b> While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E

40|$|When {{a family}} {{approaches}} a childhood headache center, {{it means that}} their child’s headache has reached important levels that disturb the family’s regular life. In most cases, the family wants <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> to cease as soon as possible. <b>The</b> <b>headache</b> center inverts this message: <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> exists and is real {{but it is a}} symptom or sign, representing a real pathology. A careful study is therefore necessary, evaluating the char-acteristics of <b>the</b> child’s <b>headache</b> and his/her interactions with the family group. These psychological interaction possi-bilities between <b>the</b> young <b>headache</b> sufferer and their sur-rounding environment have led researchers to try and identi-fy a personality type of <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> sufferer, which has been assessed more as features or psychiatric comorbidities. This issue is so important that, for example, at <b>the</b> last International <b>Headache</b> Society (IHS) conference in September 2003, five works that explored this issue were presented [1 – 5]...|$|R

40|$|Headache is a {{ubiquitous}} complaint, {{yet it is}} {{one that}} often elicits anxiety in both patients and physicians. When a patient presents with <b>headache,</b> <b>the</b> clinician must answer the following questions: (1) Is <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> "worrisome" (secondary to underlying disease) ? (2) If <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> is benign, what type is it?

25|$|Preventive {{medications}} {{are generally}} recommended {{when people have}} more than four attacks of migraine per month, headaches last longer than 12 hours or <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> are very disabling.

25|$|If {{her sons}} were sources of great concern, Vicky's daughters didn't usually cause problems. The only {{exception}} was Charlotte, {{the eldest of}} the princesses. A girl with slow growth and a difficult education, she was regularly prone to fits of rage during her childhood. Growing up, her health became delicate and, {{in addition to her}} capricious personality, she also revealed an irritable character. Today, several historians (like John C. G. Röhl, Martin Warren and David Hunt) defend the thesis that Charlotte suffered from porphyria, as did her maternal ancestor King George III. This could explain the gastrointestinal problems, migraines and nervous crises that tormented the princess. The same historians believe that <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> and skin rashes that Victoria treated with doses of morphine were also a consequence of porphyria, albeit in a weaker form than that suffered by Charlotte.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1937, Gershwin {{began to}} {{complain}} of blinding headaches and a recurring {{impression that he}} smelled burning rubber. On February 11, 1937, he performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra {{under the direction of}} French maestro Pierre Monteux. Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance. He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in Beverly Hills. Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table. She suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg's empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller. <b>The</b> <b>headaches</b> and olfactory hallucinations continued.|$|E

25|$|Many {{physicians}} also recommend {{changes in}} diet to treat chronic headaches. Many chronic headache sufferers {{fail to recognize}} foods or beverages as headache factors, because the consumption may not consistently cause headaches or <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> may be delayed. Many of the chemicals in certain foods can cause chronic headaches, including caffeine, monosodium glutamate (MSG), nitrites, nitrates, tyramine, and alcohols. Some of the foods and beverages that chronic headache sufferers are advised to avoid include caffeinated beverages, chocolate, processed meats, cheese and fermented dairy products, fresh yeast-risen baked goods, nuts, and alcohol as well as certain fruits and vegetables. Additionally, people may have differing dietary triggers on an individualized basis, because not all foods affect people the same way. Different medical professionals suggest different ways of testing or changing diets. Some may suggest eliminating {{a few of the}} potentially headache-causing foods at a time {{for a short period of}} time, while others suggest removing all the threatening foods from a person's diet and slowly adding a couple back at a time. Yet, others may not suggest diet modification at all. The treatment of chronic headaches through changes in diet is based on personal opinion, and, therefore, controversial.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{headaches}} {{are classified}} {{based on their}} cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> associated with homeostasis disorders {{in the category of}} secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.|$|E

While living at the Kirchherrs' house his condition got worse, and after collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to hospital by Kirchherr (who rode with him in the ambulance), but he died before the ambulance reached the hospital.

[...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and <b>the</b> <b>headaches,</b> had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out.
