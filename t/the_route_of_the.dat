5|$|State Route 201 {{is one of}} the {{original}} highways through the Salt Lake Valley. Signs along the route claim the path of the highway to be the historical route of the California Trail, Pony Express and Lincoln Highway. While signed as <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California Trail, modern 2100 South is a less common branch called Hastings Cutoff that became infamous because of the Donner Party. The Lincoln Highway, generally derived from <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pony Express across Utah, was routed on 2100 South. However, no modern highway exactly follows <b>the</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pony Express west of Salt Lake City. SR-201 is one of a few auto-tour routes that approximates the Pony Express trail, which actually ran south of the road.|$|E
