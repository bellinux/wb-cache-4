5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is received.

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around the pulsar. The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the pulsar, but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival <b>times</b> <b>are</b> consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness.

The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival <b>times</b> <b>are</b> recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Gestation lasts {{eight to}} nine months, {{following}} which a single calf or twins (even triplets at <b>times)</b> <b>are</b> born. In a 2004 {{study in the}} Sariska reserve, twins accounted for as high as 80 {{percent of the total}} calf population. Births peak from June to October in the Bharatpur National Park, and from April to August in southern Texas. Calves are precocial; they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth, and forage by the fourth week. Pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves are kept in hiding for the first few weeks of their lives. This period of concealment can last as long as a month in Texas. Calves, mainly males, bicker playfully by neck-fighting. Young males would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups. The lifespan of the nilgai is typically ten years in Texas.|$|E
