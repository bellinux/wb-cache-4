5|$|Each {{in their}} own way is making the same point, that Bewick's work is more than mere illustration. Its liveliness and truth to {{experience}} appeals to the imagination of <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> calls forth an individual response that goes beyond the text.|$|E

5|$|Martin's inspirations {{included}} the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon. A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal {{of women and}} religion, {{as well as its}} realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>and</b> the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.|$|E

5000|$|The {{nature of}} writing and reading on the go, creates a unique experience, {{allowing}} <b>the</b> writer <b>and</b> <b>reader</b> to approach literature in a different way, opening interactivity between <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> writer as the story develops in [...] "real time".|$|R
5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, {{a tendency to be}} pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E
5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>and</b> for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written {{after the death of his}} young daughter.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E

25|$|Thackeray {{saw himself}} as writing in the {{realistic}} tradition, and distinguished his work from the exaggerations and sentimentality of Dickens. Some later commentators have accepted this self-evaluation and seen him as a realist, but others note his inclination to use eighteenth-century narrative techniques, such as digressions and direct addresses to <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>and</b> argue that through them he frequently disrupts the illusion of reality. The school of Henry James, {{with its emphasis on}} maintaining that illusion, marked a break with Thackeray's techniques.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} {{has been an important}} influence on the short story in Ireland. Recently Jack Hart declared in the preface to his collection From Under Gogol's Nose (2004) that the parameters of the short story had been set too narrowly. He advocates a broader range of possibilities, from stories that are almost essays to those that are almost poems. He argues that the short story should be seen as closer by nature to the poem, requiring a similar engagement from <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> communicating in a similar way through a fundamentally oral/aural process.|$|E
25|$|The Bridge of Asses (Pons Asinorum) {{states that}} in {{isosceles}} triangles the angles {{at the base}} equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. Its name {{may be attributed to}} its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.|$|E

25|$|However, read {{range is}} both a {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, there was a growing {{tendency}} to make explicit distinction between the condemned and the reader. The condemned was increasingly relegated to his social sphere; he was not seen as a sinner, someone to whom the audience could relate to, but as someone who came from an intellectually and morally inferior class. By the 1760s it was common for the Ordinary to put emphasis on grammatical and orthographic errors of the condemned and to apologise for having as subjects such mean individuals. The Ordinary frequently made claims that the condemned were creatures deserving of pity, suggesting that common criminals lacked the moral and intellectual faculties of the readers and so emphasising the distance between <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> the condemned.|$|E
25|$|Reviews can {{be given}} by both {{anonymous}} and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly. This system is intended for a type of bond between <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> the writer, as well as helping the author improve his or her writing skills through constructive criticism, enabling {{him or her to}} produce a better work next time. Occasionally, unmoderated review systems are abused to send flames, spam, or trolling messages. As a result, the author of the story can either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on his/her preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.|$|E
30|$|In a single-reader scenario, the {{operations}} on the UHF domain and UWB domain can be illustrated as follows. In the UHF domain, a passive tag collects {{power from the}} RF signal transmitted by <b>the</b> RFID <b>reader</b> <b>and</b> sends data back by modulating the backscattered UHF signal. In the UWB domain, the already energized tag transmits back information by modulating the backscattered UWB pulses. The UHF and UWB links can operate simultaneously both on <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> <b>and</b> tag’s side. Here, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> uses UHF for identification, while the UWB technology is adopted for tag population estimation.|$|R
