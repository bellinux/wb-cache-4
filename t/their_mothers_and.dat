5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they {{do not seem to}} have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther from <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, the {{organizing}} committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked—an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young. Each baboon has a social ranking somewhere in the group, {{depending}} on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having nearly the same rank as <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives form their own subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely friendly to each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within the troop. Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} little {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> the frequency of such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species {{do not appear to}} compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|E

25|$|Albert Einstein's {{second wife}} was Elsa Einstein, whose mother Fanny Koch was {{the sister of}} Albert's mother, and whose father, Rudolf Einstein, {{was the son of}} Raphael Einstein, a brother of Albert's {{paternal}} grandfather.

25|$|The crowds on {{this tour}} were {{much younger than}} {{previous}} audiences had been, with many preadolescent children in Kiss make-up with <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> fathers (who were sometimes wearing the make-up themselves) in tow at most concerts.

Mithridates VI showed clemency towards <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> brother, by imprisoning them both. Laodice VI died in prison of natural causes, however Mithridates Chrestus could have died in prison from natural causes or was tried for treason and was executed on his orders.

25|$|Another {{discovery}} was that resident killer whales {{have one of}} the most stable social structures of any animal species. Pods of killer whales had previously been assumed to consist of a few adult males and a harem of potential female mates. Bigg's team slowly realized that killer whale pods are matrilineal: killer whales travel not with their mates, but with <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> maternal relatives. The basis of resident killer whale groupings is the rule that each animal travels primarily with its mother throughout their lives.|$|E
25|$|In {{this way}} the {{institution}} of slavery in Maryland was made self-perpetuating, as the slaves lived well enough to reproduce. The numbers of slaves in Maryland increased by continued imports up until 1808, and also by natural increase. By making slave status dependent on the mother, according {{to the principle of}} partus sequitur ventrem, Maryland, like Virginia, abandoned the common-law approach of England, in which the social status of children depended on their father. In the colonies, children would take the status of <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> thus be born into slavery if their mothers were enslaved, regardless if their fathers were white, English and Christian, as many were.|$|E
25|$|The {{making of}} {{traditional}} huipils {{is an important}} cultural and economic activity for the Amuzgos, especially in Xochistlahuaca where most people still wear traditional clothing. Girls begin learning the craft when they are young, learning techniques and designs from <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> grandmothers. The weaving is {{an important source of}} income as agriculture is not enough to meet most families’ needs. While they work on other items such as tablecloths and other items of clothing, the most popular and most valued remains the huipil. Amuzgo women have achieved a certain level of fame, with weavers such as Florentina López de Jesús winning recognition at the 2001 UNESCO handcraft competition for Latin America and Caribbean.|$|E

25|$|Polygyny once {{practiced by}} leaders has nearly disappeared, {{possibly}} {{from the pressure}} missionaries put on them. Most marriages are now consecrated by a Catholic priest. Divorce is not uncommon and is initiated by either spouse. A village leader may get involved and try to convince a couple to stay together. The nuclear family along with a grandparent is the common arrangement in a household. Often {{a man who is}} leader will surround his large house with smaller homes for his sons' and daughters' families. As an essential part of their way of life, young children act as a companion to adults. They stay with <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> help with house and garden work.|$|E
25|$|Children {{are passed}} {{substantial}} body burdens by <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> breastfeeding increases the child's body burden. Dioxin exposure can also occur from contact with Pentachlorophenol (Penta) treated lumber as Pentachlorophenol often contains dioxins as a contaminant. Children's daily intakes during breast feeding are often many times above the intakes of adults based on body weight. This {{is why the}} WHO consultation group assessed the tolerable intake so as to prevent a woman from accumulating harmful body burdens before her first pregnancy. Breast fed children usually still have higher dioxin body burdens than non breast fed children. The WHO still recommends breast feeding for its other benefits. In many countries dioxins in breast milk have decreased by even 90% during the two last decades.|$|E
25|$|Stake {{and ward}} Young Women {{organizations}} are supervised by the Young Women General Presidency. From 1994 to 2013, an annual General Young Women Meeting {{was held in}} March, where typically the Young Women general presidency {{and a member of}} the church's First Presidency would speak to the young women, <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> the adult Young Women leaders. The meeting was broadcast via satellite to LDS Church meetinghouses throughout the world. The proceedings of the meeting were published in the May issues of the Liahona and Ensign magazines. Video and audio of the proceedings are archived and available for downloading on the church's website. In 2014, the meeting was replaced by a semiannual general women's meeting for those eight years of age and older.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that, in hindsight, the {{campaign}} for the universal promotion of breastfeeding prior to the acknowledgement of HIV contraction via mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) fails to consider affected mothers in developing countries who have limited or no access to procedures that would minify the chance of spreading the virus to their young ones. Initiatives for a decreased percentage of infants contracting HIV include administering Antiretroviral therapy (ART) to <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> providing milk formula in hand with proper water sterilization techniques to prevent disease from contamination. The majority of opposition comes from local and global policy makers who argue about the non-feasibility of these projects. However others {{argue that there is}} limited say of the women directly affected, resulting in further segregation of women in developing nations from preventive aid and health care systems.|$|E
25|$|Teinolophos, from Australia, is the {{earliest}} known monotreme. A 2007 study (published 2008) suggests {{that it was not}} a basal (primitive, ancestral) monotreme but a full-fledged platypus, and therefore that the platypus and echidna lineages diverged considerably earlier. A more recent study (2009), however, has suggested that, while Teinolophos was a type of platypus, it was also a basal monotreme and predated the radiation of modern monotremes. The semi-aquatic lifestyle of platypuses prevented them from being outcompeted by the marsupials that migrated to Australia millions of years ago, since joeys need to remain attached to <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> would drown if their mothers ventured into water (though there are exceptions like the water opossum and the lutrine opossum; however, they both live in South America and thus don't come into contact with monotremes). Genetic evidence has determined that echidnas diverged from the platypus lineage as recently as 19-48M, when they made their transition from semi-aquatic to terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on {{the site where the}} Murrah Building once stood. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|E
