Mobile organic Rankine cycle systems target {{the recovery of}} waste heat in internal combustion engines, with the exhaust system identified as a prime source. This article presents a design methodology and working fluid selection for radial <b>turbo</b> <b>expanders</b> in a heavy-duty off-road diesel engine application. Siloxanes and Toluene are explored as the candidate working fluids, with the latter identified as the preferred option, before describing three radial turbine designs in detail. A small 15. 5 kW turbine design leads to impractical blade geometry, but a medium 34. 1 kW turbine, designed for minimum power, is predicted to achieve an isentropic efficiency of 51. 5 % at a rotational speed of 91. 7 kmin- 1. A similar 45. 6 kW turbine designed for maximum efficiency yields 56. 1 % at 71. 5 kmin- 1.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the energy in the fuel burned by the combustion engines used in modern vehicles is lost {{in the form of}} waste heat and does not contribute to the propulsion of the vehicle. Three different technologies have been proposed for recovering some of this lost heat and thereby increasing the overall efficiency of combustion engines: the turbocompound, thermoelectric converters, and heat engines based on the Rankine cycle. This thesis is about systems based on the Rankine cycle and the challenges associated with their incorporation into vehicles that are not encountered in more conventional applications. One such challenge relates to the selection of a suitable working fluid. To address this issue, a range of candidate fluids were evaluated, including organic fluids, ammonia, and water. In simulations, the best results were achieved using water-alcohol mixtures. Mixtures with a water content of 80 % by mass were found to be particularly useful since they are non-flammable and do not suffer from the freezing problems encountered when using pure water. Pure organic fluids were found to present numerous problems, including their low thermal stability, safety issues and in case of most organic refrigerants the potential to increase global warming. Another key challenge in the development of Rankine cycle systems for vehicles relates to the design of suitable expansion devices. Two expander types are considered suitable for vehicular systems: <b>turbo</b> <b>expanders</b> and displacement expanders. In order to establish a method for determining which type will offer the greatest efficiency in any given case, an analysis based on dimensionless numbers was performed. Displacement expanders were found to have favorable performance characteristics in situations involving high expansion pressure ratios and low flow rates; such conditions tend to increase the thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. On the other hand, <b>turbo</b> <b>expanders</b> can be made more compact than displacement expanders and may therefore be more suitable in cases where space is at a premium. Moreover, by using a pure organic working fluid instead of the suggested water-alcohol mixture and decreasing the expansion pressure ratio, the cycle parameters can be adjusted to permit the efficient operation of <b>turbo</b> <b>expanders.</b> Based on the above analyses of the system’s components, a model heat recovery system was created using the GT-Suite 1 -D flow simulation program. This model can be used in conjunction with a previously established model of a heavy-duty diesel engine created using the same software, which was in this work converted to mean-value model in order to permit faster computation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2014 Thesis () [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Gazların daha az enerji sarfiyatı ile daha ekonomik bir şekilde taşınabilmeleri için özgül hacimlerinin küçültülmeleri gerekir. Gazların özgül hacimlerinin küçültülmesi ise basınçlandırılarak ya da sıvılaştırılarak yapılabilir. Günümüzde doğal gazın taşınabilmesi için kullanılan iki ana metod vardır. Bunlar sıvılaştırılmış doğal gaz (LNG) ve yüksek basınç altında boru hattı ile taşıma metodlarıdır. Sıvılaştırılmış doğal gaz metodu boru hattının olmadığı yerlerde ve deniz aşırı taşımalarda kullanılır. Boru hatları ile taşıma metodu ise genellikle karasal alanda yapılmasına rağmen, zaman zaman denizaltından da yapılmaktadır. Uzun mesafe taşıma metodu her ne olursa olsun tüketiciye temin edilecek doğal gaz, düşük basınçlı şehir içi doğal gaz dağıtım hatlarıyla yapılır. Ülkemizde üretilen ve ithal edilen doğal gaz, BOTAŞ iletim şebekesi vasıtasıyla 50 – 75 bar basınç altında şehir giriş istasyonları olarak tanımladığımız RMS-A tipi istasyonlarda 18 – 25 bar basınca düşürülerek şehir doğal gaz dağıtım şebekesine ulaştırılır. Bu istasyonlarda yaklaşık 50 bar basınç düşürme işlemi, kullanılabilir enerjiyi üretmeden gerçekleşir. Bu problem termodinamik açıdan incelendiğinde, klasik basınç düşürme işlemleri yerine genleşme türbini (turbo-expander) kullanarak elektrik üretiminin yapılmasını, hatta küçük ölçekli sıvılaştırılmış doğal gaz (LNG) ünitesinin çalıştırılmasını mümkün kılabilir. Genleşme türbini vasıtasıyla elektrik üretimi, enerji kaynaklarının kısıtlılığı ve çevresel değerler dikkate alındığında hızla önem kazanmaktadır. Bu yolla yapılacak sistemin kapasitesi, giriş basıncı, giriş sıcaklığı, debi ve çıkış basıncına bağlı olarak birkaç yüz kW’dan birkaç MW’a kadar değişebilir. Bu konuda Amerika, İngiltere, İtalya, Çekoslovakya ve Rusya gibi ülkelerde çeşitli çalışmalar ve araştırma amaçlı uygulamalar yapılmıştır. San Diego (California), Memphis (Tennessee) ve Hamilton (New Jersey) ilk uygulamalar arasındadır, (Bloach ve Soares, 2001). Bu teknolojinin, Türkiye’deki iletim ve dağıtım sisteminin ve ekonomik koşullarının dikkate alınarak kullanılması durumunda potansiyel elektrik üretimi ve bir kazanç elde edilebileceği analizi bu çalışmanın temelini oluşturmaktadır. Specific {{volume of}} gas {{has to be}} {{decreased}} in order to transmit it with more economical way as well as diminishing energy consumption. Specific volume of gas can be reduced with liquefaction or compression. Currently, {{there are two different}} methods to transmit natural gas. These methods are liquefied natural gas (LNG) and transmission through pipeline under high pressure. Liquefied natural gas method is used in locations {{in which there is no}} available pipeline or overseas transportations. Transmission with pipelines is mostly constructed at terrestrial zones, although submarine pipeline implementations are rarely needed. No matter what the long distance transmission method is, natural gas for the end user must be distributed through low pressure inner-city pipelines. The natural gas produced domestically or being imported by licensed governmental/private companies is transmitted to local gas distribution network by reducing the high pressures from 50 - 75 bar to moderate pressures 18 - 25 bar at city gate stations, so called RMS-A. This approximately 50 bar pressure reduction process is carried out via regulator at the RMS-A type stations without recovering useful energy. If the problem is analyzed with respect to thermodynamic principles, the power generation by operating a <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> or a small scale LNG unit is possible to reduce line pressure without using or along with conventional regulators. It should not be forgotten that the <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> system is installed parallel to regulator system and will operate between the predetermined design flow rates. Power generation through an expansion turbine comes into prominence quickly when considering limited energy sources and environmental concerns. The capacity of this kind of power generation system may vary from a few hundred kW to several MW depending on the system design parameters such as inlet and outlet pressures, inlet and outlet temperatures, mass flow rate, and system efficiency, thermodynamic properties of natural gas, etc. Some applications on power generation issue including research oriented works have been carried out in the USA, England, Italy, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Iran, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Early applications of <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> systems are performed in San Diego (California), Memphis (Tennessee), Hamilton (New Jersey), (Bloach and Soares, 2001). Nowadays, widespread application of turbo expanders is very common all around the World, (Bloach ve Soares, 2001). The main objective of this study is to determine and demonstrate the potential profitability of power generation from turbo expanders if this technology is used in RMS-A stations in Turkey. Annual data representing year 2013 from Çorlu, Kayseri and Yalova RMS-A stations have been used for designing power generation system to achieve the goal in each aforementioned city-gate stations. The tabulated raw data was processed using Excel spreadsheet program to determine maximum and minimum volumetric flow rates in hourly basis. Then, the data in hourly basis was converted into monthly and annually bases. Afterwards, design flow rate of <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> that could be operated at various volumetric flow rates was initially determined using the annual consumption rate. The variable operation rate of turbine is selected to be in the range of 50 % higher and 40 % lower than the design flow rate as informed by a manufacturer. Applying this preselected variable flow rates of <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> to raw data, net operating period of turbine in terms of hours per year were determined for the each examined RMS-A stations. The main components of the <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> system are turbine, gear box and generator, and boiler and heat exchanger. The other assumed constant parameters used in the design process are as follow; pressure at turbine outlet is 19 bar, temperature at turbine outlet is 5 oC (by using minimum dew point of 0 oC based on the technical specification by BOTAŞ), temperature at turbine inlet before preheating is 20 oC, natural gas composition is 100 % methane, combined efficiency of boiler and heat exchanger is 0. 80, combined efficiency of gear box and generator is 0. 85. In addition, the process in the turbine is assumed to be adiabatic, reversible, and isentropic. The average inlet pressure at the turbine in each city-gate stations was calculated using the approach of weighted mean flow rate. Design of <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> system relies on conservation of mass and energy principles on a control volume. Applying the second law of thermodynamics, the minimum required natural gas temperature at the inlet of turbine can be calculated by considering the outlet temperature and pressure constraints. Heat energy necessary for increasing the temperature of natural gas before entering the turbine, so called preheating requirement, is determined from the temperature difference between the calculated gas temperature at the inlet of turbine and the average gas inlet temperature at RMS-A station. The required heat energy is provided by burning some of the natural gas from the system. Power generation from a <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> strongly depends on the isentropic efficiency of a turbine and the mass flow rate of natural gas. In this study, the power generation from the turbine and the required preheating energy were calculated with different isentropic efficiencies ranging from 0. 70 to 0. 85 and different design flow rates of natural gas for Çorlu, Kayseri, and Yalova RMS-A stations. Results reveal that unless provided from external sources, the preheating energy cost for increasing the natural gas temperature is approximately 50 % of the total income obtained from the generated electricity sales. In the analyses, it is assumed that natural gas cost is 0. 06746081 TL/kWh, and selling price of electricity is 0. 105 US$/kWh, and exchange rate of US $ to TL is 2. 1019. Net power generation from a <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> has a strong relationship with the pressure ratio at inlet and outlet, the design flow rate, and the isentropic efficiency. However, the pressure ratio is not a controllable parameter. The required preheating energy similar to total income from the <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> increases with increasing isentropic efficiency of turbine. Results also indicate that considering the consumption rate in year 2013, 1. 26 MW of installed capacity is sufficient for Çorlu RMS-A station with the design flow rate of 30, 000 Nm 3 /hr. Similarly, 3. 57 MW of installed capacity is sufficient for Kayseri RMS-A station with the design flow rate of 85, 000 Nm 3 /hr, and 1. 412 MW of installed capacity is sufficient for Yalova RMS-A station with the design flow rate of 35, 000 Nm 3 /hr. The design flow rates using 2013 data are adequate to operate the turbo expanders 6069 hours in Çorlu, 5009 hours in Kayseri, and 8370 hours in Yalova. Net annual revenues from the stations yield that $ 225, 071 from Çorlu RMS-A, $ 500, 898 from Kayseri RMS-A, and $ 347, 069 from Yalova RMS-A. The revenues do not consider operating costs.

40|$|Rotating shafts are {{employed}} in industrial machines such as steam and gas turbines, cryogenic <b>turbo</b> <b>expanders,</b> <b>turbo</b> generators, internal combustion engines, centrifugal compressors for power transmission. On account of the ever increasing demand for power and high speed transportation, the rotors of these machines are made extremely flexible to allow bending. The shafts of these machines are subjected to torsional and bending vibration {{and in some cases}} unstable condition of operation. These machines can develop excessive stress in torsion because of low torsional natural frequencies of the system involving flexible couplings. Determination of natural frequencies and mode shapes is thus important from design point of view. Lateral bending and subsequently whirling of a rotor may arise due to residual unbalance (present due to corrosion, material inhomogeneity etc.) which would cause the simple circular shaft on rigid supports carrying concentrated masses experience synchronous whirl and when the shaft runs at a speed equal to its natural frequency in lateral bending, the whirling becomes predominant. This phenomenon is different from conventional resonance since large amplitude vibration cannot be controlled by additional damping. As the resonance occurs the shaft develops stresses violently, causing the shaft to fail suddenly or decreasing its life. Considering the importance of critical shape and unbalance responses, an effort is made to develop interactive and user-friendly software capable of evaluating the much needed data like critical speed, the associated mode shapes and unbalance-response of a given rotor...|$|R

National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, has taken up a project for development of cryosorption based helium purifier funded by the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, Mumbai, which primarily aims at developing helium purifier and studying its performance. This dissertation details the design, fabrication and performance analysis of a prototype helium purifier. The purifier is based on the principle of cryocondensation of moisture and air impurities on heat exchangers at appropriate temperatures and cryosorption on activated charcoal to yield Grade 4. 5 helium from 60 % pure helium at LN 2 temperature. The purifier has been designed for 6 hours nonstop operation with throughput of 20 nm 3 /hr and delivery of pure helium at a pressure of 150 bar(a), which is ensured by a reciprocating compressor. The vital component, adsorber columns, was packed with Indian manufactured granular coconut shell activated charcoal in 50 NB Sch 80 SS 316 L pipe. Other major components include moisture collector vessel, liquid air separator vessel, three heat exchangers, snow filter, gas bag, cylinder manifold and superinsulated LN 2 vessel housing all cryogenic components of purifier.

To achieve such high effectiveness, it is necessary to use plate fin heat exchangers, which provides very high heat transfer surface area for heat exchange per unit volume (ratio greater than 700 m 2 /m 3) of heat exchanger.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the European Combined Efficient Large Scale Integrated Urban Systems (CELSIUS) project, the Genoa demonstrator involves the insertion of a <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> (TE) to substitute the standard throttling process in a natural gas expansion station. In this way, the currently wasted mechanical energy will be recovered, while an internal combustion combined heat and power (CHP) unit will be used to meet the heating requirements of the gas before the expansion and to serve a small district heating network (DHN). Both TE and CHP are capable of delivering electric power (EP) up to 1 MW. In order to match the EP production vs demand is highly desirable to use the EP extra capacity for local EP final users, such as a nearby public school and a gas refueling station (RS). For limiting the school’s consumption of fossil fuel, it is possible to use the EP surplus generated by the demonstrator to feed a heat pump in parallel to the heating conventional system. With regard to the RS, the compressors are currently driven by electric motors, with a high-energy consumption. The integrated system gives the possibility of exploiting the surplus of electricity production and of recovering heat, which would be otherwise wasted, from the intercooling of compressed gas, thus powering the DHN through a preheating system.

Given the different waste-heat rates of these two engines, the relationships between Rankine cycle performance and design aspects such as the expansion ratio and the locations of pinch points in the heat exchanger were evaluated. The calculated values of these parameters were used as inputs in a dimensionless analysis to identify an optimal expansion machine for each case. The impact of varying the working fluid used was investigated, since it had a large impact on the results obtained and provided insights into design dependencies in these systems...|$|R
40|$|Use of <b>Turbo</b> Compressor/ <b>Expanders</b> (TCEs) as {{industrial}} reversed Brayton Cycle Heat Pumps {{offers many}} technical and energy saving advantages. Until recently, such devices {{have been far}} too expensive in both capital cost and inefficiency mainly because the compressor and expander stages were built for forward Brayton Cycle operation in unmatched compressor/expander efficiencies. A few years ago, NUCON initiated a program to locate sources of TCEs and to engineer cost effective modifications to these standard TCEs for use in reverse Brayton Cycle condensation based pollution control and solvent recovery, material recycle applications. The NUCON program is continuing to further improve the matched compressor/expander efficiency, the availability and cost effectiveness of these uses. This program has resulted in major advances in availability and significant improvements in efficiency...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 90 The {{prevailing}} use {{of expansion}} gases in distribution stations can be economically {{replaced by the}} application of <b>turbo</b> <b>expanders.</b> The advantage of turbine impulse wheels {{is that they have}} high efficiencies, even at very low partial load. With a single valve control easily programmable, seven valve points can be achieved with three control valves. Thereby, throttle losses can be minimized. The design of the valves and their drives can be adapted to the operation requirements. Bearings and couplings are deleted by a combination of expander and gear in one unit, resulting in less power loss, lower investments, and higher availability. The advantages of planetary gears compared to helicals are higher efficiency, smoother running, lower tooth loads, lower noise, and smaller plot plan. This results in secondary advantages such as smaller oil systems, baseplates, and foundations. The disadvantages are higher quality requirements regarding production and more components which, however, are smaller. When an automatic clutch is used, the LP section is shut down as soon as the gas mass flow is zero. The LP section is back into operation within a few seconds after having gas flow. The plant operates fully automatically without operators and maintenance personnel being present at the location. The economic application of expansion turbines used for energy recovery depends not only on a turbine, but on all plant components. The gain of the useful energy is higher than the expenditure of investments, operating costs and maintenance costs. The possibilities of energy recuperation from the natural gas pressure in distributing mains shall be demonstrated by means of an example. The natural gas distribution station of a large German town is supplied from a 41 bar distribution main and transmits the natural gas in two networks of 13 bar or 5 bar. Previously, the natural gas was depressured through throttle valves, and the energy contained in the natural gas was destroyed. Now the gas expansion will be used for the generation of electric energy by the use of expansion turbines...|$|R

In the present paper, commercial gas turbines, just modified for storage purposes, are considered. The possibility to improve their profitability in an utility perspective is investigated. The adopted strategy {{is based on a}} fair mix of different working states (charging, discharging, stand by or mere Brayton cycle operation), according to the instant energy market price, the previous history (storage level) and the plant features (reservoir and GT size). A simple mathematical model of the plant was conceived and a dynamic self-adjusting abacus was developed in order to select a suitable sequence of working ways. The expected results consist in the improvement of the daily cash flow and in the peak power augmentation. Both of them are due to the chance of exploiting a <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> not loaded with the compressor driving during the hours when energy price is the highest...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Stress {{corrosion}} cracking of 7050 aluminum alloys and ASTM A 470 steel in the <b>turbo</b> <b>expander</b> and steam/gas turbine industry can cause expensive catastrophic failures, especially for turbo machinery systems performing in hostile, corrosive environments. Commercially available inhibitors were investigated for their effectiveness in reducing and controlling the corrosion susceptibility. Inhibitor effectiveness was confirmed with electrochemical corrosion techniques in different solutions. Polarization resistance increased with concentration of corrosion inhibitor due to film formation and displacement of water molecules. Cyclic polarization behavior for samples in the 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % inhibitors showed {{a shift in}} the passive film breakdown potential. The substantial increase in the passive range has positive consequences for neutralizing pitting and crevice corrosion cell chemistry. The strain to failure and tensile strength obtained from the slow strain rate studies for both alloys showed pronounced improvement due to corrosion inhibitor ability to mitigate SCC; the fractographic analysis showed a changed morphology with ductile overload as the primary failure mode instead of transgranular or intergranular cracking...|$|E

The three areas are: Design and application concerns; Operating experience ? Troubleshooting: Design and Applications Concerns Starting with an overview of the different types of applications, some of the unique issues encountered are elaborated on. A few case studies are presented on design and application issues in order for others to learn from these experiences and avoid duplications of potential problems. Operating Experience Reliability and availability data from many of these applications is presented in detail. The experience gained in technology implementation is discussed, along with some points to ensure field acceptance. Understanding and feeling comfortable with any new technology by all parties involved is key to its acceptance. Recommendations on how this can be achieved are presented. Troubleshooting: The different problems encountered in operation, and their resolutions, are reviewed. Many of these problems have been taken into account and eliminated in newer product designs, but as more manufacturers get into the business, these same problems should be understood so they may be avoided.

This project work involves analysis and optimization of the process parameters (helium flow rate, pressure and temperature) for main components (8 different heat exchangers and 3 different turbo-expanders) of helium plant of refrigeration capacity 1 kW at 4. 5 K. This is a part of the indigenous helium plant development work going on at IPR, Bhat, Gandhinagar, Gujrat.

An improved ITE and the corresponding cycle are presented. In the new cycle, the ITE not only acts as an expansion device with work extraction, but also serves as an economizer with vapor injection.

A novel method to predict the rotor passage velocity distribution also enables the rotor passage to be effectively designed to ensure a smooth expansion without requiring CFD analysis. The design method is used to construct two test turbines with target isentropic total-to-static efficiencies of 85 %.

40|$|Most of {{the natural}} gas reaches its end users through {{transmission}} and distribution pipelines. Transmission pipelines operate at high pressures. In a place of consumption or at passing into a lower pressure pipeline {{the pressure of the}} gas must be reduced. This pressure reduction takes place in places which called City Gate Stations (CGS). In CGSs the pressure must be reduced from 5 - 7 MPa to 1. 5 - 2. 0 MPa (usually to 1. 7 MPa) into high pressure intrastate pipeline, then to approximately 0. 3 MPa into medium pressure intrastate pipeline. In this study, based on a comprehensive program, Inlet and outlet properties of natural gas flow and daily flow rate through a typical CGS were measured and recorded for a whole year. Based on this data recording, the amount of electricity which can be produced from natural gas pressure has been calculated when utilizing a turbo-expander.
