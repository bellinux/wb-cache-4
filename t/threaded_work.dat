40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the best way}} to handle a diverse mix of multi-threaded and single-threaded jobs running on a single Symmetric Parallel Processing system. The traditional approaches to this problem are free scheduling, gang scheduling, or space sharing. This paper examines a less common technique called dynamic space sharing. One approach to dynamic space sharing, Automatic Self Allocating Threads (ASAT), is compared to all of the traditional approaches to scheduling a mixed load of jobs. Performance results for ASAT scheduling, gang scheduling, and free scheduling are presented. ASAT scheduling is shown to be the superior approach to mixing multi-threaded work with single <b>threaded</b> <b>work.</b> 1. Introduction When a parallel processing system is processing a mix of different types of jobs, some scheduling approach is needed so that the overall utilization of the system is maximized. Operating systems on Symmetric Multiprocessors are generally capable of handling a large number of competi [...] ...|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} kind of drawn <b>thread</b> <b>work</b> is hemstitching. Drawn <b>thread</b> <b>work</b> {{is often used}} to {{decorate}} the trimmings of clothes or household linens.

50|$|Cutwork {{is related}} to drawn <b>thread</b> <b>work.</b> In drawn <b>thread</b> <b>work,</b> {{typically}} only the warp or weft threads are withdrawn (cut and removed), and the remaining threads in the resulting hole are bound in various ways. In other types of cutwork, both warp and weft threads may be drawn.|$|R

50|$|Drawn <b>thread</b> <b>work</b> {{is a form}} of counted-thread {{embroidery}} {{based on}} removing threads from the warp and/or the weft of a piece of even-weave fabric. The remaining threads are grouped or bundled together into a variety of patterns. The more elaborate styles of drawn <b>thread</b> <b>work</b> use a variety of other stitches and techniques, but the drawn thread parts are their most distinctive element. It is also grouped as whitework embroidery because it was traditionally done in white thread on white fabric and is often combined with other whitework techniques.|$|R

50|$|Later blackwork {{features}} large {{designs of}} flowers, fruit, and other patterns connected by curvilinear stems. These are frequently not counted <b>thread</b> <b>work</b> and are outlined with stem stitch, and the outlined patterns {{are filled with}} geometric counted designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{stitches}} {{used for}} counted thread blackwork are double running or holbein stitch, backstitch, and sometimes stem stitch. Historically {{it was done}} on plain weave fabric. Modern stitchers often use even weave fabric made especially for counted <b>thread</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R

50|$|In hemstitching, {{one or more}} threads {{are drawn}} out of the fabric {{parallel}} and next to the turned hem, and stitches bundle the remaining threads {{in a variety of}} decorative patterns while securing the hem in place. Multiple rows of drawn <b>thread</b> <b>work</b> may be used.|$|R
