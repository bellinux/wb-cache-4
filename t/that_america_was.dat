25|$|In 1896, the National Bureau of Criminal Identification was founded, which {{provided}} agencies {{across the country}} with information to identify known criminals. The 1901 assassination of President William McKinley created a perception <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> under threat from anarchists. The Departments of Justice and Labor had been keeping records on anarchists for years, but President Theodore Roosevelt wanted more power to monitor them.|$|E

25|$|Romney and Huntsman clashed over China, with Romney saying <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> in {{the middle}} of a trade war with China, who must be taken to the World Trade Organization over {{currency}} manipulation. Huntsman replied that China can't be taken to the WTO and starting a trade war with them would be bad for the American economy. The debate itself was criticised for not spending sufficient time on the Eurozone crisis, with only the very last question devoted to it, which only Huntsman was given the opportunity to answer.|$|E
25|$|According to McKay’s autobiographies A Long Way From Home and My Green Hills of Jamaica, {{he claimed}} the black {{intellectual}} {{was drawn to}} the Communist party because it offered independence. McKay believed that the Communists in the US had other things on their agenda, and the African-Americans were not part of that at all. He also thought that they were using the Negro race to fight their battles. Because of his thoughts on communism in America, he sought out help from Russia. He addressed the Communists in Russia with his speech “Report on the Negro Question” and argued <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> not fully accepting of the Negro Communists.|$|E

As Chomsky [...] . has recently demonstrated, this is an argument associated with the left. But it does not always come from that section of the political spectrum. The claim <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>is</b> an empire has also been made from within the American right, and in two sharply different ways. For some, <b>America</b> <b>is</b> imperialist and must be stopped from being so. For others, however, it is imperialist {{and this is something}} to be applauded. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{campaign}} in North America {{did nothing to}} shake the common Whig belief <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> to be won by defeating France in Europe. However, the failure at Quebec was somewhat compensated by Marlborough's final victory in the field. Anne's Captain-General {{no longer had the}} influence he enjoyed under the Godolphin ministry: his wife's relationship with the Queen had ended acrimoniously and he was now under the influence of Harley, now the Earl of Oxford and Lord High Treasurer. Nevertheless, Marlborough still commanded the Anglo-Dutch forces in northern France, and in August he outmanoeuvred Villars and crossed the formidable Ne Plus Ultra lines, before capturing Bouchain on 12 September. The campaign was not decisive, however. Arras, Cambrai, Le Quesnoy, and Landrecies still stood between the Duke and Paris, and it would take at least one more campaign to secure their capitulation.|$|E
25|$|Though Italy did offer {{substantial}} aid, some German assistance also trickled through. After {{asking the}} new German Consul-General, Hans Döhle on 21 July 1937 for support, the Abwehr briefly made {{an exception to}} its policy and gave some limited aid. But this was aimed to exert pressure on Britain over Czechoslovakia. Promised arms shipments never eventuated. This {{was not the only}} diplomatic front on which al-Husseini was active. A month after his visit to Döhle, he wrote to the American Consul George Wadsworth (August 1937), to whom he professed his belief <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> remote from imperialist ambitions and therefore able to understand that Zionism 'represented a hostile and imperialist aggression directed against an inhabited country’. In a meeting with Wadsworth on 31 August, he expressed his fears that Jewish influence in the United States might persuade the country to side with Zionists. In the same period he courted the French government by expressing a willingness to assist them in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Crown of Castile {{organized}} the expedition of Christopher Columbus {{to compete with}} Portugal for the spice trade with Asia, but instead, landed in a New World. The search for a route to Asia was resumed a few years later, after explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 {{and became the first}} European to sight the Pacific Ocean from the New World, confirming <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> a separate continent. The Spanish crown then prepared a great westward voyage with Ferdinand Magellan, in order to reach Asia from Spain across the Atlantic, and then Pacific Oceans. On October 21, 1520, his expedition crossed the strait that bears his name in the southern tip of South America, opening the Pacific to European exploration. On March 16, 1521, the ships reached the Philippines and soon after the Spice Islands, ultimately resulting in the Manila Galleon trade, the first westward spice trade route to Asia.|$|E

500|$|The 1920s were {{a time of}} {{modernization}} for America. Use of electricity became increasingly common. Mass production of the motor car stimulated other industries, as well, such as highway construction, rubber, steel, and building, as hotels were erected to accommodate the tourists venturing upon the roads. This economic boost helped bring the nation out of the recession. To improve and expand the nation's highway system, Harding signed the Federal Highway Act of 1921. From 1921 to 1923, the federal government spent $162million on America's highway system, infusing the U.S. economy with {{a large amount of}} capital. In 1922, Harding proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> {{in the age of the}} [...] "motor car", which [...] "reflects our standard of living and gauges the speed of our present-day life." ...|$|E

[...] Jon Meacham, reviewing the book for The New York Times, called the book [...] "illuminating", writing that it goes [...] "beyond the familiar critique of the founding to explore a point that remains underappreciated: <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> constructed to foster arguments, not to settle them". Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times also praised the book, writing that [...] "It is Ellis's achievement that he leaves us with a keen appreciation of the good fortune America had in having the right men {{in the right places}} at the right times".|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot of}} Friday Night Lights {{received}} good to middling reviews. Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times gave the episode {{a very good}} review, and suggested the series could {{be good enough to}} transcend the medium of television. She praised the [...] "intelligent performances" [...] of the actors, and though she found the [...] "Smash" [...] Williams character less convincing than the others, she thought it improved towards the end. She also appreciated the use of audio to tell the story: the buzz of a surgeon's saw or the sound of skin stuck to leather. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club, wrote [...] "I appreciate the feel for the high stakes attached to small-market school sports, the knowing take on the high-school caste system, and the details of family life." [...] Still, he worried <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> [...] "failing to fall in love with" [...] the show, and expressed doubts as to whether it would be allowed to survive.|$|E
500|$|The Year Zero story {{takes place}} in the United States in the year 2022; or [...] "Year 0" [...] {{according}} to the American government, being the year <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> reborn. The United States has suffered several major terrorist attacks, and in response the government has seized absolute control on the country and reverted to a Christian fundamentalist theocracy. The government maintains control of the populace through institutions such as the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano, as well as increased surveillance and the secret drugging of tap water with a mild sedative. In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authoritarian government. The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn the American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Henry College {{is located}} in the town of Purcellville in rural {{northern}} Virginia, approximately [...] northwest of Washington D.C.

The oldest structure, Founders Hall, opened in 2000 and contains three classrooms, the college library, and various administrative and faculty offices. It is also home to the offices of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Hanna Rosin, author of God's Harvard, described the campus as [...] "tiny, less like an Ivy League college than like a Hollywood set of an old Ivy League school." [...] The buildings are of Colonial Revival architecture. The artwork in Founders Hall consists of copies of portraits of the Founding Fathers placed along a staircase, leading to a picture of Patrick Henry at the second Virginia convention which features a light from heaven guiding Henry's speech.

500|$|Foreign journalists {{had been}} {{deported}} from East Pakistan {{shortly before the}} Pakistani army's Operation Searchlight, and even after Mascarenhas' first-hand observations had been published, Shankar and Harrison were concerned that the mainstream media in the West were showing a reluctance to report all the facts. That summer, it also emerged <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> supporting General Khan's military offensive, both financially and with weaponry – despite the Blood telegram in April, in which officials at the US Consulate in Dacca advised their State Department of the [...] "genocide" [...] taking place and accused the US Government of [...] "moral bankruptcy". Realising the need to create greater awareness {{of the situation in}} Bangladesh, and particularly the refugee camps of India that had become [...] "infectious open-air graveyards" [...] with the outbreak of cholera, Harrison quickly composed a song for the cause. [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] was [...] "written in ten minutes at the piano", he would later recall.

500|$|Politically, as Bangladeshi {{historian}} Farida Majid would note, the [...] "warmth, {{care and}} goodwill" [...] of the August 1971 concerts [...] "echoed {{all over the}} world", inspiring volunteers to approach UNICEF and offer their assistance, as well as eliciting private donations to the Bangladesh disaster fund. Although the altruistic spirit would soon wane once more, the Concert for Bangladesh is invariably seen as the inspiration and model for subsequent rock charity benefits, from 1985's Live Aid and Farm Aid to the Concert for New York City and Live 8 in the twenty-first century. Unlike those later concerts, which benefitted from continuous {{media coverage of the}} causes they supported, the Harrison–Shankar project was responsible for identifying the problem and establishing Bangladesh's plight in the minds of mainstream Western society. According to Gary Tillery: [...] "Because of its positioning as a humanitarian effort, all descriptions of the show included a summary of the catastrophe in South Asia. Overnight, because of their fascination with rock stars, masses of people became educated about geopolitical events they had not even been aware of the week before. The tragedy in Bangladesh moved to the fore as an international issue." [...] One of these revelations was <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> supplying weaponry and financial aid to the Pakistani army, led by General Yahya Khan.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder <b>that</b> <b>America</b> <b>was</b> clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E
