40|$|We {{examined}} the photocontrol of seed germination in the phyA/phyB double mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. Dormant phyA/phyB seeds showed a red/far-red light (R/FR) -reversible induction of seed germination. This suggests {{the involvement of}} at least one other phytochrome, phyC, D, and/or E, in controlling seed germination. We designated this spectrally active phytochrome in phyA/phyB as phyX. The full reversibility of the R-induced germination by subsequent FR pulses, and the observation that the response is reversible by FR, even after a 3 -h R treatment, indicates that <b>this</b> phyX <b>response</b> belongs to the low-fluence-response type. Thus, <b>this</b> phyX <b>response</b> is functionally related to phyB-mediated responses. However, in contrast to phyB-controlled seed germination, <b>this</b> phyX-mediated <b>response</b> needs a prolonged imbibition period and exhibits reversibility kinetics different from that needed for phyB. Furthermore, <b>this</b> phyX <b>response</b> requires a prolonged irradiation time and shows a fluence rate response dependency, showing a similarity to the high irradiance response of photomorphogenesis. Thus, phyX, with regard to its control of seed germination, is a functionally new phytochrome that shares some characteristics of both phyA- and phyB-mediated responses...|$|R

5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. <b>This</b> <b>response</b> is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E

5|$|In humans, <b>this</b> <b>response</b> is {{activated}} by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
