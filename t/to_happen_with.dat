25|$|The Christian {{view of the}} New Covenant is a new {{relationship}} between God and humans mediated by Jesus which necessarily includes all people, both Jews and Gentiles, upon sincere declaration that one believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and God. The New Covenant also breaks the generational curse of the original sin on all children of Adam if they believe in Jesus Christ, after people are judged for their own sins, which is expected <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> the second arrival of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|A {{second stage}} freeze {{is also likely}} <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> the valve open, causing a free flow, which may {{precipitate}} a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the flow through the frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is fitted with a shutoff valve, {{but if this is}} done, the first stage must be fitted with an overpressure valve, as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as an overpressure valve.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E

25|$|Anal sex can expose its {{participants}} to two principal dangers: infections {{due to the}} high number of infectious microorganisms not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility. Unprotected penile-anal penetration, colloquially known as barebacking, carries a higher risk of passing on sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs) because the anal sphincter is a delicate, easily torn tissue that can provide an entry for pathogens. The high concentration of white blood cells around the rectum, together with the risk of tearing and the colon's function to absorb fluid, are what place those who engage in anal sex at high risk of STIs. Use of condoms, ample lubrication {{to reduce the risk of}} tearing, and safer sex practices in general, reduce the risk of STI transmission. However, a condom can break or otherwise come off during anal sex, and this is more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> anal sex than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction.|$|E

Isaac informs him that Manya had {{forgotten}} Jerry made the pony remark: [...] "Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad." [...] Elaine asks Isaac multiple times {{about what is going}} <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> their apartment. Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry's cousin Jeffrey is going to live in it. When it starts to rain, Jerry realizes that the game will be postponed. The following day, after the game, Jerry, George and Elaine meet at Monk's Café, where they discuss the lousy way Jerry played softball. (Jerry recalls a certain play, about which he admits, [...] "It was the single worst moment of my life.") Elaine wonders if Manya's spirit put a spell on him.|$|E

During the 1980s, Vidacable TV Systems leased part of the mountain from the JMC to set up an antenna. Cellular One considered building a [...] cell tower on top of Joppenbergh in 1992, but decided not to do so. Although there was public opposition to the proposal, Cellular One stated that local sentiment was not a factor in its decision against building the tower. In 1995 the mountain was studied by the New York Public Service Commission to determine a possible route for new transmission lines laid by a local energy utility.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by series creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in their second episode for this season, and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, also his second episode this season, {{during the course of}} the second production season. This episode was based on a remark David once made during a conversation. Cherones deliberately made Elaine sit at a smaller table while directing the dinner scene. [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was the first episode in which Kramer wants to gamble, it is later established that he has a gambling addiction. The idea of Elaine asking Isaac what is going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> his old apartment was added during rehearsals. The first table reading of the episode was held on October 24, 1990, and a run through was held two days later.

Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording {{a new album}} with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} the album Hu Hu Hu (2009) Lafourcade experienced writer's block, {{and felt that}} the songs she was writing were too {{similar to those in}} her previous albums.

She said she was a Mexican and proud of the [...] "very many" [...] positive parts it has. Musically, she wanted more simplicity in her songs. Lafourcade forced herself to write [...] "without judgement", recording voice memos on her phone as part of the writing process. She was inspired by the works of Latin American songwriters such as Simón Díaz, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Chavela Vargas, and Caetano Veloso. While recording demos, Lafourcade realized that the songs were more direct and emotional than her previous work. The writing took three years, resulting in approximately 30songs. Since the album was about her personal life, she selected what she felt were [...] "the strongest ones", saying, [...] "more than making an album, I wanted to have songs... that could stand on their own".|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Christian Svensson at Capcom {{said that}} there were no plans at the time to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 in regions outside Japan, due to higher {{localization}} costs than estimated returns; according to Eshiro, however, the main reason for the lack of a localization was scheduling, as all the staff working on the game had disbanded and moved to different teams after finishing the game, and were unable to work on a localization. Svensson {{said that there}} was a possibility of a release on another platform, and that he would discuss ways for it <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> Capcom's strategy and R teams. In December 2011, Capcom was still discussing internally how to address the Ace Attorney audience, with Svensson saying that there is potential to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 as a downloadable digital title. The game's potential English release was still discussed internally at Capcom in March 2012, but in January 2013, Svensson said that while Ace Attorney Investigations 2 still was talked about at Capcom, all their Ace Attorney resources, especially ones related to localization, were focused on the then-upcoming [...]|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them.

In April 2015, Feige confirmed the character would be Peter Parker and added that Marvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the MCU since at least October 2014, when they announced their full slate of Phase Three films, saying, [...] "Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone.

The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of Air, saying [...] "Like Air, the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike Air, however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny." [...] Martin also compares Kanon to the anime adaptation of Shuffle! which is described as [...] "bombing" [...] where Kanon [...] "works". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters [...] "endear themselves to the viewer...far better than what Shuffle!s do." [...] Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as {{a defining feature of}} the series. However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it [...] "overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times" [...] causing little <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> the plot. Yuichi is described as being [...] "too erratic to be fully credible" [...] or easily believable. Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as [...] "one of the best moe-centric series to date" [...] and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making Kanon [...] "one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year".
