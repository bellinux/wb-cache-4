Some reviewers believed Chris' over-the-top personality would be funny in the short run, but that the character would not prove three-dimensional enough to have long-term sustainability. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell initially described him as [...] "funny, but sorta one-note", and Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic first found Chris funny, but likewise said he was [...] "not sure how great he'll be long term". Matt Fowler of IGN expressed the same sentiments after earlier episodes, but by the third season said Chris {{proved to be a}} great addition to the show.|$|E

Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E

500|$|Séguret {{said the}} film {{presented}} a solid recreation of the era, but that Eastwood {{did not seem}} inspired by the challenge. Séguret noted that Eastwood kept the embers of the story alight, but that it seldom burst into flames. He likened the experience to being in a luxury car: comfortable yet boring. Denby and Ansen commented that Eastwood left the worst atrocities to audiences' imaginations. Ansen said this was because Eastwood was less interested in the lurid aspects of the case. McCarthy praised the thoughtful, unsensationalized treatment, while Denby cited problems with the austere approach, saying it left the film [...] "both impressive and monotonous". He said Eastwood was presented {{with the problem of}} not wanting to exploit the [...] "gruesome" [...] material because this would contrast poorly with the delicate emotions of a woman's longing for her missing son. Denby said Eastwood and Straczynski should have explored more deeply the story's perverse aspects. Instead, he said, the narrative methodically settled the emotional and dramatic issues—"reverently chronicling Christine's apotheosis"—before [...] " [...] on for another forty minutes". Ansen said the classical approach lifted the story <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>level,</b> and that it embraced horror film conventions only in the process of transcending them. McCarthy said Changeling was one of Eastwood's most vividly realized films, noting Stern's cinematography, the set and costume design, and CGI landscapes that merged seamlessly with location shots. Dargis was not impressed by the production design; she cited the loss of Eastwood's regular collaborator Henry Bumstead—who died in 2006—as a factor in Changelings [...] "overly pristine" [...] look.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} songs that was {{recorded}} for the album was [...] "Fantasy". While Carey began developing new ideas for Daydream, {{she thought of the}} song [...] "Genius of Love" [...] by Tom Tom Club. She had always been a fan of the song, and presented Dave Hall with the idea of sampling the song's hook. Hall incorporated a groove that he felt complimented Carey's voice, while she composed some of the other beats and wrote the lyrics. Carey recorded a remix to the song as well, featuring hip-hop verses from O.D.B of the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as production from Puffy. She spoke highly of the remix, complimenting Puffy and O.D.B, [...] "He's so known in the street, and he's one of the best people out there...we kind of did what we both do and having O.D.B took it <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>level.</b> He was my ultimate choice, so I was really happy with the way it turned out." [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] was a song that Carey wrote with the R group Boyz II Men. After Carey's friend and past collaborator David Cole died, she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life's journey. Carey had the chorus and concept composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, as well as the melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song. It was produced by Afanasieff, who built on the song's melody and added various grooves and beats.|$|E
500|$|Another deleted scene {{involved}} Bruce {{waking up}} after being {{shot in the}} head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the Batmobile was, and Alfred says, [...] "Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave." [...] The platform then rotates downward <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>level</b> where the sonar-modification equipment is kept, from the special Batsuit to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father's red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written 'even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week'. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by Rick Baker, {{who was in charge of}} the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.|$|E
