40|$|AbstractDue to the {{constitutive}} {{property of}} soil, soil strength {{is generally considered}} as a difficult problem. This paper, by establishing the soil granular-structure model and using granules’connecting points to reflect the soil structure, analyzes the mechanical and fracture characteristics of the <b>connecting</b> <b>points</b> of granules. 7 yield models are obtained in this paper. Through introduction {{of the concept of}} Vornornoi domain associated with the <b>connecting</b> <b>points</b> of granules, the strength of granules’ <b>connecting</b> <b>points</b> is transformed to the stress intensity in statistical domain. This is the basis for the analysis of the strength of structured soil in this paper. It's found that the stress intensity of soil {{is directly related to the}} connecting strength of granules and the distributional pattern of granules’ <b>connecting</b> <b>points.</b> When the family of stress intensity curves generated in the statistical domain are observed and studied as a point on a macroscopic scale, the conclusion that there are multiple yield surfaces can be naturally obtained. Theoretically, this solves the theoretical problems associated with multiple yield surfaces. Stress gradient may also affect soil strength, which cannot be explained by the past classical theories...|$|R
