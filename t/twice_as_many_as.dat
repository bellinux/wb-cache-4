5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF was down to just 300 serviceable fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines serviceable, with another 289 at storage units and 84 at training units. These resources were included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe prepared for a major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E

Meanwhile, the left-wing OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 million).|$|E

Director Yukio Futatsugi stated that Saga was the most difficult Panzer Dragoon game to develop, as full 3D environments and voice acting were unusual for RPGs at the time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of the 19th century and {{the first years of the}} 20th, the {{escalation}} in the building of battleships became an arms race between Britain and Germany. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power. Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the United States and Japan. Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Chile and Brazil all had second-rate fleets led by armored cruisers, coastal defence ships or monitors.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> the nerve endings found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E

25|$|Bilevel {{trains are}} {{claimed to be}} more energy efficient, and may have a lower {{operating}} cost per passenger.

However, a bilevel train may take longer to exchange passengers at each station, since more people will enter and exit from each car.

25|$|For the Spanish period, in 1684 the Prince of Chimay had 2,600 {{soldiers}} {{under his}} command (1,700 infantry and 900 cavalry).

In 1655, in the upper town alone, a third of the 660 soldiers were listed as married, and about half of these families had children. Then there were also the servants employed by the officers.
