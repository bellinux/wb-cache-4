It is alike {{difficult}} to obtain, transport, and raise, block shafts {{more than ten}} or twelve feet long, except in remarkable positions, and as pieces of singular magnificence. Large pillars are therefore always composed {{of more than one}} block of stone. Such pillars are either jointed like basalt columns, and composed of solid pieces of stone set one above another; or they are filled up towers, built of small stones cemented into a mass, with more or less of regularity: Keep this distinction carefully in mind, it is of great importance; for the jointed column, every stone composing which, however thin, is (so to speak) a complete slice of the shaft, is just as strong as the block pillar of one stone, so long as no forces are brought into action upon it which would have a tendency to cause horizontal dislocation. But the pillar which is built as a filled-up tower is of course liable <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> in any direction, if its cement give way.|$|E

5000|$|From 1633 [...] {{gunpowder}} {{was used}} both for ore extraction and for driving gangways. This increased the daily headway considerably, {{from a few}} centimetres into the lode to a metre or more. The disadvantage, however, was that even more wood was needed to extend the mine, because blasting caused the rock <b>to</b> <b>fissure.</b> When blasting, first {{a cut in the}} lode was made about 3 metres high and deep and a little less than a metre wide using hammer and chisel. Next one or two transverse boreholes with a 6-7 cm diameter were drilled by hand Usually two-man boring was employed: one turned the borer whilst a second hit it with his sledge. The holes were filled with gunpowder and stuffed with a wooden peg which had a hole for a slow-match wick. Unlike blasting with modern explosive, the stemming had to be wedged in using an iron rod centred on the borehole and a thick wooden prop in a slot (Bühnloch) on the opposite side. This operation frequently led to serious accidents when the gunpowder self-ignited as a result of friction-generated heat. Normal detonation was carried out using cord that had been impregnated with sulphur and gunpowder.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} osseous, chondral and tendinous lesions {{associated with}} fissures of the posterior labrum. To {{better understand the}} pathological processes leading <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> of the posterior labrum. Materials and methods. Retrospective study of 43 CT arthrograms performed in 43 patients that showed a fissure of the posterior labrum. The following associated lesions were noted: osseous and chondral remodeling of the humeral head and/or glenoid and articular surface fissures of the rotator cuff. Based on type of associated lesions, patients were separated into one of four pathological subgroups: posterior instability, posterosuperior or internal impingement, anterior instability and isolated fissure of the posterior labrum. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (37. 2 %) of patients showed posterior instability, 12 (27. 9 %) showed lesions of internal impingement, and 11 (25. 6 %) showed lesions of anterior instability. Only 4 patients (9. 3 %) had an isolated fissure of the posterior labrum. CONCLUSION: Posterior instability, internal impingement and anterior instability are the main pathologies leading <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> of the posterior labrum, which seldom occurs in isolation. Evaluation of these associated lesions allows understanding of the underlying pathological processes leading <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> of the posterior labrum...|$|E

40|$|Rice is a {{hygroscopic}} grain {{that will}} readily gainor lose water {{when it is}} exposed to a moistureadsorbing or desorbing environment. Thismoisture transfer can simultaneously induce tensile and compressive stresses within the kernel and often leads <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> development (Kunze and Hall, 1965; Kunze and Choudhary, 1972). Fissured kernels typically result in broken kernels during handling, packaging, and subsequent processing. Since {{one of the primary}} quality indices in the rice industry is the percentage of whole kernels, the consequences of fissuring are of foremost concern to processors. The degree to which physical damage is incurred by a kernel during moisture sorption is related to the number and extent of fissures created in the kernel. Henderson (1954) indicated that fissured kernels do not necessarily break when milled. Thus, the presence of a fissure in a kernel is not a true measure of strength reduction...|$|E
40|$|Post-mortem {{observations}} {{demonstrated that}} plaque fissure {{was the final}} event leading to coronary thrombosis and occlusion in about two-thirds of cases of sudden coronary death.

Accordingly, elegant imaging modalities have been developed {{in order to identify}} this "holy grail". However, the results of prognostic studies based on the identification of vulnerable plaques have not been encouraging because of the low positive predictive value for major cardiovascular events. This observation is not surprising as the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes is complex and multifactorial. In this review we propose a pathogenetic classification of acute coronary syndromes in the attempt to identify homogeneous groups of patients with a common mechanism of coronary instability which can be identified by using specific biomarkers and imaging techniques, and become a specific therapeutic target...|$|E

40|$|Commercial dryers use multi-pass {{procedures}} toremove {{moisture from}} freshly harvested rice. Between drying passes, the rice {{is held in}} bins fora {{certain period of time}} to allow moisture content (MC) gradients within kernels, created during drying, to subside. This holding process is referred to as tempering. Tempering decreases MC gradients by allowing moisture to migrate from the core to the outer layers of the kernel. The MC gradients cause differential stress inside the kernel, which, if sufficiently large, causes the kernel <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> (Kunze, 1979). Moisture migration during tempering also improves the energy utilization in subsequent drying passes (Steffe and Singh, 1980). Fissured kernels may break during the milling process and will thus reduce head rice yield (HRY).

This {{dissertation}} {{identifies the}} white right-wing in South Africa describing the various sub-groups comprising the movement {{which are more}} numerous and diverse than was commonly accepted. The thesis assumed {{a positive correlation between}} reform and increased support for the right-wing, and that a "hardening of attitudes" took place during the 1988 - 1993 period, with a resurgence of nationalist, racist and right-wing sentiments. This thesis argues that there is a propensity <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> {{on the part of the}} right-wing which gives rise to diverse tactics and areas of concern including resorting to violence to achieve political ends. The potential strengths and weaknesses of the right-wing in the light of this tendency are highlighted. The right-wing can only be understood in terms of the powerful ideologies underlying it, in particular Afrikaner Nationalism and European fascism, and this study explores these influences. However, it was felt that a new theoretical framework needed to be elaborated in order better to understand the motivation behind and roots of support for right-wing ideas. Such a theoretical framework needs to integrate both the objective/material and the subjective/ideological and psychological determinants in order to be all encompassing and holistic in its thrust...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a computerized method to automatically find and label the cortical surface in three-dimensional (3 -D) magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. The approach we take is to model a prelabeled brain atlas {{as a physical}} object and give it elastic properties, allowing it to warp itself onto regions in a preprocessed image. Preprocessing consists of boundary-finding and a morphological procedure which automatically extracts the brain and sulci from an MR image and provides a smoothed representation of the brain surface to which the deformable model can rapidly converge. Our deformable models are energy-minimizing elastic surfaces that can accurately locate image features. The models are parameterized with 3 -D bicubic B-spline surfaces. We design the energy function such that cortical fissure (sulci) points on the model are attracted <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> points on the image and the remaining model points are attracted to the brain surface. A conjugate gradient method minimizes the energy function, allowing the model to automatically converge to the smoothed brain surface. Finally, labels are propagated from the deformed atlas onto the high-resolution brain surface. Index Terms—Brain atlas, deformable surface models, feature extraction, matching. I...|$|E

This {{study was designed to}} show the efficacy of gonyautoxin infiltration in healing patients with anal fissures. METHODS: Gonyautoxin is a paralyzing phytotoxin produced by dinoflagellates. Fifty recruited patients received clinical examination, including proctoscopy and questionnaire to evaluate the symptoms. Anorectal manometries were performed before and after toxin injection. Doses of 100 units of gonyautoxin in a volume of 1 ml were infiltrated into both sides of the anal fissure in the internal anal sphincter. RESULTS: Total remission of acute and chronic anal fissures were achieved within 15 and 28 days respectively. Ninety-eight percent of the patients healed before 28 days with a mean time healing of 17. 6 +/- 9 days. Only one relapsed during 14 months of follow-up. Neither fecal incontinence nor other side effects were observed. All patients showed immediate sphincter relaxation. The maximum anal resting pressures recorded after two minutes decreased to 56. 2 +/- 12. 5 percent of baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Gonyautoxin breaks the vicious circle of pain and spasm that leads to anal fissure.

40|$|High daytime {{temperatures}} {{during the}} grain filling stage in rice have negative impacts on milling quality traits. In this study, we used growth chambers {{to evaluate the}} influence of high daytime temperature (33 °C) during grain filling, together with grain moisture content at harvest (26 %, 18 % and 15 %), on grain fissure formation. Varietal susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> formation was also evaluated by exposing grains to high temperature at different grain filling stages (milky, dough, maturing). Two fissure resistant varieties: Cypress (long-grain) and Reiziq (medium-grain) and susceptible varieties: YC 53 - 00 - 7 (long-grain) and Baru (medium-grain) were compared. The average head rice yield (HRY) of Cypress declined from 62. 7 % at 25 °C to 53. 5 % at 33 °C, while Reiziq declined from 56. 2 % (25 °C) to 47. 4 % (33 °C). Both {{were significantly higher than}} the HRY of YC 53 - 00 - 7 (39. 2 % and 24. 9 %) and Baru (39. 3 % and 31. 7 %) at 25 °C and 33 °C, respectively. When grains were drier at harvest (15 % cf. 26 %) there was a greater reduction in HRY. When the four varieties were exposed to high temperature, the highest average reduction of HRY was recorded at 21 days after heading. It is important to choose an optimal sowing date to avoid coincidence of the final grainfilling stage with high temperatures, in order to minimize milling quality losses...|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} fissure preparation {{procedures were}} tested and {{compared to the}} non-invasive approach using a conventional unfilled sealant and a flowable composite. Eighty permanent molars were selected and divided into 4 groups of 20 teeth each. All the teeth were split into 2 halves, and the exposed fissures were photographed under a microscope (35 x) before and after being prepared using the following methods: (I) Er:YAG laser (KEY Laser, KaVo) 600 mJ pulse energy, 6 Hz; (II) diamond bur; (III) Er: YAG laser (KEY Laser, KaVo) 200 mJ pulse energy, 4 Hz; (IV) Control group: Powder jet cleaner (Prophyflex, KaVo, Germany). The pre-and postimages were superimposed in order to evaluate the amount of hard tissue removed. Ten teeth in each group were then acid etched and sealed with an unfilled sealant (Delton opaque, Dentsply), while the remaining 10 teeth were acid etched, primed and bonded (Prime; Bond NT, Dentsply) and sealed with a flowable composite (X-flow, DeTrey, Dentsply). Material penetration and microleakage were evaluated after thermocycling (5000 cycles) and staining with methylene blue 5 %. ANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests were applied for statistical analysis.

40|$|Recently, self-etching fissure {{sealants}} {{have been}} introduced to reduce technical sensitivity; however, their efficacy should be assessed. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess of the microshear bond strength of self-etching and conventional fissure sealants. Thirty non-carious third molars were randomly divided into three groups (N= 10). Microcylinders of Concise fissure sealant were bonded to prepared buccal and lingual surfaces using the two following procedures. In the first group, phosphoric acid was used to prepare the substrate; whereas in group two, Concise was used in combination with Prompt L-Pop. In group 3, a self-etching fissure sealant (Enamel Loc) was utilized per se. After 24 hours, the samples were subjected to 500 rounds of thermocycling and shear bond testing using a microtensile tester machine with a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measure ANOVA and Bonferroni Post HOC tests (SPSS version 16). THE MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF MICROSHEAR BOND STRENGTH OF THE GROUPS WERE AS FOLLOWS: Group 1 : Concise+ etching (14. 59 ± 1. 19 MPa), Group 2 : Concise+Prompt L-Pop (12. 86 ± 1. 98 MPa), and Group 3 : Enamel Loc (5. 59 ± 0. 72 MPa).

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Eighty enamel surface samples were prepared from 40 extracted human third molar teeth. Samples were randomly divided into 8 subgroups according <b>to</b> <b>fissure</b> sealants, conditioning methods and polymerization modes (n= 10); Group 1 : Acid + BS+ Xtra power mode, Group 2 : Primer + BS + Xtra power mode, Group 3 : Acid + BS + Standard mode, Group 4 : Primer + BS + Standard mode, Group 5 : Acid + UH + Xtra power mode, Group 6 : Primer + UH + Xtra power mode, Group 7 : Acid + UH + Standard mode, Group 8 : Primer + UH + Standard mode. An Instron machine (1. 0 mm/min) {{was used to measure}} shear bond strength values. Data were statistically analyzed by using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Significant differences were detected between the groups (p< 0. 05). Shear bond strength values of all BS subgroups were significantly lower than UH subgroups (p< 0. 05). Highest shear bond strength values were obtained in Group 5 and the lowest was obtained in Group 1.
