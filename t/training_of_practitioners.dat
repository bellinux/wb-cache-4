40|$|Improving {{health in}} Canada is a {{challenge}} that involves more than the discovery of new treat-ments and the generation of new knowledge of dis-ease.

40|$|Our {{research}} aims at the mechanised {{treatment of}} ERTMS/ETCS specifications. The potential impact is twofold. On one hand, this will enable tools and techniques {{that can be}} used by manufacturers to automatically check the conformance of their equipment (on-board, track-side) with the operation requirements, prior to on-track testing. On the other hand, the use of these tools can also help in the design and validation of new operation procedures that somehow interact with the standards. We show a transformation of UML models of ERTMS/ETCS into Uppaal specifications that can then be used to analyse complex behavioural properties. Apart from the expected results, such as clarifying core elements, dispelling uncertainties, <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>practitioners,</b> and resolution of ambiguities, a valuable product can be automatically obtained: test cases.

40|$|Background Challenges for {{practitioners}} {{who work with}} parents with intellectual disability arise from several sources. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to identify the stressors experienced by practitioners who work with parents with intellectual disability in Australia, investigate coping strategies and explore training needs so as to inform professional development for this group. Materials and Methods Fifty-eight, predominantly female Australian practitioners, completed a questionnaire, which included a demographics section and training questions (developed specifically for this study), in addition to the Mental Health Professionals Stress Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Brief COPE. Results The main stressors experienced by practitioners were workload, client-related difficulties and organizational structure and processes. Although practitioners indicated that they required additional training in 15 areas, one area was highlighted as particularly important, that is, tailoring interventions to individual parent needs and goals. Conclusions It is suggested that managers, service planners, educators and professionals involved in stress reduction be aware that this area may be the focal point of future <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>practitioners</b> who work with parents with intellectual disability...|$|E

40|$|VTI utilises a {{combination}} of case-study, role playing and action research methodologies whereby the student becomes the virtual diplomat. By assuming the diplomat’s role through VTI, students are provided with opportunities to intellectually engage with a ‘real world’ issue and work towards a ‘real world’ solution. In order to achieve the above outcomes, the VTI experience relies on the investigation of a real world, complex, near-unsolvable, multi-party issue. In essence, the use of VTI ensures that students who take this diplomacy class recognise that the learning experience is not random. The class and the exercises therein, have been carefully crafted to ensure that learning pedagogies are sound for the student. The students also recognise that the class reflects a changed world for international relations and diplomacy; a world where practitioners in this field need to be {{equipped to deal with}} externalities that have hitherto not been imagined.

40|$|Recent policy {{documents}} {{relating to}} people with learning disabilities have proposed that they be more fully included in generic mental health care provision. In practice such inclusion {{has been slow to}} proceed, hampered by factors which appear to include lack of knowledge and confidence on the part of generic mental health practitioners. Policy documents have also recommended <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>practitioners</b> by people with learning disabilities, which has been found to impact positively on confidence and attitudes. This study reports on a training session delivered to ‘Improving Access to Psychological Therapies’ practitioners by a service user with learning disabilities who has accessed mental health services, together with a clinical psychologist and an honorary assistant psychologist. The practitioners were asked to rate their knowledge about and confidence in working with people with learning disabilities before and after the training.
