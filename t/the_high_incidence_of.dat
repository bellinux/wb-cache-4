25|$|It is not {{possible}} to make the diagnosis on imaging studies alone (X-rays and scans), but imaging is routinely performed to assess the full extent of disease. Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere. Australian authorities suggest imaging of the prostate specifically due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> prostatic abscesses in northern Australian patients. A chest X-ray is also considered routine, with other investigations as clinically indicated. The presence of honeycomb abscesses in the liver is considered characteristic, but is not diagnostic.|$|E
25|$|The {{highest rate}} of {{neurological}} problems of single suture synostosis are seen in patients with trigonocephaly. Surgery is performed generally {{before the age of}} one because of claims of better intellectual outcome. Seemingly surgery does not influence <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> neurodevelopment problems in patients with metopic synostosis. Neurological disorders such as ADHD, ASD, ODD and CD are seen in patients with trigonocephaly. These disorders are usually also associated with decreased IQ. The presence of ADHD, ASD and ODD is higher in cases with an IQ below 85. This is not the case with CD which showed an insignificant increase at an IQ below 85.|$|E

25|$|Paroxysmal nocturnal {{hemoglobinuria}} (PNH) is a rare, acquired, life-threatening {{disease of}} the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells by the complement system, {{a part of the}} body's innate immune system. This destructive process occurs due to the presence of defective surface proteins on the red blood cell, which normally function to inhibit such immune reactions. Since the complement cascade attacks the red blood cells within the blood vessels of the circulatory system, the red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) is considered an intravascular hemolytic anemia. Other key features of the disease, such as <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> blood clot formation, are incompletely understood.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> liver transplants {{given to}} those with {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis {{has led to a}} recurring controversy regarding the eligibility of such patients for liver transplant. The controversy stems from the view of alcoholism as a self-inflicted disease and the perception that those with alcohol-induced damage are depriving other patients who could be considered more deserving. It {{is an important part of}} the selection process to differentiate transplant candidates who suffer from alcoholism as opposed to those who were susceptible to non-dependent alcohol use. The latter who gain control of alcohol use have a good prognosis following transplantation. Once a diagnosis of alcoholism has been established, however, it is necessary to assess the likelihood of future sobriety.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people living}} in Haiti {{are at high risk}} for major {{infectious}} diseases. Food or water-borne diseases include bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, typhoid fever and hepatitis A and E; common vector-borne diseases are dengue fever and malaria; water-contact diseases include leptospirosis. Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake. The infant mortality rate in Haiti in 2013 was 55 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to a rate of 6 per 1,000 in other countries.|$|E

25|$|A {{very large}} {{percentage}} of schizophrenics smoke tobacco {{as a form of}} self-medication. The high rate of tobacco use by the mentally ill is a major factor in their decreased life expectancy, which is about 25 years shorter than the general population. Following the observation that smoking improves condition of people with schizophrenia, in particular working memory deficit, nicotine patches had been proposed as a way to treat schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that a link exists between smoking and mental illness, citing <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> smoking amongst those suffering from schizophrenia and the possibility that smoking may alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness, but these have not been conclusive. In 2015, a meta-analysis found that smokers were at greater risk of developing psychotic illness.|$|E
25|$|Carlos Finlay, a Cuban {{doctor and}} scientist, {{proposed}} in 1881 that yellow fever might be transmitted by mosquitoes rather than direct human contact. Since the losses from yellow fever in the Spanish–American War in the 1890s were extremely high, Army doctors began research experiments {{with a team}} led by Walter Reed, composed of doctors James Carroll, Aristides Agramonte, and Jesse William Lazear. They successfully proved Finlay's ″mosquito hypothesis″. Yellow fever was the first virus shown to be transmitted by mosquitoes. The physician William Gorgas applied these insights and eradicated yellow fever from Havana. He also campaigned against yellow fever during the construction of the Panama Canal, after a previous {{effort on the part of}} the French failed (in part due to mortality from <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> yellow fever and malaria, which killed many workers).|$|E
25|$|From {{a sample}} of 129 beluga adults from the Saint Lawrence River {{examined}} between 1983 and 1999, a total of 27% had suffered cancer. This is a higher percentage than that documented for other populations of this species and {{is much higher than}} for other cetaceans and for the majority of terrestrial mammals; in fact, the rate is only comparable to the levels found in humans and some domesticated animals. For example, the rate of intestinal cancer in the sample is much higher than for humans. This condition is thought to be directly related to environmental contamination, in this case by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and coincides with <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> this disease in humans residing in the area. The prevalence of tumours suggests the contaminants identified in the animals that inhabit the estuary are having a direct carcinogenic effect or they are at least causing an immunological deterioration that is reducing the inhabitants' resistance to the disease.|$|E
