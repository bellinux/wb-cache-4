5|$|After {{the third}} Louisville punt, Virginia Tech took over at its 46-yard line. Unlike the {{previous}} second-quarter possessions, which saw the Tech offense struggle {{to move the}} ball effectively, Tech began its drive with a five-yard rush. After losing seven yards on the next play, Marcus Vick completed a 19-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Jeff King, driving the Hokies into Louisville territory {{for the first time}} in the quarter. Two plays later, Vick connected with wide receiver Justin Harper on a 33-yard pass that resulted in the Hokies' first touchdown of the game.

5|$|Buffalo {{began the}} final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 {{situation}} and were unable to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also unable to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls.

Manning started out the drive with a 22-yard completion to Marvin Harrison. His next pass went <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Dallas Clark for 17yards. Two more completions moved {{the ball to the}} Bears' 11-yard line, and then Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16–14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter.|$|E

Texas committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then a long pass downfield fell incomplete. Two more plays failed to gain a first down, and the Hokies punted.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} governance for a sample of successful collaborative inventive activities. We find that firm size and incoming spillovers {{have a positive impact}} on the probability to co-operate.

We find that higher project complexity and technological scope are associated <b>to</b> <b>tighter</b> modes of governance while licensing to less hierarchical ones. Inventor specific characteristics matter too. In particular, experience increases the probability of choosing less hierarchical governance modes while better education is associated <b>to</b> <b>tighter</b> modes...|$|R

5|$|The Giants {{rallied to}} beat the New Orleans Saints 20–17 in front of 72,769 fans at Giants Stadium in week four. They {{came back from a}} 17–0 second quarter deficit, by scoring 20 points in the final three quarters. Rueben Mayes of the Saints {{returned}} the second half kickoff 99yards for an apparent touchdown only to have the play called back because of an illegal block by linebacker Sam Mills. The decisive points came on Phil Simms's 4-yard touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Zeke Mowatt midway through the fourth quarter. The Giants dominated the Saints in time of possession, holding the ball for 38 minutes and 47 seconds to the Saints 21 minutes and 13 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began at}} 12:00PM EST. Connecticut, led by running back Donald Brown's 208yards rushing, {{dominated}} {{the first half}} statistically, but found themselves down 20–10 midway through the second quarter because they committed six fumbles, five of which were recovered by Buffalo. UConn would close the gap to 20–17 by halftime, and take the lead for good late {{in the third quarter}} off a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tyler Lorenzen <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Steve Brouse. The Connecticut victory was sealed when, late in the fourth quarter, Buffalo quarterback Drew Willy threw a pass that was intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston and returned 100yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{a slow and}} perfectionist composer, Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> deadlines. He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced. Of his ballets for Sadler's Wells, The Wise Virgins (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach. The Quest (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams. Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of Façade, the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original. Music from The Quest and {{the whole of the}} Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler's Wells ballet, O.W., in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Kendrick received the kickoff at the Tech goal line and returned it to the 20-yard line, where the Hokies started the first possession of the second half. On the first play, Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty. Suggs gained five yards with a run up the middle, then Vick completed a pass <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Browning Wynn at the 28-yard line. On third down, the Hokies were stopped short of the first down marker and punted {{for only the second}} time in the game. During the kick, Clemson committed a 15-yard roughing the kicker penalty. The penalty allowed the Hokies to retain the football and gave them a first down at their 44-yard line. On the first play after the penalty, Vick completed a 55-yard pass to Davis at the Clemson one-yard line. After the pass, Suggs ran straight ahead for his second touchdown of the game. The extra point was missed by Warley, but Tech still extended its lead to 2710 with 12:19 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Because Miami {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. After Miami's kickoff and a touchback, Tech began the first possession {{of the second half}} at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a quick first down off a rush each by Lawrence, Dovel, and Casey. Lawrence picked up another with two rushes that resulted in 13 yards and drove the Hokies to their 44-yard line. There, Casey completed his longest pass of the game — a 42-yard throw <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Rob Purdham — that gave Tech a first down at the Miami 14-yard line. Tech continued to drive, picking up short yardage with multiple rushes. The Hokies suffered a near-disaster when Lawrence fumbled the ball, but Tech retained possession when the ball rolled out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays after the fumble, Lawrence vaulted over the goal line for Tech's first and only touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech cut Miami's lead to 1410 with 8:52 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Bryan Still fielded the Tennessee kickoff and {{returned}} it to the 19-yard line of Virginia Tech. After a short pass, DeShazo threw his second interception of the game. Tennessee defender John Summers returned the catch to the Tech 19-yard line, and backup quarterback Branndon Stewart returned to the game for Tennessee's offense. James Stewart took the first play of the Volunteers' drive, an eight-yard gain, then backup Jay Graham entered the game {{and ran to the}} five-yard line for a first down. After the next play—, a two-yard run by Graham—Tennessee committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, pushing the Volunteers back to the 17-yard line. Branndon Stewart completed a pass <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end David Horn, pushing Tennessee back to the three-yard line, but not gaining enough for a first down. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort returned to the game, and his 19-yard field goal attempt was good, giving the Volunteers a 4516 lead with 9:41 to go in the game.|$|E

On the next play, Druckenmiller connected with Still for a nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of reach for the Hokies.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{continued}} his fantastic first-half performance on Fresno State's next drive, forcing running back Robbie Rouse to fumble. It was recovered by safety Taylor Reed.

Fresno State finally started {{to put together a}} solid drive {{at the end of the}} half including three consecutive first-down passes from Carr to Isaiah Burse for 16 yards, Greg Watson for 12 yards, and Davante Adams for 33 yards respectively that set up first and goal at the three-yard line with 0:39 remaining in the half. The Bulldogs failed to execute, however, and ended the half without scoring at all. The final play of the half was a pass <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Marcel Jensen in the end zone, but he dropped the ball, thus ending the scoring threat.|$|E
5|$|Iowa State got {{the ball}} to start the game. Their first drive was {{highlighted}} by a 26–yard pass from Sam Richardson to Josh Lenz.

When Tulsa {{got the ball}} back again, Trey Watts rushed the ball for four yards on the first play of the drive, and then Cody Green threw a short pass that was intercepted by defensive back Jeremy Reeves and returned 31 {{yards for a touchdown}} that put Tulsa up 10–0. Tulsa then put together a 9–play, 75–yard drive during which all three running backs: Alex Singleton, Ja'Terian Douglas, and Trey Watts rushed the ball. It was Singleton who rushed for a two-yard touchdown that made the score 10-7. Iowa State's next drive lasted only two plays, but the second was a 69–yard pass from Richardson <b>to</b> <b>tight</b> end Ernst Brun Jr. for a touchdown.
