25|$|Dukkha Samudaya (cause of suffering): Craving, {{which leads}} to Attachment and Bondage, {{is the cause of}} suffering. Formally, this is termed Tanha. It can be {{classified}} into three instinctive drives. Kama Tanha is the Craving for any pleasurable sense object (which involves sight, sound, touch, taste, smell and mental perceptives). Bhava Tanha is the Craving for attachment to an ongoing process, which appears in various forms, including <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for existence. Vibhava Tanha is the Craving for detachment from a process, which includes non-existence and causes <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for self-annihilation.|$|E

25|$|The Tropical waltz was {{performed}} {{in a slower tempo}} and frequently included a sung melody with a text. Those texts usually referred to the beauties of the Cuban countryside, <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> of the Siboneyes (Cuban aboriginee) and other creole themes. With accents on its three beats, its melody was fluid and composed of equal value notes. It was similar to many other songs in which the melody was treated in a syllabic way, where the first beat was not stressed by a brief anacrusis but had a tendency to move toward the second beat like in the peasant (guajiro) song.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War II, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) was in a favourable position. Its powerful influence on Czechoslovak politics since the 1920s, its clean wartime record and cooperation with non-Communist parties, its identification with the Soviet Union, one of the country's liberators, and its determination to become the country's leading political force without alarming the West (a strategy followed too by Communist parties in Italy and France) dovetailed with popular opposition to Nazi rule, <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for real change that followed it, and the new political realities of living within the Soviet orbit to produce a surge in membership from 40,000 in 1945 to 1.35 million in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The Hymns to the Night {{display a}} {{universal}} religion with an intermediary. This concept {{is based on}} the idea that there is always a third party between a human and God. This intermediary can either be Jesus – as in Christian lore – or the dead beloved as in the hymns. These works consist of three times two hymns. These three components are each structured in this way: the first hymn shows, with the help of the Romantic triad, the development from an assumed happy life on earth through a painful era of alienation to salvation in the eternal night; the following hymn tells of the awakening from this vision and <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for a return to it. With each pair of hymns, a higher level of experience and knowledge is shown.|$|E

500|$|A violoncello piccolo {{complements}} the soprano in a recitative, which {{begins as a}} secco recitative, [...] "" [...] (How dear are the gifts of the holy meal), and leads to the fourth stanza of the chorale, [...] "" [...] (Ah, how my spirit hungers), sung in a moderately adorned version of the tune. Bach uses recitative to introduce the chorale by evoking the [...] "gift of communion", while the chorale stanza expresses <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for this gift, mentioning thirst and hunger. The melody sounds sometimes like a new melody, expressing that a personal longing. The violoncello piccolo in continuous motion [...] "envelops the soprano's voice in a quasi womb-like blanketing of divine reassurance",as Mincham phrases it.|$|E
500|$|Across {{the various}} theologies and philosophies, the common theme {{presents}} Krishna as the essence and symbol of divine love, with {{human life and}} love {{as a reflection of}} the divine. <b>The</b> <b>longing</b> and love-filled legends of Krishna and the gopis, his playful pranks as a baby, as well as his later dialogues with other characters, are philosophically treated as metaphors for the human longing for the divine and for meaning, and the play between the universals and the human soul. Krishna's lila is a theology of love-play. According to John Koller, [...] "love is presented not simply as a means to salvation, it is the highest life". Human love is God's love.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "WALL-E: from {{environmental}} adaption to sentimental nostalgia," [...] Robin Murray and Joseph Heuman explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, i.e. Zippo lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items {{that we use}} out of necessity, are made sentimental {{through the lens of}} the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing [...] "Put on Your Sunday Clothes", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.|$|E

500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings {{for the day}} are Isaiah's prophecy of {{the birth}} of the Messiah (...) and from the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus (...) [...] The feast of the Annunciation fell on Palm Sunday in 1725. The unknown librettist retained the first and the last stanza of the hymn, and paraphrased the other stanzas to recitatives and arias, using stanza 2 for the first recitative, stanza 3 for the first aria, stanza 4 and part of stanza 5 for the second recitative, and stanza 6 for the second aria. The hymn, expressing <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for the arrival of the Saviour, can be connected to Jesus' birth being announced to Mary. The theme of arrival was also fitting for Palm Sunday when the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem is celebrated. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr notes: [...] "The librettist must be credited with the empathy he shows for that fervour which characterizes Nicolai's poem and which has made his hymns into an enduring possession of the Protestant Church." [...] While the name of the librettist, a [...] "poetically and theologically competent specialist" [...] is not known, scholars have suggested Andreas Stübel (1653–1725), a former headmaster of the Thomasschule.|$|E
500|$|The BBC's review, {{written by}} Susan Hodgetts, {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "... a superior British costume drama that expertly mixes art history with romantic fiction ...," [...] which would appeal to [...] "... anyone who likes serious, intelligent drama and gentle erotic tension." [...] Hodgetts said that both Firth and Johansson gave [...] "excellent" [...] performances who did [...] "... a grand job of expressing feelings and emotions {{without the use of}} much dialogue, and the picture is the better for it." [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times called the film an [...] "... earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> silences that come after a sigh." [...] Mitchell did however laud its cinematography, production design, and musical score, as did the Film Journal Internationals Erica Abeel. Despite praising its visuals, Abeel criticized Girl with a Pearl Earring for being [...] "... a chick flick dressed up in Old Master clothes ..." [...] and for failing [...] "... to render Griet's growing artistic sensibility dramatically credible." [...] She cited its melodramatic villains as another failing, but concluded that it was [...] "... to Johansson's credit that she alone pulls something plausible out of her character." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{picked it}} as one of Rebel Hearts best songs, calling it [...] "an expert {{evocation}} of her folktronica Y2K." [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone agreed, noting that [...] "Avicii helps Madonna revive the strums-and-beats vibe of 2000's Music." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine went further, calling it [...] "her best song in 15 years". He continued praising [...] "Devil Pray" [...] for [...] "reimagin The Animals as a folktronica band with witch-house tendencies... Her ruminations on salvation and the existential pitfalls of sniffing glue [...] rid an unexpected low-end groove." [...] Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club also saw the song as a highlight, describing it as a [...] "gospel-tinged, acoustic-guitar irresistible plea for salvation and divine guidance in the face of temptations such as drugs." [...] Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound considered [...] "Devil Pray" [...] one of Madonna's best release in years and its chorus as [...] "one of her strongest in decades". She praised [...] "Madonna's voice [...] is pitch-shifted into a ghostly echo— and unlike those 'Bitch' beats, the production slides in perfectly. It's one hell of a song about getting fucked up on every molecule imaginable, but it's also heavy with <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for self-purification and direction." [...] The New York Times also shared this view, noting that the song [...] "showcase some of Madonna's best singing in years." [...] Saeed Saeed of The National felt that the song was similar to The Animals' version of [...] "The House of the Rising Sun" [...] and praised it for being a better country-dance song than Madonna's cover of Don McLean's [...] "American Pie".|$|E

2500|$|Love is Colder than Death [...] {{is a low}} key {{film with}} muted tone, long sequences, non-naturalistic acting and little dialogue. Success was not immediate. Love is Colder than Death was ill-received at its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival.

2500|$|Eating {{disorders}} expert Margo D.

Such father hunger, as prompted by paternal absence, may leave the daughter with an unhealthy kind of narcissism, and with a prevalent search for external sources of self-esteem. Maine further examined <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> that all children have for connection with fathers, and how an unmet father hunger influences disordered eating and other mental illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrics {{that relate}} to the Israeli experience. As one might expect in a country that has faced major wars and {{military}} conflicts since its inception, army life and wars are common themes in Israeli songwriting. Interestingly, very few of the war songs are marching songs, and none denigrate the Arab enemies. [...] Most are melancholy, focusing on separation and loss during war, and <b>the</b> <b>longing</b> for peace. Many songs are about pioneering, building up the land, and love of hiking and nature. Others are based on biblical texts. A typical pioneer marching song is Anu Nihiyeh HaRishonim (We will be the first), with words by Yosef Haftman to a traditional melody.|$|E
