The bottom-contact system is less prone to derangement by snow than top contact.|$|E
25|$|Although Gremlins share {{numerous}} {{parts and}} components with other AMC models, finding parts for a restoration project can be difficult. This {{is exacerbated by}} the fact that many Gremlins were chopped up during the late 1970s and the 1980s to make dirt-track racers. The body of choice on the dirt circuit was the Gremlin and AMC Eagle. The subcompact bodies fit Modified chassis and of special interest was the Gremlin's slab <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> with a contour that was easy to duplicate in sheet metal.|$|E

25|$|The {{wing of the}} E-30 was {{straight}} edged and of constant chord, with rounded wing tips and a large, rounded cut-out in the trailing edge above the fuselage to improve visibility from the rear cockpit. It was fabric covered over a wooden structure, with Spanish pine box spars and ribs. Its centre section contained an integral fuel tank and was mounted on the fuselage with three duraluminum cabane struts on each side to the fuselage <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides.</b> Each wing was braced {{with a pair of}} lift struts from the fuselage bottom to about mid-span.

25|$|The size, shape, material, decoration, and {{lettering}} {{style of}} jitsuin are closely regulated by law. For example, in Hiroshima, a jitsuin {{is expected to}} be roughly , usually square or (rarely) rectangular but never round, irregular, or oval, and must contain the individual's full family and given name, without abbreviation. The lettering must be red with a white background (shubun), with roughly equal width lines used throughout the name. The font must be one of several based on ancient historical lettering styles found in metal, woodcarving, and so on; ancient forms of ideographs are commonplace. A red perimeter must entirely surround the name, and there should be no other decoration on the underside (working surface) of the seal, though the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> (handle) of the seal may be decorated in any fashion from completely undecorated to historical animal motifs to dates, names, and inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was first}} {{observed}} in July 1966, {{there was still a}} large enemy force operating at the base and {{in the shadow of the}} Rockpile. The fight for the mountain occurred during Operation Hastings and involved 8,000 Marines and 3,000 South Vietnamese soldiers. The base at Dong Ha was used as a staging area to mount an attack on the DMZ and the area around the Rockpile. Brigadier General Lowell English, a commander in charge of Operation Hastings, stated that the Marines sought to take the North Vietnamese by surprise on their crucial infiltration routes and to smash and destroy their force in the DMZ region before they have a chance to regain balance or momentum. The actions started with bombing and napalm strikes on potential future landing zone sites in mid-July 1966. The initial helicopter assault of Operation Hastings was disastrous as two transport helicopters collided and crashed. By the end of the day 15 Marines were dead with a further 10 soldiers injured, however overall Operation Hastings was a success. By the operation's end on 3 August 1966 the United States had accounted for at least 824 confirmed NVA soldiers killed and 214 captured weapons compared to the 126 Marines killed and 448 wounded. The Rockpile officially came under the control of American troops by the end of July 1966 when a small observation team landed on top of the summit. The NVA immediately attempted to remove the Marines from their defensive position, but several attempts at scaling the Rockpile and striking the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> with mortar rounds proved ineffective. Operation Prairie swung the momentum for the mountain's fight after waves of Marines stormed into the area to reinforce the troops around the Rockpile and fortify its defenses. From then on the Rockpile was often manned by at least a squad of United States Marines, who received supply drops by helicopters and would go on to launch numerous operations from the base of the mountain.|$|E

500|$|The Leader had a [...] "dry lining" [...] firebox. It was not {{surrounded}} on <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> by a [...] "jacket" [...] {{of water}} as in normal practice, but was constructed of welded steel and used firebricks instead {{of water for}} insulation, a novel but troublesome solution. Using firebricks reduced the grate area from [...] to [...] and concentrated the fire in a smaller area. The firehole door was offset {{to the left of}} the boiler backhead, which created difficulties for the fireman when adding coal to the fire. The firebox was not initially equipped with a firebrick arch, although one was retro-fitted during the summer of 1950. The arch was problematic because it led to a tendency for flames to enter the cab at high outputs, a situation made worse by the narrowing of the firebox area.|$|E
500|$|Like all puffballs, Handkea utriformis has a gasteroid basidiocarp, {{meaning the}} spores are {{produced}} internally, and are only released as the mature fruiting body ages and dries, or is broken.Young puffballs are typically [...] across, white, or pale grey-brown; in maturity it may attain dimensions of [...] broad by [...] tall. The exoperidum is tomentosedesely {{covered with a}} layer of fine matted hairs. The species derives its common name [...] "mosiac puffball" [...] from the [...] pattern across the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> that develops as the fruiting body matures and the outer wall (exoperidium) breaks up into polygonal patches. The underside of the puffball is attached to the ground by a root-like assemblage of hyphae called [...] a rhizomorph. It is squat in appearance and roughly pear-shaped, not usually taller than it is wide. The flesh (gleba, or spore bearing mass) is white when young, but becomes brown and powdery upon maturity. The upper skin eventually disintegrates weeks or even months after the puffball's appearance, and the brown spores are released into the air; this process is often hastened by rain, or by being trodden on by cattle. Eventually, all that remains is the sterile cup-shaped base, which can sometimes hold water. This feature may have been the source of the specific epithet, as utrarius is Latin for ‘water carrier’.|$|E

Compared with Anodontosaurus it lacks small osteoderms at the bases of the large osteoderms on the first cervical half-ring, but, contrary to that genus, does in top view have large rounded osteoderms at the sides of the tail club. It differs from Dyoplosaurus in possessing sacral ribs that perpendicularly point outwards. It differs from Scolosaurus in possessing keeled osteoderms with a round or oval base on the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the first cervical half-ring and having a shorter rear blade of the ilium.

2500|$|Sand divers have an {{elongated}} body and can grow to {{a length of}} up to [...] The dorsal (upper) surface is dappled brownish-gray {{and there is a}} black patch on the shoulder girdle at {{the upper end of the}} gill slits. There are about eight pairs of reddish-brown bars on the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the body, broadest at the lateral line and narrowing towards the belly. There are also slender yellowish-gold longitudinal lines running along the body. The ventral (under) surface of the fish is pale. The tip of the lower jaw is rounded, without a fleshy knob, and the soft rays of the dorsal fin are relatively short, the tip of the front one lying on top of the origin of the hind one when depressed. These characteristics helps to distinguish this species from the offshore lizardfish (Synodus poeyi). The anal fin of the sand diver has ten to twelve soft rays which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar diamond lizardfish (Synodus synodus) which has eight to ten. Another fish with which it might be confused is the Atlantic lizardfish (Synodus saurus), but that species is uncommon in the Caribbean and has slender blue or turquoise longitudinal lines.|$|E
2500|$|He then {{consulted}} with a distillation expert, James A. Moffett, who was operating the Camden {{branch of the}} Standard Oil Company of Parkersburg, Moffett was convinced that dye manufacturing could be profitable and invested money in Bloede & Rathbone. [...] Dye manufacturing was organized as a separate entity named the American Aniline Works. [...] The founders of the new company had little dye making experience so they read German texts on the subject. There was no money left for new equipment, {{so they had to}} rely on scrapped equipment they obtained from the Standard Oil junk pile. [...] Instead of a heavy cast iron nitrator, an old boiler shell with a capacity of 1,000 gallons (3785 Litres) was fitted with a central shaft of horizontal wrought iron paddles. [...] The valve regulating the flow of acid into the nitrator was operated by a wire several hundred feet away. The operator would periodically run close enough to the nitrator to read the thermometer and run back to safety. [...] Cooling was accomplished by running cold spring water over the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the nitrator, keeping the reaction within a range of five degrees Fahrenheit. This procedure resulted in 7,000 to 8,000 pounds (3175 – 3628kg) of nitrobenzene per batch. In 1883 he established himself in Baltimore as a chemist and manufacturer of chemical products; and decided that there was a wide field for improvement in the methods then in use in chemical factories. Applying his skills he made tremendous advances in the chemistry business, mainly in the methods of dyeing cotton fabrics; and between 1890 and 1895 he obtained 15 or 20 patents for his chemical processes, {{one of the most important}} patents being his process for the dyeing [...] "sun-fast", unfading shades.|$|E
2500|$|Meigle 2 stands nearly [...] high. It has a {{cross on}} one side and depicts Daniel in the lions' den on the other. The form of the head of the cross is {{possibly}} based on that of a jewelled metal cross and is unique. The projecting boss at the centre of the cross has eight smaller bosses around it that probably symbolise the eight days of Passion Week running from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday inclusive. The shaft of the cross contains three pairs of sculpted animals facing each other, with interlaced tails and tongues, while other beasts fill the space between the cross and the outer border of the monument. The monument is the work of a master sculptor with the figures being cut in deep relief and arranged in an orderly fashion. Meigle 2 has projecting tenons on its <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> and was probably intended to slot into a screen or wall. Local folklore holds that the representation of Daniel in the lions' den depicts King Arthur's wife Guinevere, known locally as Vanora. She was abducted by King Mordred and condemned by Arthur to be torn apart by wild beasts. The monument was said to mark her grave. Meigle 2 was originally located {{on the east side of}} the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 1, and in front of a mound identified in local folklore as Vanora's Grave. Apart from the scene representing Daniel (or Vanora), the back of the monument also contains various other sections. These include a mounted huntsman with two hounds at the top, with an angel hovering above the dogs. Below this there is a procession of four horsemen, with three leading the fourth, who is distinguished by a large saddlecloth. The next row down is the Biblical Daniel scene, below this is a centaur holding an axe in each hand and branches trailing behind him. The lowest section depicts a beast grasping an ox, a club-wielding human figure is positioned behind the aggressor. The stone has lost some detail due to erosion, although this is concentrated at the lower part of the cross itself and suggests that some form of human activity regularly caused abrasion of that portion - the opposite side being less worn.|$|E
