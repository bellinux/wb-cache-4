5000|$|Railway sidings were {{established}} on the Main Southern Line {{at a point}} between Bargo and Yerrinbool. Transport to the dam site was again by light railway, on this occasion of standard gauge. This avoided <b>transhipment</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Government vehicles bringing materials from large commercial quarries, effectively making the line an extended privately owned siding. The line was 4 km long through gentle countryside. Trains were worked {{by a variety of}} locomotives, including a former Sydney Steam Tram Motor. Additionally, there was a system of narrow (...) gauge lines in use at the dam construction site.|$|R

40|$|A generic, {{quantitative}} {{risk assessment}} was carried out according to the standard method in the 'Purple Book' to determine the risks posed by pontoons used for supplying fuel to watercraft. The pontoon {{is assumed to be}} situated in a yacht basin accessible only to pleasure boats, and the tank lorry during unloading assumed to be protected against external impact <b>from</b> passing traffic. <b>The</b> reference system defined consists of a concrete pontoon with a relatively large capacity and a high volume of trade. Applying the reference pontoon system led to individual risk contours of 10 - 5 and 10 - 6 per year, which almost coincide. The distance of these risk contours to both the pontoon and the tank lorry is about 20 metres. The risk posed by the pontoon is largely determined by the pool fire within the pontoon and a rupture in the loading hose, which could take place during <b>transhipment</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tank lorry to the pontoon...|$|R
