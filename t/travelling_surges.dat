The {{variations of the}} luminosity of two parallel auroral arcs, plasma depletion on the poleward edge {{of one of these}} arcs as well as electron and ion temperatures in front of a westward <b>travelling</b> <b>surge</b> were studied. It was found that a shortlived brightening of a weak zenith arc before an auroral breakup was accompanied by fading of an equatorial arc and, vice versa. A plasma depletion in the E region was detected by the EISCAT radar on the poleward edge of the zenith arc just before the auroral breakup. The plasma depletion was associated with an enhancement of ion (at the altitudes of 150 — 200 km) and electron (in E region) temperatures. During its occurrence, the electric field in the E-region was extremely large (� 150 mV/m). A significant increase in ion temperature was also observed 1 min before the arrival of a westward <b>travelling</b> <b>surge</b> (WTS) at the radar zenith. This was interpreted as the existence of an extended area of enhanced electric field ahead of the WTS. ...|$|R

From the combination of solar wind parameter observations by ACE and magnetic field observations by the low altitude satellite CHAMP, the location of auroral breakups in response to solar illumination and solar coupling parameters are studied. Furthermore, the correspondence of the onset location with prominent large-scale field-aligned currents and electrojets are investigated. Solar illumination and the related ionospheric conductivity have significant effects on the most probable substorm onset latitude and local time. In sunlight, substorm onsets tend to occur 1 h earlier in local time and 1. 5 ° more poleward than in darkness. The solar wind input, represented by the merging electric field, integrated over 1 h prior to the substorm, correlates well with the latitude of the breakup.

These include an intensifying electrojet, westward <b>travelling</b> <b>surge</b> (WTS) and ?-band. We use data based, realistic models for these phenomena and calculate the inductive electric fields that are created due to the temporal variations of ionospheric currents. The ionospheric induction problem is solved using a new calculation technique that can handle non-uniform, time-dependent conductances and electric fields of any geometry. We find that in some situations inductive effects are not negligible and the ionospheric electric field is not a pure potential field, but has a significant induced rotational part. In the WTS and ?-band models the induced electric field is concentrated in a small area, where the time derivatives are largest. In the electrojet model the induced field is significant over {{a large part of}} the jet area. In these examples the induced electric field has typical values of few mV/m, which amounts to several tens of percents of the potential electric field present at the same locations. The induced electric field is associated with ionospheric and field aligned currents (FAC), that modify the overall structure of the current systems. Especially the induced FAC are often comparable to the non-inductive FAC, and may thus modify the coupling between the ionosphere and magnetosphere in the most dynamical situations. We also present some examples with very simple ionospheric current systems, where the effect of different ionospheric parameters on the induction process is studied...|$|R

Three types of structured velocity regime are apparent depending {{on the level of}} magnetic activity and the position of the radar viewing area relative to the substorm enhanced currents and the Pi 2 pulsation generation region.

We reveal a previously unobserved mode that falls 1 to 2 hours prior to high water, although this cluster is not associated with the highest residuals.

The phase shift of the tidal signal is combined with the modulation of surge production due to water depth in a model that provides a good description of the residual data set.

Besides the magnetic field measurements, there were auroral observations and plasma flow and conductivity measurements obtained by EISCAT. The data of all three sets of instruments are consistent with the notion of upward field-aligned currents associated with the moving auroral patches. A detailed analysis of the electrodynamic parameters in the ionosphere, however, reveals that they do not agree with the expectations resulting from commonly used simplifying approximations. For example, the westward moving auroral streamers which are associated with field-aligned current filaments, are not collocated with the centres of equivalent current vortices. Furthermore, there is a clear discrepancy between the measured plasma flow direction and the obtained equivalent current direction. All this suggests that steep conductivity gradients are associated with the transient auroral forms. Also self-induction effects in the ionosphere may play a role for the orientation of the plasma flows. This study stresses the importance of multi-instrument observation for a reliable interpretation of dynamic auroral processes. Keywords.

The signatures observed on the two measuring systems are compared and have been interpreted in terms of the substorm current wedge and the substorm enhanced electrojet regions. The polarisation of the SABRE Pi 2 pulsations is also investigated. The excellent spatial resolution of the SABRE radar has enabled the complex system of field-aligned and ionospheric currents associated with substorm onset and Pi 2 pulsations to be examined in great detail. A southward turning of the flow often observed at substorm onset {{may be related to the}} earthward surge of plasma at onset. The subsequent westward movement of these regions may be related to the westward <b>travelling</b> <b>surge.</b> This movement, and a less frequent eastward movement, is also observed in studies of the SABRE wave spectral power. Four intervals of Pi 2 activity have been selected for detailed study and the observed features related to different theoretical and observational models for the generation of these waves.

The results are consistent with a field line resonance in one interval and the interaction of a pair of field-aligned currents in another. The highly complex structure of the substorm current systems in the magnetotail is apparent in the ionospheric radar data from the remaining two intervals. The high spatial resolution attained in the present observations far exceeds that achieved with other techniques.
