25|$|From the carpark {{at the end}} of Glenesk Road, {{directions}} {{are clearly}} signposted. A well formed loop track, used by around 30,000 people a year (2005), follows the Glen Esk Stream with minor undulations (on the south side) up to a lookout where you find a huge Macrocarpa bench seat to rest on and admire the view. The bench seat was made by offenders doing community work (2005). The track then descends down wooden steps {{to the base of the}} falls (40 minutes from the carpark). The track then crosses the stream next to the lower swimming hole and returns down the north side. However, instead of going down again, a walker can climb a reasonably steep track (the Connect Track) which begins about 100m from the base of the falls on the northern side of the stream. It takes about 15 minutes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the falls. There is a good swimming hole at the top although the water is cool. From this high vantage point there are great views down the valley.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Willich wheeled to {{the north}} and began {{crushing}} the flank of Anderson's division. Willich's success assisted Beatty's brigade <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> The two brigades first drove off Brig. Gen. Arthur M. Manigault's men and continued rolling north. As they came up the ridge, the Union brigades of Turchin, Van Derveer, and Phelps (who was killed near the crest) added their weight to the assault against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. Zachariah C. Deas, Alfred J. Vaughan, and John K. Jackson. Some Confederate soldiers resisted stubbornly, but many panicked and ran when they realized that Union troops were bearing down on them from the flank. Often, the Southern infantry fled before the supporting artillerists could escape with their cannons. In this manner, Anderson's entire division and Cheatham's left flank brigades of Brig. Gens. Jackson and Moore were routed. The northward Federal advance was only stopped by the stout fighting of Walthall's brigade and nightfall. Cheatham, Gist, Stevenson, and Cleburne were able to get their divisions away more or less intact, although the Confederate soldiers were demoralized and chagrined by their defeat.|$|E

The Chilkoot Pass was higher than the White Pass, but more used it: around 22,000 during the gold rush. The trail passed up through camps until it reached a flat ledge, just before the main ascent, which was too steep for animals. This location was known as the Scales, and was where goods were weighed before travellers officially entered Canada. The cold, the steepness and the weight of equipment made the climb extremely arduous and it could take a day <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the [...] high slope.|$|E

During Kennedy's NHL years, newspapers often used the spelling [...] "Teeter". Kennedy was captain of the midget Port Colborne Lions when they won the O.M.H.A. Championship in 1941. The Toronto Star described the 15-year-old Kennedy as a [...] "shifty rightwinger" [...] who had [...] "paced the Lions to victory, scoring five goals, two of which were solo efforts." [...] On May 7, 1941, at a banquet in Port Colborne honouring the championship team, one of the speakers was Hap Day, coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He spoke to the players, advising them that [...] "keen desire" [...] and [...] "hard work" [...] was required <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> in hockey as in any job in life and that hockey salaries were [...] "equal to other leading professions". Day then presented members of the team with jackets bearing the championship crest. In only two years, Kennedy was playing for Hap Day's Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E

500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top...</b> I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E

2500|$|Affectionately nicknamed [...] "Go" [...] and towering at {{a whopping}} five-foot [...] "ape", the Gorilla is the Phoenix Suns {{favorite}} primate. Most notably, fans {{are familiar with}} the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball. Before his debut with the Phoenix Suns, the Gorilla delivered singing telegrams. However, in 1980 the Gorilla's fate changed when he stepped onto the court during a game and surprised unsuspecting players and fans. His antics became an instant hit and the Gorilla {{has been a member of}} the Phoenix Suns ever since. Since then, the gorilla, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter. The Gorilla would do a few push-ups on the court, then head off in a quest to climb the stairs of both the lower and upper level of the Coliseum <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> When he reached the base of the upper level, he’d stop for a second to soak up the applause, then head to the top of the building. When he got there, the crowd would explode. It never failed. Also, one of his more beloved skits was at a Knicks home game where he came out to Frank Sinatra's Theme from New York, wearing a hat, with several pieces of garbage stuck to his leg. Halfway through the song, a group of [...] "muggers" [...] attacked him, and he staggered off the court afterwards. Give him credit, The Gorilla has always been more than a slapstick comedian. In a way, though, that's what makes The Gorilla so much fun. He's not really there just to cheer on the Suns – although he does so with great enthusiasm. The Gorilla just wants to have fun, and wants the rest of us to have fun with him.|$|E
