25|$|In 1914, a {{group of}} predominately 300 white Pentecostal ministers and laymen from all regions of the United States {{gathered}} in Hot Springs, Arkansas, to create a new, national Pentecostal fellowship—the General Council of the Assemblies of God. By 1911, many of <b>these</b> <b>white</b> ministers were distancing themselves from an existing arrangement under an African-American leader. Many of <b>these</b> <b>white</b> ministers were licensed by the African-American, C. H. Mason {{under the auspices of}} the Church of God in Christ, one of the few legally chartered Pentecostal organizations at the time credentialing and licensing ordained Pentecostal clergy. To further such distance, Bishop Mason and other African-American Pentecostal leaders were not invited to the initial 1914 fellowship of Pentecostal ministers. These predominately white ministers adopted a congregational polity (whereas the COGIC and other Southern groups remained largely episcopal) and rejected a Finished Work understanding of Sanctification. Thus, the creation of the Assemblies of God marked an official end of Pentecostal doctrinal unity and racial integration.|$|E
25|$|Leukemia, also spelled leukaemia, is a {{group of}} cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of {{abnormal}} white blood cells. <b>These</b> <b>white</b> blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells.

These figures alarmed both Asian and white communities, and led to the British National Party announcing it would stand in the forthcoming general election, with its leader Nick Griffin to stand as a candidate for election for the constituency of Oldham West and Royton. The far-right National Front political party also announced its interest in the town and intent to provide its own candidates for election too.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the extreme}} rarity of the white tiger allele in the wild, the {{breeding}} pool {{was limited to the}} small number of white tigers in captivity. According to Kailash Sankhala, the last white tiger ever seen in the wild was shot in 1958. Today there is a large number of white tigers in captivity. A white Amur tiger may have been born at Center Hill and has given rise to a strain of white Amur tigers. A man named Robert Baudy realized that his tigers had white genes when a tiger he sold to Marwell Zoo in England developed white spots, and bred them accordingly. The Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa Bay has four of <b>these</b> <b>white</b> Amur tigers, descended from Robert Baudy's stock.|$|E

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of <b>these</b> <b>white</b> garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, {{chief of}} Clan Campbell, bred a breed of white Scottish terriers {{known as the}} [...] "Roseneath Terrier".

The dog seemed to produce <b>these</b> <b>white</b> puppies regardless of the sire to which she was bred, and after drowning over 20 of these offspring, he came upon the theory {{that it was an}} ancient trait of the Scottish Terrier that was trying to reappear. He rededicated his breeding program to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the same stature as the dark-coloured breed.

2500|$|The {{war and the}} {{campaign}} had ruined {{what remained of the}} planter class fortunes and a number of families both rich and poor had been wiped out. The battles had destroyed or heavily damaged much of the countryside's physical infrastructure and homes. The black slave population had declined heavily through escape during the war and the subsequent emancipation of slaves. The devastation of the plantation economy also wreaked havoc on the small white communities in the countryside. Most of <b>these</b> <b>white</b> laborers, as plantation work overseers, skilled workers and servants, or as county law enforcement and civil servants such as Patrol constables, and Road agents, gained important cash from supporting the plantations and government. [...] Consequently, {{with the end of the}} antebellum economy and Reconstruction, aside from suffering losses to its male population in the war, <b>these</b> <b>white</b> families now faced an unemployable economy. [...] As a result, along with much of what remained of the slave population they turned to sharecropping and became notoriously impoverished. Others turned to the small town or slowly drifted elsewhere across the country. The Hundreds never again recovered its early population level into the 21st century.|$|E
2500|$|A Royal North-West Mounted Police {{investigation}} {{began after}} word reached Fort Norman that Inuit {{had been seen}} wearing the priests' clothing, {{and the two men}} surrendered themselves without incident in May 1916. Part of Uloqsaq's police statement read, [...] "I wanted to speak; Ilogoak [...] put his hand over my mouth... Ilogoak pointed the gun at us. I was afraid and I was crying... Sinnisiak said to me 'We ought to kill <b>these</b> <b>white</b> men before they kill us.'" [...] Partly due to a previous incident with similar circumstances following which no action was taken, the authorities wished to make an example out of the two Inuit men, and Sinnisiak was tried in Edmonton for the murder of Rouvière, largely because it was thought that Sinnisiak had been the 'ringleader'. He was found not guilty because the jury thought that the Inuit man had cause to kill the priest.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{at least}} one genetically-controlled type of white {{patterning}} that is strictly associated with the leopard complex. <b>These</b> <b>white</b> patterns permit the spots associated with the leopard complex to become visible. Other white patterns, such as tobiano or white leg markings, obscure leopard spots. A certain amount of leopard-associated white patterning may be present at birth. Temporal changes in the amount of white patterning are discussed below. Leopard-associated white patterning is usually symmetrical and originates over the hips. A proposed gene, PATN-1, may be responsible for the most familiar expressions of white: heterozygotes possessing common-size [...] "blankets" [...] and homozygotes possessing extensive [...] "blankets" [...] that may affect the entire coat. Even horses with extensive white usually retain dark colored regions just above the hooves, on the knees and hocks, stifles and elbows, hips and points of shoulder, the tail, mane, and the bony parts of the face. The smallest amount of white patterning is just a sprinkling of white over the hips.|$|E
60|$|By {{this system}} some two {{thousand}} white agents were {{scattered over the}} Free State to collect the produce. <b>These</b> <b>whites</b> were placed in ones and twos in the more central points, and each was given a tract of country containing {{a certain number of}} villages. By the help of the inmates he was to gather the rubber, which was the most valuable asset. <b>These</b> <b>whites,</b> many of whom were men of low morale before they left Europe, were wretchedly paid, the scale running from 150 to 300 francs a month. This pay they might supplement by a commission or bonus on the amount of rubber collected. If their returns were large it meant increased pay, official praise, a more speedy return to Europe, and a better chance of promotion. If, on the other hand, the returns were small, it meant poverty, harsh reproof and degradation. No system could be devised by which a body of men could be so driven to attain results at any cost. It is not to the absolute discredit of Belgians that such an existence should have demoralized them, and, indeed, there were other nationalities besides Belgians in the ranks of the agents. I doubt if Englishmen, Americans, or Germans could have escaped the same result had they been exposed in a tropical country to similar temptations.|$|R
