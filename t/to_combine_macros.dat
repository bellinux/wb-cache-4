30|$|All these {{problems}} can be solved by providing a hierarchy of clocks in the synchronous system that does not only allow <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> <b>macro</b> steps <b>to</b> a larger step of a slower clock, but that also allows one to refine the base clock into different faster clocks. Thereby, {{it is possible to}} explicitly describe the point of time, when synchronization should happen, independent of the number of steps that have been passed or that are needed for a calculation. The refinement of the base clock in a module is particularly attractive since it retains the external input/output behavior. Thereby, it is possible to replace a code segment by another one having a different temporal behavior. For instance, it becomes possible to exchange components with functionally equivalent ones running at higher clock speeds. Obviously, refinements make component-based design much more flexible.|$|R
40|$|This study {{addressing}} the Derek Layer’s theory of social domains and the dualism between structure and action in social theory, aims {{to display the}} distinction between micro and macro analysis in sociology, emphasized frequently. Arguments on the crisis of sociology because of its problematic nature have brought the questions on how the social reality should be understood. Therefore, the claim that social reality should be understood by analyzing the structure is confronted by the claim that social reality can be understood with {{a reference to the}} individual. Thus both discourses having a single channel to understand and to explain society produce onesided explanation of social reality. Undoubtedly, theories aiming <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> <b>macro</b> and micro have gained significance against these discourses. In this study based on Layder’s theory of social domains, efforts for building bridges between notions of “structure” and “action” in social theory are evaluated, and basic ideas and shortcomings of the “theory of social domains” are discusse...|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{social policy}} has an {{important}} role in dealing with social problems of citizens. On micro level, municipalities spend a substantial amount of their budget solving such problems. However, increasing the amount of money spent on solving problems of each individual at micro level does not provide efficient fulfilment of the tasks defined for municipal social policy making. Thus new, complementary solutions should be looked into, as new ways of development of social work in municipalities should be designed with the aim to increase the level of citizen participation and joint responsibility, especially of socially vulnerable groups. Research results let the author conclude that social activity of socially vulnerable groups should be promoted by creating a series of prerequisites, among which citizen participation, need for organisational support, activities that would foster politician and municipality officials’ attitude towards citizen participation and their social capital increase, two-way relationship between citizens and officials, and the worker that would promote citizen participation, among which is social policy making, are considered to be very important. All of this can be successfully reached by developing community work in local municipalities. This is the missing link <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> <b>macro</b> and micro levels, or political determination and practical implementation of citizen participation...|$|R

The results from this case study indicate that graduates are attracted to urban settings not only for the labour market, but also for the living environment and social ties. The results also highlight the fact that migration decisions cannot be reduced to a single dimension. They are complex (in the sense that motives of several natures are involved in combination) and diverse (as differences are found within even a seemingly homogeneous population group). Although work is a central factor motivating the out-migration of graduates, the importance of social ties and residential amenities is also clear...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{topic of}} this paper {{concerns}} void defects. We introduce a model to describe the macroscopic resin flow considering the compression of residual air in the preform. A microscopic flow model is also developed {{to account for the}} microvoid formation due to the variation of resin velocity at the flow front. According to these mathematical models, a numerical simulation code was developed <b>to</b> perform a <b>combined</b> <b>macro</b> and micro flow analysis with the saturation of the medium. The results of these simulations are compared with experimental results obtained by the laboratory device. We present the real-time measurement of the void content evolutions during the injection, using an original sensor. Our technique is based on the electrical conductivity of the injected liquid. After the material and method presentation, some results obtained during injection are shown. The developed analysis technique and the numerical simulation code can be used for obtaining the optimal processing conditions and design parameters in manufacturing of composites by Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) processes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a 3 D DEM program TRUBAL, {{which is}} capable of calculating the contact between {{particles}} considering friction and local plastic deformation, is employed to study the evolution of internal structure of particle assemblies during the consolidation process. Uniaxial powder compaction process is simulated in a cubic periodic unit cell by applying the strain rate to the individual particles. The selection of the proper time steps in DEM for quasi-static case is discussed. Results in particle scale (microscopic) are obtained and correlated to the statistical bulk response of the assembly. The effects of the microscopic properties of particles (such as friction, plastic contact) on the bulk mechanical response are examined by numerical tests. Correlations between the microscopic properties of particles and the macroscopic continuum behaviours of compacts are discussed. These discussions {{make it possible to}} fit DEM results at a macroscopic scale to the experimental measurements by adjusting the particle properties in DEM calculation. An example test is carried out to demonstrate that DEM results could be fitted properly to the experimental results, in the mean time, also provide some microscopic results which are hard to be measured.

The analysis forms a pilot study for part of an EC dairy sector model. The par-ticular demand and supply functions are derived from theory.

This particular working method enables information from cross-section (or time series cross-section) data <b>to</b> be <b>combined</b> with <b>macro</b> data, leading to a consistent result on aggregate level. On the supply side, two concepts are used: a dynamic price reaction and a total price. The very specific lagged price reaction of dairy farmers is investigated, assuming that they attune their production to a total price, which is derived from the prices of milk, beef, calves and concentrates. Many hypotheses about the supply function have been tested empirically. The very popular Nerlove scheme should be rejected for the supply function of milk in the Netherlands.

40|$|Greece {{has been}} in ‘crisis’ for six {{consecutive}} years now and during this time living standards have dropped considerably {{for the majority of}} the population, strict austerity measures have been implemented and unemployment has reached a record figure of 27. 8 % (with a Eurozone average of 12 %). At the same time, a ‘success story’ is prominent in dominant discourses where Greece is portrayed to have achieved a primary budget surplus and according to which the ‘worst has passed’. The dire consequences of austerity, the political polarisation of Greek society and the rise of the far-right party Golden Dawn (GD), however, indicate a much less positive picture. In this context, the article aims to problematise the complex nexus of relationships between the financial crisis and the re-emergence of the extreme right-wing party, GD. The discussion draws on an analysis of 1497 postings from the online website of the British newspaper, The Guardian. We focus on discourse strategies for attributing/resisting blame emerging from the analysis of the postings, but also as negotiated in two popular threads on the online discussion board. The article takes a critical stance and combines the discourse-historical approach with a micro analysis of the interaction. This allows us to pay special attention to the multiple layers of context and <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> the <b>macro</b> and the micro in the constructions of blame and sense making of the crisis. Analysis of the data shows that a range of actors is held responsible for the current situation, while the rise of GD is constructed both as a ‘product of’ and ‘movement against’ the crisis.

However, high elasticities of income flows also suggest that increases in withholding rates at the individual treaty partner level would not necessarily result in more revenue collection.
