40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{proposed}} to find methods of structural reinforcement of a side frame of a bogie {{in areas of}} stress concentration (the compound zone, {{the corners of the}} pedestal jaw opening, etc.), where, as the experience of operation shows, it is possible the emergence of fatigue cracks. It should avoid a significant increase in weight of the structure and does not cause «overflow» areas with a lot of stress from one portion of the structure to another. Methodology. The stresses in the side frame are determined by finite element modeling. Firstly parts of structure that is subject to be strengthened are detected. At the next stage the possible ways of enhancement are developed (wall thickness increase, change of fillet radii, introduction of additional <b>truss</b> <b>plate,</b> etc.). After which according to the results of simulation the effectiveness of each method is evaluated. Amplification of individual sections of the side frame does not always lead to its hardening as a whole (stress decrease in one place often leads to stress increase in the other one). The further procedure is iterative in nature: best-case changes are entered {{in the design of the}} frame; weakened areas of construction again are revealed and so on, till to the achievement an acceptable level of safety. Findings. Directional iterative search allows finding a combination of local amplification that increasing significantly the strength of structure. Namely, radius of the transition from the column to the support surface and in the openings between the column and the inclined belt up to 40 and 50 mm are increased respectively; <b>truss</b> <b>plate</b> are added between the upper and lower shelf of Triangel guide and on the inner guide of jaw aperture; technological area of the aperture in the column is reduced by one-third. Due to the proposed stresses combination, voltages in construction were reduced by 41 %. Originality. The efficiency of the iterative search procedure of local amplifications combinations in design of the side frame that let significantly increase its strength without a significant increase in weight is presented by scientists.

40|$|Presented: 2006 - 06 - 16 Graduation date: 2007 Heavy timber framing relies {{primarily}} on bracing to withstand lateral loads due to earthquakes and wind events. Bracing configurations in heavy timber framed buildings vary widely and include cross bracing, knee bracing, and other geometries. Many heavy timber frames constructed during colonial American times are still standing, exceeding the expected life of many structures being built today. Limited {{research has been}} conducted on the lateral resistance of heavy timber frames and their connections and design aids and procedures are not readily available for engineers to assist in the design of these structures. This method of wood construction has been largely replaced with the development of light-framed wood buildings, which utilize sheathing (typically plywood or OSB) attached to the frame to resist lateral loads. Today, the primary form of wood construction is light-frame. These structures rely on shearwalls to resist lateral loads. The shearwall consists of 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 studs regularly spaced with wood structural panel sheathing attached to the wall frame. This assembly is lightweight and ductile. Extensive {{research has been conducted}} on light-frame shearwalls since the 1950 ’s. The effects of construction variables (i. e., fastener schedule, sheathing thickness and grade, anchorage, and openings) on shearwall performance have been cataloged through numerous studies. Studies have found the sheathing-frame connection, particularly the perimeter connection, is critical to the performance of a shearwall. This connection is typically nailed, although sometimes staples or adhesives are used. The lateral load path in light-frame shearwalls relies on the sheathing-framing connection. If the load path can be modified then shearwall design can more fully utilize compressive and tensile properties of the wood materials and be less sensitive to the sheathing-framing connection properties. The idea of combining bracing typical of heavy timber framing with techniques used in light-frame construction has not been widely explored by research or analysis. This study investigates the use of bracing in conjunction with light-frame construction (a hybrid framing) to relieve the sheathing nails as the critical load path and enhance the shearwall performance under lateral loading. A 4 by 8 -ft. shearwall was designed consisting of an internal cross brace without intermediate framing studs and a lapped connection at the cross intersection. A 4 x 4 top-plate was used to improve vertical capacity of the braced shearwall because no intermediate stud was included. Four different types of shearwalls were tested under cyclic loading following the CUREE protocol; a conventional light-framed shearwall, a cross-braced shearwall with no mechanical connection at the corners of the walls, a cross-braced shearwall with plywood gusset plates at the corners of the walls, and a cross-braced shearwall with metal <b>truss</b> <b>plates</b> at the corners of the walls. The conventional shearwall and the braced shearwall without mechanical connections {{at the corner of the}} wall performed similarly - the sheathing-frame connections controlled their performance. Withdrawal of the sheathing nails was the dominate failure mode. The braced shearwalls with the plywood gusset plate and the metal <b>truss</b> <b>plates</b> at the corners exhibited greater ultimate loads, greater initial stiffness and dissipated more energy compared to the conventional shearwall. The modes of failure for these walls were shear failures in the plywood gusset plates and buckling in the metal <b>truss</b> <b>plates.</b> Some failure was observed in the sheathing nails, however, to a lesser degree than observed in the conventional shearwall. The load path of vertical forces must be addressed in areas where intermediate studs are excluded due to the bracing configuration. Four additional walls were tested under vertical loading; two conventional shearwalls and two cross-braced shearwalls with metal <b>truss</b> <b>plates</b> at the corners. The braced shearwalls proved to adequately resist service level vertical loads similar to those resisted by the conventional shearwall. Overall, using a hybridized shearwall as a part of light-frame construction appears to be viable option to enhance the lateral performance...|$|R

The results indicate relatively low stresses in top and bottom chord members during lifting. Slenderness ratios are exceeded under current lifting guidelines.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to use a three-dimensional (3 D) analysis method to evaluate "system effects " in light-frame roof truss assemblies. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop an improved and practical design method for 3 D roof truss assemblies used in residential construction. A <b>truss</b> <b>plate</b> manufacturer (TPM) design software was used to layout assemblies and to design individual trusses. The TPM software used a conventional design procedure (CDP) by analyzing one truss at a time in two dimensions. A commer cially available structural analysis program was utilized to model and analyze 3 D truss assemblies as a system. This system design procedure (SDP) is being proposed as a tool to analyze and design 3 D roof truss assemblies. Three truss assemblies, L shape, T shape, and a complex assembly, were analyzed. The structural responses including combined stress index (CSn, truss deflections, and reactions from both CDP and SDP were compared and the system effects were evaluated. From this investigation, it is concluded that there are three system effects observed by the SDP, but not accounted for by CDP. These are: reduced applied load effect, truss-to-truss support effect, and stiff truss effect. Based on this investigation, the maximum CSI for most trusses in all three assemblies reduced by 6 - 60 % because of system effects.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The growing use of light-frame wood trusses in the {{residential}} and commercial construction has generated the need for general analysis procedures for predicting deformations and ultimate load of truss-plate joints, which are the basis for accurate evaluation of structural performance and design of complete truss assemblies. This dissertation was aimed at developing such a model. The developed model incorporates mechanisms of load transfer from one wood member through the <b>truss</b> <b>plate</b> and into another wood member and predicts the load-deflection trace and ultimate load. It treats plate teeth as beams on elastic foundation and applies Runge-Kutta numerical analysis to solve the governing differential equations. The nonlinear response of the foundation is accounted for by a linear step-by-step procedure. Additional theoretical investigation consisted of using an existing program to perform finite element analysis of plate joints to determine the interaction of plate teeth arranged in columns or in rows. This analysis showed some interaction among teeth in columns and none among teeth in rows. To develop data for model verification, tests were performed on joints made of Douglas-fir lumber and 20 -gauge truss plates with die-punched teeth -for various grain and plate orientations. Foundation moduli of test joints were obtained by embedment testing under compression loads. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental load-deflection traces show acceptable agreement. Ultimate load was accurately predicted for specimens which failed {{as a result of}} tooth withdrawal, but not for either plate failure or wood failure perpendicular-to-grain, neither of which was included in the model. Possible future model improvements should consist of incorporating these two failure modes and a mechanism associated with moment transfer through plate joints...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This study {{presents}} a practical method to model an actual Metal-Plate- Connected (MPC) roof truss assembly using a commercial program, SAP 2000, to investigate its system performance. Truss assembly modeling was examined because the conventional single truss design method ignores system effects, such as variability of {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE), interaction of sub-assemblies, realistic boundary conditions, etc. Two types of semi-rigid MPC joint models, linear spring (LS) joint model and a <b>truss</b> <b>plate</b> manufacturer's (TPM's) joint model, {{were used for the}} truss and truss assembly models. To verify the truss models using the LS joint model, the predicted deflections of individual trusses and the load sharing of nine-truss roof assembly models were compared with experimental results from the literature. Fourteen individual trusses (the components of the actual roof truss assembly) using TPM's joint models were also verified by comparing the Combined Stress Index (CSI) values with the CSI values provided by the TPM. Both design and one set of random material properties were used in the analysis of the actual roof truss assembly model. The predictions for truss models using the LS joint model for truss deflections and load sharing effect agree with the experimental results. The CSI values for individual trusses with the TPM's joint model matched the CSI values provided by the TPM. The load distribution in an actual roof truss assembly is strongly influenced by the interaction of sub-assemblies and by the boundary conditions. In the truss assembly, the prediction of location and value of maximum CSI are different from those for the single truss. The truss with the maximum CSI value of 0. 91 among fourteen individual truss types decreased to 0. 52 and 0. 51 when this truss is in the assembly with design and random material properties, respectively. Moreover, the truss with a maximum CSI of 1. 03 in the assembly (with design properties) had a CSI value of only 0. 95 as an individual truss.

40|$|Typical {{elements}} in structural engineering (beams, <b>trusses,</b> <b>plates</b> and shells) can be investigatedby means of quite simple material models employing {{a small number}} of material properties,especially as wooden structures are loaded within the elastic domain only and plasticity is nottaken into account. When investigating details, e. g. connections, three-dimensional stress andstrain distributions occur. At areas with local stress concentrations, elastic limit states maybe reached at low global load levels, but local plasticity need not endanger the stability of theentire structure. This study investigates dowel-type steel-to-timber connections. In particular, the behavior ofwood under high pressure loads and when yielding as well as the influences of contact and frictionbetween dowel and wood and of the nonlinearity of steel when yielding on the load carryingcapacity of the connection are analysed.

Two 198 ft through-trusses with eight panels on each side and one 120 ft through-truss with six panels on each side form {{the body of the}} bridge. The arc of the truss consists of steel beams connected to one another by [...] "batten plates" [...] (single-piece, flat, cast steel plates). The chords (the vertical and sloping beams) fit within a flange (a U-shaped, single-piece, cast steel plate) which is battened to the arc of the truss. The portal braces (the criss-crossing small beams that form a box hanging from the [...] "roof" [...] of the truss) are fastened to the <b>truss</b> with gusset <b>plates.</b> The horizontal struts at the top of each portal brace is made of [...] "laced" [...] steel (beams with holes in it), since the struts are in tension (being pulled apart) rather than compression (crushed from the ends). This allows them to be lighter and save weight. The sway braces (criss-crossing beams perpendicular to the portal braces) are attached to the <b>truss</b> with gusset <b>plates,</b> and bolted to one another at midpoint. In the deck, the 19 long floor I-beams are held together by five [...] "stringer" [...] I-beams. The deck itself is a single concrete slab, cast in place.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the numerical simulation of the bending resistance of CSTCB in stage 1 (element made {{only by the}} self-supported steel <b>truss</b> and base <b>plate).</b> Two different base plates were considered (Steel and Concrete) and {{two different types of}} steel trusses (Type I and II). The numerical results are also compared with analytical results, assuming the full interaction between steel truss and concrete, neglecting the tensile strength of concrete, considering the effective area of concrete stressed up to the compressive resistance. The design followed the general rules for steel and concrete structures...|$|R
