5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E

5|$|Oliver North and John Poindexter {{were indicted}} on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, {{was found guilty}} by a jury of three felony counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> Scandal.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. <b>The</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> Affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E

50|$|By 1982 Contra {{forces had}} begun {{carrying}} out assassinations {{of members of}} the Nicaraguan government and by 1983 the Contras had launched a major offensive and the CIA was helping them to plant mines in Nicaragua's harbors to prevent foreign weapons shipments from arriving. <b>The</b> 1987 <b>Iran-Contra</b> affair placed <b>the</b> Reagan Administration again at the center of secret support for the Contras.|$|R

[...] Whittlesey has repeatedly and emphatically denied this charge, for which she maintains no proof was produced, as a politically motivated attempt by a Democrat-dominated House to discredit her White House Outreach Group initiative, which had been [...] "a legitimate and in every respect legal attempt to communicate Reagan's anti-communist policy in Central America." [...] Of her association with Oliver North, she asserted, [...] "We worked closely together. That's why I was investigated. That's why I was hauled before a congressional panel and investigated. They were criminalizing policy differences." ...|$|R

[...] An early Eddies commercial parody appeared on NBC's Saturday Night Live on January 22, 1977 in the Dan Aykroyd creation, [...] "Crazy Ernie." [...] Carroll and the commercials became significantly cultural during the 1980s, with the commercials sometimes appearing {{in the background of}} contemporary motion pictures.

25|$|Along with {{bombings and}} hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made {{extensive}} use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is decapitation, another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the Lebanese Civil War resulted in <b>the</b> 1986 <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair. During <b>the</b> chaos of the Iraq War, more than 200 kidnappings foreign hostages (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the kidnapping of Alan Johnston by Army of Islam resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.|$|R
