5|$|While the UN was {{reluctant}} to engage with the F-FDTL, several bilateral donors have assisted the force's development. Australia has provided extensive training and logistical support to the F-FDTL since it was established, and currently provides advisors who are posted to the F-FDTL and Ministry of Defence and Security. Portugal also provides advisors and trains two naval officers each year in Portugal. China provided US$1.8million in aid to the F-FDTL between 2002 and 2008 and agreed {{to build a new}} US$7million headquarters for the force in late 2007. East Timor is one of Brazil's main destinations for aid and the Brazilian Army is responsible for training the F-FDTL's military police unit (Maubere Mission). The United States also provides a small amount of assistance to the F-FDTL through the State Department's International Military Education and Training Program. While Malaysia has provided training courses and financial and <b>technical</b> <b>aid,</b> this assistance was suspended after the 2006 crisis. Under current arrangements Portugal provides the F-FDTL with basic and advanced training while Australia and other nations provide training in specialised skills. As of 2013 the East Timorese government had posted a single member of the F-FDTL to serve overseas as an observer with the United Nations Mission in Liberia. In 2015 the government was considering joining Australia's Pacific Patrol Boat Program.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on <b>technical</b> <b>aid</b> between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{research}} has highlighted disability as a determinant {{of the need}} for technical aids; surprisingly, disease as a potential determinant has been ignored. The goal {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the possession of <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> is dependent on the type of chronic disease, illness duration, co-morbidity, disability, age, and several other factors. Methods: the study was performed in a representative sample of persons with a somatic chronic disease (n= 2262). Type of chronic disease, time post-diagnosis and co-morbidity were assessed by the patient's general practitioner. Disability was assessed with the Sickness Impact Profile. The possession of <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> and other characteristics were assessed by questionnaire. Results: Type of chronic disease (ostheoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and COPD), disability, age and gender were significantly and independently associated with the possession of <b>technical</b> <b>aids.</b> Conclusions: Apart from disability, disease-, age-, and gender-related characteristics determine the possession of <b>technical</b> <b>aids.</b> A detailed assessment of these characteristics is required in order to ensure that <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> meet personal needs.

40|$|Abstract. Rehabilitation <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> have an {{important}} role in the functional rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy. But now the rehabilitation <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> for cerebral palsy is lack of pertinence and evaluation. The testing equipment of rehabilitation <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> for cerebral palsy child can detect the pressure distribution between cerebral palsy patients and rehabilitation props in real time, and provide quantitative basis for clinical effect evaluation and auxiliary tool’s adjustment. This paper design a pressure monitoring system with 16 sensor points for Cerebral Palsy Children, and the monitoring system is mainly composed of three parts: a strain gauge array unit, signal conditioning and acquisition unit, data display and analysis. The research on pressure monitoring system based on the strain chip, is critical to study force between rehabilitation <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> and cerebral palsy children. In this paper, the works on the detailed description of each unit system, and reasonable verification of the experimental design provide solid foundation for the future studies...|$|R
25|$|The {{platforms}} for the {{two major}} national parties were similar in many respects. Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada (countries with which the islands had strong cultural and economic links); encouraging and expanding tourism; working to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Federation and to obtain loans, financial aid, and technical assistance. Despite these similarities, there were differences. The WIFLP had advocated the encouragement of agriculture while the DLP had promised a climate favourable to both private industry and labour, development of human and economic resources. The WIFLP promised to encourage the Bahamas (in addition to British Guiana and British Honduras) to join the Federation, whereas the DLP did not. The WIFLP also campaigned to establish a central bank for the extension of credit resources and advocated a democratic socialist society and full internal self-government for all the unit territories, whilst avoiding the issues of freedom of movement and a customs union. The DLP said nothing about full internal self-government, attacked socialism, wished to avoid high taxation (via loans and <b>technical</b> <b>aid)</b> and emphasized West Indian unity, freedom of worship and speech, and encouragement of trade unions.|$|E

Methods: Data collected in the European ENABLE-AGE study were used to identify people with self-reported Parkinson&# 39;s disease (n = 20) and to select three matched controls per individual (n = 60). The matching criteria were age (mean = 82 years), sex, country, and type of housing. Analyses targeted use and perceived unmet need of <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> and housing adaptations. Results: Very old people with self-reported Parkinson&# 39;s disease use significantly more aids for personal mobility than very old people in general. They have, furthermore, a significant increased unmet need concerning aids for personal care and protection. Housing adaptations did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: Since people with Parkinson&# 39;s disease use <b>technical</b> <b>aids</b> to a higher extent and express an unmet need, they may require more thorough counseling regarding <b>technical</b> <b>aids.</b> Thus, this explorative study provides important information for health care professionals, rehabilitation, and future research. Moreover, {{in order to develop}} knowledge about specific challenges connected to Parkinson&# 39;s disease among the very old, further and larger studies targeting environmental resources are needed.

[...] According to Mitchell, the projects USAID pursues are built on a discourse subservient to American political and economic interests and can potentially {{do more harm than good}} for Egyptians. He maintains that democracy rhetoric is also employed according to American-defined categories such as promoting economic liberalization, citing a 1989 USAID report's calls for political decentralization and encouraging [...] "democracy and pluralism" [...] as a means of empowering rural landlords who would support free market economy at the expense of local peasants.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Zaire's {{relationship}} with the People's Republic of China was no better than its {{relationship with}} the Soviet Union. Memories of Chinese aid to Mulele and other Maoist rebels in Kwilu province during the ill-fated Simba Rebellion remained fresh in Mobutu's mind. He also opposed seating the PRC at the United Nations. However, by 1972, he began to see the Chinese in a different light, as a counterbalance to both the Soviet Union as well as his intimate ties with the United States, Israel, and South Africa. In November 1972, Mobutu extended diplomatic recognition to the Chinese (as well as East Germany and North Korea). The following year, Mobutu paid a visit to Beijing, where he met personally with chairman Mao Zedong and received promises of $100million in <b>technical</b> <b>aid.</b> In 1974, Mobutu made a surprise visit to both China and North Korea, during the time he was originally scheduled to visit the Soviet Union. Upon returning home, both his politics and rhetoric became markedly more radical; it was around this time that Mobutu began criticizing Belgium and the United States (the latter for not doing enough, in Mobutu's opinion, to combat white minority rule in southern Africa), introduced the [...] "obligatory civic work" [...] program called salongo, and initiated [...] "radicalization" [...] (an extension of 1973's [...] "Zairianization" [...] policy). Mobutu even borrowed a title – the Helmsman – from Mao. Incidentally, late 1974-early 1975 was when his personality cult reached its peak.|$|E
