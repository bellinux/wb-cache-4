5|$|A {{positive}} {{development for the}} Allies during this <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> appearance of another Spanish force in the region. The Spanish Regency at Cádiz had sent General Joaquín Blake, with the two divisions of Zayas and Lardizábal, by sea to Ayamonte on {{the mouth of the}} Guadiana. Landing on 18 April, Blake's army moved to join General Francisco Ballesteros at the Spanish town of Xeres.|$|E

In 1567 he commanded a royal task force, sent to remove the noble family of Starzechowscy from the royal lands they were decreed to hold illegally. Another major task he completed at that <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> reorganization of the Chancellery archive.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> protective tariff. While {{it had not been}} a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive {{as opposed to the}} more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E

5|$|Chosen to play Quatermass was the {{distinguished}} actor John Mills, who {{had appeared in}} significant roles in many high-profile British films, including The Way to the Stars (1945), Great Expectations (1946) and Ice Cold in Alex (1958), and had won an Academy Award {{for his role in}} Ryan's Daughter (1970). Mills, whose only previous television credit at the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Zoo Gang (1974), was reluctant to take the part but was convinced by his wife, who liked the script. Following Quatermass he appeared in Gandhi (1982), Martin Chuzzlewit (1994) and Hamlet (1997), working right up to his death in 2005.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal.

He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E

For example, in a drill press, machining <b>time</b> <b>is</b> when <b>the</b> cutting edge <b>is</b> actually moving forward and making a hole.

5|$|In 1929 Wu {{graduated}} {{at the top}} of her class, and {{was admitted}} to the National Central University in Nanjing. According to the governmental regulations of the time, teacher-training college students wanting to move on to the universities needed to serve as schoolteachers for one year. In Wu's case, this was only nominally enforced. She went to teach at the Public School in Shanghai, the president of which at the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> philosopher Hu Shih, whose class she took.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{the entire}} length of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was widened into a divided highway, which at the <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best {{superhighway}} and the longest stretch of divided highway in the world. During the course of the 1930s, several other state roads were constructed while others were widened into divided highways. In 1935, the DSHD took over maintenance of all remaining county roads, tripling the mileage of the state highway system, and took over several city streets in Wilmington in 1936. Progress on improving the state highway system slowed during World War II; the only major project completed during that <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> construction of the high-level St. Georges Bridge to replace a lift bridge destroyed by a ship in 1939. Following the war, several highway improvement projects took place including widening more roads to divided highways. On August 16, 1951, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and its approach road opened to traffic, providing a fixed road link for US 40 across the Delaware River to New Jersey and replacing ferry service that previously existed. Following the completion of the bridge, traffic along US 13 and US 40 increased, with plans made for a new freeway to handle the increased traffic. In 1957, US 13 was widened into a divided highway between Greenwood and Harrington, providing a divided highway running the north-south length of the state.|$|E

As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students.|$|E

There was an estimated 67,000-strong crowd crammed in for the game, though other estimates vary widely, with a further 15,000 locked out as it became clear the stadium was full.
