40|$|Between April 2005 and March 2006 4 {{cases of}} human {{trichinellosis}} {{have been confirmed}} in the Sardinia region(Italy) {{as a result of}} the consumption of the row sausages obtained from free ranging pigs slaughtered illegally. To cope with further new outbreaks, the Sardinia region has undertaken series of actions, such as informative campaigns addressed to the consumers, <b>trichinoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the susceptible wildlife object of hunting as well as free ranging pigs illegally reared in the areas where human trichinellosis occurred. The investigations conducted so far indicate the absence of responsible parasite in the wild boar, while demonstrating its presence in the pigs reared in free ranging conditions, confirming the presence of some risk factors for the maintenance and spread of the parasite...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trichinoscopic</b> <b>examination,</b> pepsin-hydrogen {{chloride}} digestion and the ELISA assay {{were used}} in an epidemiological survey {{for the presence of}} Trichinella spiralis in slaughterhouse pigs over a period of 12 months. The first two methods failed to detect any cases of trichinellosis in sows aged between two to three years. The ELISA assay, however, detected a 2. 5 % prevalence amongst the 2046 blood specimens tested. Foci of T. spiralis are localized in certain regions only. The discrepancy between the results obtained is likely to be due to the low infection density, undetectable by conventional methods. It is postulated that pigs which are not confined indoors came in contact with the sylvatic strain of Trichinella which is known for low muscle invasiveness...|$|E
