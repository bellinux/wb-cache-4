5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} <b>the</b> <b>Naval</b> Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He {{was the first}} naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, <b>the</b> <b>Naval</b> Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. <b>The</b> <b>Naval</b> Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, <b>the</b> <b>Naval</b> Academy {{received}} accreditation as {{an approved}} technological institution.

50|$|In 1961, <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Naval</b> Forces Command was {{organized}} into four main subordinate commands: The Turkish Fleet Command, the Turkish Northern Sea Area Command, the Turkish Southern Sea Area Command and <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Naval</b> Training Command.

5|$|In case {{of war or}} {{national}} emergency, <b>the</b> <b>Naval</b> Staff was to become directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. <b>The</b> <b>Naval</b> Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain {{under the control of}} the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, <b>the</b> <b>naval</b> detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and <b>the</b> <b>Naval</b> Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E

5|$|A naval ensign {{has been}} used by Lithuania {{starting}} in 1992. The ensign has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7th of the total width of the ensign, with the ratio being 1:2. Historically, this flag was used as the ensign of the Kaunas Yacht Club, but with a different ratio of 2:3. <b>The</b> <b>naval</b> jack consists of a white field, charged with a blue anchor covered by <b>the</b> <b>naval</b> badge of Lithuania. The badge consists of the Columns of Gediminas in yellow on a red disc. A masthead pennant have been adopted by the Lithuanian Navy to use on their ships.|$|E

5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of <b>the</b> <b>Naval</b> Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of <b>the</b> <b>Naval</b> Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E
