5|$|In 1979, before {{construction}} {{had even}} begun, there was opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of Trump Tower and other {{buildings in the}} area. The New York Committee for a Balanced Building Boom {{was concerned about the}} planned rezoning of the area that would arise due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of high-rise towers along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 57th Streets.|$|E

5|$|The first {{woolen mill}} in Danville {{was built on}} Mahoning Creek. An {{agricultural}} fair was held on the creek in February 1856. Phillip Maus once built a sawmill on Mahoning Creek.

50|$|The dam {{is named}} after Nikolaos Plastiras, a Greek General and Politician who was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> {{visualize}} <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of a reservoir in the Agrafa area as soon as 1925.

5|$|A {{programme}} of work {{is scheduled}} {{to take place in}} 2018 to replace expansion joints in both towers along with replacing the truss end links. Plans to replace these joints were postponed by the bridge management following the Scottish Government's commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of the Queensferry Crossing; the original work proposals would have involved round-the-clock contraflows during the installation of ramps and mini-bridges to carry traffic over the work area, and heavy lorries being diverted.|$|E
5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E

Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra {{and the new}} field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E

After his firm failed in 1928, the architects William and Arthur Fisher were commissioned <b>to</b> continue <b>the</b> <b>construction.</b> World War II caused further delays <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building's <b>construction.</b> In 1948, <b>the</b> architect John Monroe was hired <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> building.|$|R
5|$|As well as solar alignments, {{there are}} {{proposed}} lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received. The Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth {{is no longer}} equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> era direction.|$|E
5|$|At {{ground level}} {{and inside the}} lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a hallway, and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley, on the 1846 {{junction}} of the London and Birmingham railway with the Bedford branch, {{was to become}} an important railway town too. In 1850, another branch from Bletchley to Oxford was built, later to become the (Cambridge/Oxford) Varsity Line. Bletchley, originally a small village in the parish of Fenny Stratford, grew to reach and absorb its parent. In Stony Stratford, expertise learned in the works was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of traction engines for agricultural use and {{the site of the}} present Cofferidge Close was engaged in their manufacture.|$|E

A study was instituted, from October 2005 to July 2006, to record the vegetation composition and productivity of phumdis in areas of ranging thickness, water depth and soil pH, accumulating data in both summer and winter. The study recorded 83 plant species of 21 families (Poaceae and Cyperaceae formed the dominant families); 81 species were recorded in summer and 48 in winter.|$|E
5|$|Charles Linza McNary (June 12, 1874February 25, 1944) was a United States Republican {{politician}} from Oregon.

In the Senate, McNary helped to pass legislation that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, and worked on agricultural and forestry issues.
