40|$|On September 1, 1983, {{over the}} Sea of Japan, a Soviet Union {{military}} aircraft destroyed a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 {{en route from}} Kennedy Airport in New York to Seoul, South Korea. All 269 persons on board the plane were killed. The Warsaw Convention (2 ̆ 2 Convention 2 ̆ 2), a multilateral treaty governing the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air, provides a per passenger damage limitation for personal injury or death. The Convention further provides that passenger tickets must include notice of this limitation, and a private accord among airlines known as the Montreal Agreement (2 ̆ 2 Agreement 2 ̆ 2) states <b>that</b> this <b>notice</b> <b>shall</b> be in print size no smaller than 10 -point type. In Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 2 ̆ 7 the United States Supreme Court held that international air carriers do not lose {{the benefit of the}} Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s damages limitation if they fail to provide <b>notice</b> of <b>that</b> limitation. Accordingly, the liability of Korean Air Lines was limited to 75, 000 per passenger. This Note first explores the majority and concurring opinions in Chan and concludes that the Court erred in enabling a carrier to benefit from the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s damage limitation when the carrier has failed to warn its passengers of that limitation. This Note further discusses how the Court created a confusing and disturbing precedent by failing to interpret the Montreal Agreement in conjunction with the Warsaw Convention, and by wrongly relying on a literal reading of the Warsaw Convention. for its conclusions. Finally, this Note asserts that the concurrence in Chan correctly resolved the fundamental issue by examining the drafting history of the Convention and concluding that an international air carrier cannot receive the benefit of the Convention 2 ̆ 7 s damage limitation if it fails to provide adequate <b>notice</b> of <b>that</b> limitation on passenger tickets. The concurrence failed, however, to appreciate the relationship between the Montreal Agreement and the Convention and replaced a clear standard of adequate notice with an unclear standard...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two ways}} for the {{employee}} to terminate the employment contract - through a proper <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>shall</b> be given within the specified period, and extraordinary notice. In both cases this is a subjective right of the worker. According to Art. 326(2) of the Labour Code, the notice period varies {{depending on whether the}} working contract is permanent and temporary. In case of a permanent contract, the law in Bulgaria provides for a notice period of 30 days, as long as the parties have not previously agreed on a longer period (that shall not exceed 3 months). The minimum notice period for temporary contract termination is 3 months. In accordance with Art. 326(4) of the Labour Code the termination notice may be revoked by the employee simultaneously or prior to its receipt by the employer. Afterwards, a notice may be withdrawn {{by the end of the}} notice period with the consent of the employer (Art. 326(4) LC). It is possible for employees in Bulgaria to terminate the employment contract without notice as well, but only for a particular reason, as provided in Art.327 of the Labour Code. The most significant ground therein is a scenario where the employer is reluctant to pay the employee his due remuneration. Under the applicable labour law provisions even a delay of one day is sufficient for the employee to unilaterally terminate the employment relationship without complying with the usual notice periods.|$|R
