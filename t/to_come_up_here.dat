500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a little fun [...] who wants <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E

Inside, the house is full of books and art works: small sculptures, paintings, prints, postcards, ceramics, {{aboriginal}} artefacts and bark paintings, cover every available surface. King said: “Robin Boyd used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and say ‘This house should look awful, but it doesn't.’” ...|$|E

6000|$|The charwoman {{in charge}} of the {{scrubbing}} of the studio knocked at her door: [...] "Beg y' pardon, miss, but in cleanin' of a floor there's two, not to say three, kind of soap, which is yaller, an' mottled, an' disinfectink. Now, jist before I took my pail into the passage I though it would be pre'aps jest as well if I was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>'ere</b> an' ask you what sort of soap you was wishful that I should use on them boards.

6000|$|... “Ay,” she said. “I couldna {{bear the}} roof either. It’s {{a habit of}} mine <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> about the gloaming when it’s quaiet and caller.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My good sir," [...] said Mr. Cunningham {{with some}} impatience, [...] "this is surely very unnecessary. That is my {{room at the}} end of the stairs, and my son's is the one beyond it. I leave it to your {{judgment}} whether it was possible for the thief <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> without disturbing us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not!" [...] {{retorted}} Old Mr. Toad. [...] "Use your common sense, Peter Rabbit. If I {{had spent}} the winter in the Smiling Pool, do you suppose I would have left it <b>to</b> <b>come</b> way <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and then have turned right around and gone back there to sing? I'm not so fond of long journeys as all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Ah! well, I'm glad of it,--very glad," [...] said Mr. Shelby, heartily. [...] "Tom, I suppose, {{will get}} {{reconciled}} to a Southern residence;--hardly want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning to you," [...] he said, {{and added}} [...] "I've blundered badly, so I have. I {{should have known}} better than <b>to</b> <b>come</b> so close <b>to</b> Jamaica by night.

6000|$|... "After I got {{the claims}} at Squaw Creek {{opened up and}} some men <b>to</b> working, I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> {{by way of the}} Stewart, hunting for Two Cabins. They'd beaten me to it, so I've been higher up the Stewart. Just got back {{yesterday}} out of grub." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, like Juliet Bingham. It {{was your}} voice made me think--it was your voice that first {{made me want}} to see you, that made me write to you, in the beginning. I heard you talking that night in the hotel, where you left that circular; you were in the room next to mine; and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> right <b>up</b> <b>here</b> then; but I {{had to go back to}} New York, and so I wrote to you.

6000|$|... "It {{requires}} less bravery <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> with a message, Aemilia, than to {{run away}} from Rome with an outlaw who had just bearded Caesar in his palace." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{stand the}} climate," [...] he said. [...] "And I shan't attempt <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> again. If father will let me, I'll {{go to college}} and become a lawyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what it seems to me?" [...] he said. [...] "You will laugh perhaps, but the thought has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me <b>up</b> <b>here</b> that God has some fine use for me.

2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career. [...] "I was thinking it wouldn't be bad <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and kind of follow the same steps as Pinner – play here a couple years and maybe {{get a chance to}} coach up here", Williams said. [...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I <b>come</b> <b>to</b> work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I see one house," [...] he said. [...] "Here-away, on the {{mainland}} to the right." [...] He looked again, to make sure, at a dim little patch of white, with faint white lines behind it, nestling low in a grassy hollow, on the main island. [...] "It looks like a stone house and inclosure," [...] he resumed. [...] "I'll hail it, on the chance." [...] He passed his arm round a rope to steady himself, made a speaking-trumpet of his hands, and suddenly dropped them again without uttering a sound. [...] "It's so awfully quiet," [...] he whispered to himself. [...] "I'm half afraid to call out." [...] He looked down again on deck. [...] "I shan't startle you, Midwinter, shall I?" [...] he said, with an uneasy laugh. He looked once more at the faint white object, in the grassy hollow. [...] "It won't do <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> for nothing," [...] he thought, and made a speaking-trumpet of his hands again. This time he gave the hail with the whole power of his lungs. [...] "On shore there!" [...] he shouted, turning {{his face to the}} main island. [...] "Ahoy-hoy-hoy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Oh! Ask him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> please.--Nettie! Nettie!" [...] She {{calls to}} her friend in the next room. [...] "He's coming right up, and if you don't run you're trapped." ...|$|E
6000|$|He smiled unpleasantly. [...] "It is this to me: {{that if the}} bargelli were <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and {{discover}} a stolen mule in my stables, {{it would be an}} ill thing for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're quite right, Mr Fisher,' I said. 'But don't forget I {{still have}} the pistol, even if I haven't the shells. The first man who tries <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> will have a {{headache}} tomorrow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{know it is}} no use {{trying to}} hide our trail here; the two bands of Indians will follow, one up and one down, until they meet {{at the spot where}} the chief joined us. From there they can track us easy enough. Nothing would suit us better than for them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> us <b>here,</b> for we should give them fits, sartin. This is a good place. This little stream comes down from that snow peak you see over there, and we have got {{everything}} we want, for this patch of bushes will keep us in firing for a bit. You see, there are some more big hills in front of us, and we are better here than we should be among them. I expect we shall camp here for the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{or about}} the day you receive this letter, Anna, the six [...] months will be up. Do you expect me, I wonder. I think not.
