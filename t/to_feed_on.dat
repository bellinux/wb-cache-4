5|$|Host {{organisms that}} dive under water <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> aquatic prey harbor fewer taxa of lice.|$|E
5|$|Squirrels {{have been}} known <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> C.cinnabarinum, {{although}} its gelatinous coating deters insect predation.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species are}} known <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> dead {{arthropods}} (scavenging), web silk, {{and their own}} shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and {{studies have shown that}} young spiders {{have a better chance of}} survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
50|$|Larva known <b>to</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> lichens and mosses.|$|R
50|$|Larva known <b>to</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> {{plants like}} Albizia lebbeck, Pithecollobium dulce, Albizia saman, Acacia, Rosa, Salix.|$|R
50|$|They {{are mainly}} herbivores, in 84% of their nourishment. They {{progress}} from <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> phytoplankton and zooplankton, like larvae, <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> benthic macroalgae and small invertebrates.|$|R
5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of many stick insects, {{including}} Timema, {{are attractive}} to ants, who carry them away to their burrows <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the egg's capitulum, while leaving {{the rest of}} the egg intact to hatch. The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation {{to blend in with}} the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
500|$|They {{initially}} fed on the ectoparasites {{of large}} mammals, and then progressed <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the mammals themselves (similar <b>to</b> red-billed oxpecker <b>feeding</b> behavior) ...|$|R
500|$|They {{initially}} fed on {{insects that}} {{were attracted to}} the wounds of animals, and then progressed <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the wounds ...|$|R
25|$|Some wasps, {{such as the}} Polistes versicolor, even consume honey themselves, {{switching}} from <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> pollen {{in the middle of}} their lifecycles <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> honey, which can better provide for their energy needs.|$|R
5|$|The wasps {{preferentially}} {{hunt for}} female cicadas {{because they have}} more consumable tissue, but male cicadas are easier to locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly hunt for Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them to hunt for cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly into the trees <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> sap, and the species has been known <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> nectar.|$|E
5|$|Their {{habit of}} preying on bees makes them a {{nuisance}} to bee-keepers, but farmers attract {{them to their}} fields using artificial perches in fields to encourage them <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> pest insects.|$|E
5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{are very}} likely to be {{unpalatable}} to vertebrates, due <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> Aristolochia as a larva, although they do sometimes fall prey to the golden silk orb-weaver spider.|$|R
2500|$|Judy Massare {{studied the}} anatomy of {{mosasaur}} teeth and its implication for their diet. She argued that the [...] "slender", recurved teeth of Platecarpus were adapted <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> relatively small, soft prey like squid.|$|R
50|$|An impendent hyposome is {{attached}} to the anterior doublure but not aligned with the front edge of the glabella. Many impendent hypostomes have prongs, grooves and other adaptations thought <b>to</b> relate <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> complex food sources.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned {{to this type of}} feeding.|$|E
5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} land snails. Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails have generally been collected while they were crawling on trees or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
5|$|Anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, {{echidnas}} and numbats {{have special}} adaptations for {{living on a}} diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) have been found <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.|$|E
50|$|Rasnitsyn {{suggested}} his own hypothesis on {{the origin}} of insect flight. According to him, the wings first evolved, as a means to control gliding, in relatively large insects that had turned <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> generative organs of arboreal plants.|$|R
50|$|Mallon et al. (2013) {{examined}} herbivore coexistence on {{the island}} continent of Laramidia, during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that small ornithischians like Orodromeus were generally restricted <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> vegetation at, or below the height of 1 meter.|$|R
50|$|The larvae of most tineids (e.g. clothes moths) {{have adapted}} <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> non-herbaceous material, but Ceratophaga are {{especially}} remarkable {{in that they}} <b>feed,</b> apparently exclusively, <b>on</b> solid keratin from dead vertebrates. For most species this means the horns and hooves of ungulates but the North American C. vicinella <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> the shells of the tortoise Gopherus polyphemus.|$|R
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not require}} photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E
5|$|In captivity {{the green}} and golden bell frog is known <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> crickets, fruit flies, maggots, silkworms, {{domestic}} flies, beetles, mealworms, larvae, slaters, cockroaches, molluscs, plague locusts, spiders, water snails, earthworms, and mice. A case of a small tiger snake being eaten has also been reported. Captive frogs have a habit of not responding to stationary food items, which has helped to form {{the belief that the}} frog will eat most things that move.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of young and mature aphids on the leaf surfaces is dictated by their stylet length - the short stylets of young aphids cannot penetrate the lignin of the sclerenchyma of large veins {{and are thus}} restricted <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> smaller veins.|$|R
50|$|Jadera haematoloma, the red-shouldered bug, goldenrain-tree bug or soapberry bug is {{a species}} of true bug that lives {{throughout}} the United States and south to northern South America. It <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> seeds within the soapberry plant family, Sapindaceae, and is known to rapidly adapt <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> particular hosts. People often confuse this species with the boxelder bug.|$|R
50|$|These beetles are nocturnal, {{and their}} feeding {{behaviour}} is unknown. Adult stag beetles worldwide have mouthparts suited <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> liquids. Geodorcus helmsi {{has been seen}} <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> sappy exudations on tree trunks. Rotting wood, tree roots or humus {{are the most common}} food sources for stag beetle larvae, and G. ithaginis lives in an environment of enriched humus.|$|R
5|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{lives in}} burrows among vegetation, at altitudes {{of up to}} , {{emerging}} at night <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> plant matter and occasionally on animals. From January to March there is an annual migration to the sea to release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material sent {{to him by the}} naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship Astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{primates}} in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.|$|E
5|$|Megachilid bees of {{the genus}} Anthidium use the hair (amongst that of various woolly plants) in making their nests. The seeds are {{generally}} too small for birds <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> <b>on,</b> although the American goldfinch {{has been reported to}} consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E
50|$|The Cimicomorpha are an infraorder {{of insects}} {{in the order}} Hemiptera, the true bugs. The rostrum and other {{morphology}} of all members apparently is adapted <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> animals as their prey or hosts. Members include bed bugs, bat bugs, assassin bugs, and pirate bugs.|$|R
50|$|The {{pleasant}} bolo mouse is diurnal {{and seems}} <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> mostly <b>on</b> insects.|$|R
50|$|They appear <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> {{exclusively}} <b>on</b> insects, including locusts, termites, {{and insect}} eggs.|$|R
