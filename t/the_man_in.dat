5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, may {{represent}} the Moon, {{which would be the}} earliest depiction discovered. The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the debacle}} of The Road Back, Charles Rogers {{tried to get}} out of his {{contract}} with Whale; Whale refused.

5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

5|$|McColley knew of {{only one}} {{surviving}} copy of the first edition, held at the British Museum (now British Library C.56.c.2), which {{was the basis for}} his 1937 edition of <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> the Moone and Nuncius Inanimatus, an edition criticised by literary critic Kathleen Tillotson as lacking in textual care and consistency. H. W. Lawton's review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, V.20973 (now RES P- V- 752 (6)), an omission also noted by Tillotson.|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Simek {{states that}} the obscurity {{of the names of}} the objects in the tale of Hjúki and Bil may {{indicate}} that Snorri derived them from a folktale, and that the form of the tale of <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> the Moon (featuring a man with a pole and a woman with a bushel) is also found in modern folklore in Scandinavia, England, and Northern Germany.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> the Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E
