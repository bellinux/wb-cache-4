5|$|While these {{specific}} failings {{came back to}} haunt the Empire in subsequent decades, perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure {{to take into account}} the growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; <b>the</b> <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and <b>the</b> <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Augsburg agreement, their religious beliefs remained heretical.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} Arsacid patronism of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship. <b>The</b> <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> Zoroaster {{would have found}} the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable.

The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.|$|E

According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. <b>The</b> <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|For a {{brief period}} {{following}} {{the decline of the}} Vijayanagara Empire, the devotional movement seemed to lose momentum, only to become active again in the 17th century, producing an estimated 300 poets in this genre; famous among them are Vijaya Dasa (1682–1755), Gopala Dasa (1721–1769), Jagannatha Dasa (1728–1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others. Over time, their devotional songs inspired a form of religious and didactic performing art of the Vaishnava people called the Harikatha ("Stories of Hari"). Similar developments were seen among <b>the</b> <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> the Veerashaiva faith, who popularised the Shivakatha ("Stories of Shiva").|$|E
