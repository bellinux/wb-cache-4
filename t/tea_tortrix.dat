50|$|A 2013 study {{analyzed}} {{population dynamics}} of the smaller <b>tea</b> <b>tortrix,</b> a moth pest that infests tea plantations, especially in Japan. The data consisted of counts of adult moths captured with light traps every 5-6 days at the Kagoshima tea station in Japan from 1961-2012. Peak populations were 100 to 4000 times higher than at their lowest levels. A wavelet decomposition showed a clear, relatively stationary annual cycle in the populations, as well as non-stationary punctuations between late April and early October, representing 4-6 outbreaks per year of this multivoltine species. The cycles result from population overshoot.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 the Tea Research Institute {{commenced}} work on {{vegetative propagation}} at St. Coombs Estate in Talawakele, and by 1940 it {{had developed a}} biological control (a parasitic wasp, Macrosentus homonae) to suppress the <b>Tea</b> <b>Tortrix</b> caterpillar, which had threatened the tea crop. In 1941 the first Ceylonese tea broking house, M/s Pieris & Abeywardena, was established, and in 1944 the Ceylon Estate Employers' Federation was founded. On October 1, 1951, an export duty on tea was introduced and in 1955 the first clonal tea fields began cultivation. In 1958, the State Plantations Corporation was established, and on June 1, 1959, Ad Valorem Tax was introduced for teas sold at the Colombo auctions.|$|E
40|$|The aerial {{concentration}} of a synthetic sex pheromone component (Z- 11 -tetradecenyl acetate) and the mating ratio of tethered females {{of the smaller}} <b>tea</b> <b>tortrix</b> were measured under field conditions. The aerial {{concentration of}} the pheromone component and mating ratio show a logarithmic linear relationship. The aerial concentration of the synthetic pheromone component should be more than 20 ng/m^ 3 to suppress the mating to less than 30 %...|$|E
40|$|Maternally {{inherited}} female-biased sex ratios {{have been}} documented in many invertebrate species. One cause of such biased sex ratios is male killing, i. e. only males die. In most species, male killing occurs during embryonic stages (early male killing) and is associated with cytoplasmic bacteria, including Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Rickettsia, Flavobacteria and gamma proteobacteria. However, the oriental <b>tea</b> <b>tortrix,</b> Homona magnanima, {{is one of the}} few species in which male death occurs in the larval or pupal stage, and is thus an example of late male killing. We partially purified the agent causing late male killing in H. magnanima and showed that it consists of two RNA sequences. This represents an entirely novel agent causing late male killing...|$|E
40|$|The smaller <b>tea</b> <b>tortrix,</b> Adoxophyes honmai (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is an {{economically}} important pest of tea in Japan. Previous work {{showed that a}} fast-killing nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) isolated from A. orana (AdorNPV) and a slow-killing NPV isolated from A. honmai (AdhoNPV) are both infectious to A. honmai larvae. Field application of these different NPVs was conducted against an A. honmai larval population in tea plants, and the control efficacy and transmission rate of the two NPVs were compared. The slow-killing AdhoNPV showed lower field efficacy, in terms of preventing damage caused by A. honmai larvae against the tea plants, than the fast-killing AdorNPV. However, AdhoNPV had a significantly higher horizontal transmission rate than AdorNPV. These results show that AdorNPV is suitable as an inundative agent, while AdhoNPV is an appropriate inoculative agent...|$|E
40|$|Hydrolytic kinetic {{resolution}} (HKR) of functionalised epoxides using (salen) Co(OAc) complexes provides enantiomerically enriched epoxides and diols, {{which have}} been transformed into important insect sex pheromones. In this general approach, (-) -(R) - and (+) -(S) - 10 -methyldodecyl acetates from the smaller <b>tea</b> <b>tortrix</b> moth were obtained, as was (-) -(R) - 10 -methyltridecan- 2 -one from the southern corn rootworm. The (S) -epoxide obtained from undec- 1 -en- 6 -yne was transformed to (-) -(R) -(Z) -undec- 6 -en- 2 -ol (Nostrenol) from ant-lions. HKR of appropriate bisepoxides was also investigated, and transformations of the resulting bisepoxides and epoxydiols provided (-) -(1 R, 7 R) - 1, 7 -dimethylnonylpropanoate from corn rootworms, (-) -(6 R, 12 R) - 6, 12 -dimethylpentadecan- 2 -one from the female banded cucumber beetle, and (-) -(2 S, 11 S) - 2, 11 -diacetoxytridecane and (+) -(2 S, 12 S) - 2, 12 -diacetoxytridecane from female pea-midges.

40|$|The smaller <b>tea</b> <b>tortrix,</b> Adoxophyes honmai (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of tea plants in Japan. Adoxophyes honmai nucleopolyhedrovirus (AdhoNPV) isolates from Tsukuba (AdhoNPV-Ts) and Tokyo (AdhoNPV-To), Japan, and Adoxophyes orana nucleopolyhedrovirus (AdorNPV) isolates from England (AdorNPV-En) and the Netherlands (AdorNPV-Ne) were subjected to genetic and biological comparisons to select a candidate NPV isolate to control A. honmai. Restriction endonuclease (REN) analysis demonstrated that AdhoNPV-Ts and AdhoNPV-To had similar REN patterns, whereas AdorNPV-En and AdorNPV-Ne exhibited different REN patterns from each other as well as those of AdhoNPV-Ts and AdhoNPV-To. Bioassays with fourth-instar A. honmai larvae showed that AdorNPV-En was most pathogenic, with the lowest LD 50 of 37 occlusion bodies (OBs) per larva. When A. honmai neonates were inoculated with each isolate, most larvae infected with AdhoNPV-Ts and AdhoNPV-To were killed in the final (fifth) -instar, whereas larvae infected with AdorNPV-Ne were killed at every instar and larvae infected with AdorNPV-En were killed at the first- to third-instar. AdorNPV-En or AdhoNPV-Ts fed to neonates had the shortest or longest killing times, respectively, with ST 50 values of 6 and 19 days. AdhoNPV-To and AdorNPV-Ne had intermediate killing times. The OB yield per larva of AdhoNPV-Ts and AdhoNPV-To was significantly higher than that of AdorNPV-En and AdorNPV-Ne. Our results suggest that AdorNPV-En is suitable as an inundative agent because it is a quick-killing, highly virulent NPV, and AdhoNPV-Ts and AdhoNPV-To are more appropriately used as inoculative agents because of their high OB production.
