5|$|Olivia and Peter learn Greg {{was being}} treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had {{involved}} demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) and Nina (Blair Brown) reveal new information leading to <b>the</b> <b>sleep</b> researcher Dr. Nayak (Ravi Kapoor) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is detrimental to immune function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α produced in response to infection, appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to <b>the</b> <b>sleep</b> cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging <b>the</b> <b>sleep</b> time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with <b>the</b> <b>sleep</b> issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E

5|$|In January2014, Iwata {{unveiled}} a ten-year {{strategy for the}} company based on quality of life products. The target was a new market outside video games. Developed under partnerships with Dr. Yasuyoshi Watanabe and ResMed, the first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in October2014. Unlike the Vitality Sensor, <b>the</b> <b>sleep</b> sensor {{was to be a}} stand-alone product that {{does not need to be}} worn. Following Iwata's death in July2015, analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality of life initiative. Despite a planned United States release in March2016, some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved, while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it. The device was formally discontinued by February2016; however, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the {{fourteen}} Black Paintings that Goya applied in oil on the plaster walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, Witches' Sabbath is generally seen by art historians as a satire on the credulity of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the witch trials of the Spanish Inquisition. As with the other works in the group, Witches' Sabbath reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching <b>The</b> <b>Sleep</b> of Reason Produces Monsters as well as the Disasters of War print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.|$|E
