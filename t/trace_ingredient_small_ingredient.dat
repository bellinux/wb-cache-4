40|$|The "theory of the dream" {{discussed}} in the final section of the Theaetetus {{is based on a}} proportion: stoicheion is to syllabé as onoma is to logos. The four terms indicate the simple and the complex in the two components, phonic and semantic, of language. More specifically, logos does not mean "reason", stoicheion does not mean "letter" and syllabé does not only mean "syllable". Logos does not mean "reason". In the final part of Theaetetus, logos is associated with "lego" ("to say"), and opposed to onoma ("name", "word"). In this context, logos thus means "discourse", "speech"; and hence "statement" and "definition". Syllabé does not only mean "syllable". Deriving from syllambano (to take toghether), syllabé means first of all "connection", "nexus", "bond". As a phonetic term, syllabé points out the smallest unit of pronuntiation within which single sounds, represented by letters (grammata), are produced and perceived. Stoicheion does not mean "letter. Stoicheion, from steicho ("move in well- ordered ranks"), stoichos (not "alignement" but "progression", "order"), is a technical term of mousiké as a unit of rhythm, harmony and word. Stoicheion comes into being with the tripartite classifications of linguistic sound worked out by experts on metrics, and it indicates the <b>smallest</b> <b>ingredient</b> of pronuntiation, abstractable, not extractable, from its context of production, the syllable, which is the smallest unit of the rythmic progression of verse. Stoicheion is not the graphic character; it is the <b>smallest</b> <b>ingredient</b> of pronunciation, seen as a stage in the orderly succession of rules of formation of the syllable. The "theory of the dream", in actual fact, assimilates stoicheia to grammata, and, for this reason too, will be refuted. Starting from the Sophist, Plato was to work out an alternativ theoretical model, based on the metaphor of "interweaving" and the "bond", which makes it possible to define the syllable starting from the elements, and viceversa. In this new phase of platonic thought, stoicheion becomes a key theoretical term. The use of stoicheion in Plato reflects the procedures of reading scriptio continua aloud; and shows how in Greece orality and writing are practices that are not opposed but closely integrated...|$|R

This approach focuses on working “upwards ” towards creativity, by examining <b>smaller,</b> <b>ingredient</b> decisions that make a difference to the result. As the amount of creativity displayed by a design is a judgment made by some person or group, it should be possible to investigate the degree of impact of changes to routine design mechanisms.

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} {{is a new}} separation technique. It is {{an analytical}} technique that usually complements or replaces high performance liquid chromatography. Basic principle of the technique is the migration of charged species under applied electric field towards one of the electrodes through a narrow capillary filled with electrolyte solution. Main advantages over other chromatographic methods are short analysis time, high efficiency, small sample and solvent volumes, low costs, simplicity and ecological acceptability. Capillary electrophoresis has several modes of separation which allows analysis {{of different types of}} analytes. Capillary electrophoresis has found its application in the drug analysis of large molecules like proteins, peptides and nucleic acids, small organic molecules such as drugs, hormones, plant metabolites, food product <b>ingredients,</b> <b>small</b> inorganic ions etc. It is a method of choice when rapid results are needed.

40|$|Complex {{synthetic}} formulations {{based on}} polysorbates {{can be challenging}} to characterize. They may be composed of many similar products {{including those of the}} same molecular weight, which cannot be readily separated by separation science approaches. Carbon number variation and ethylene oxide distribution add to the complexity. The properties of these formulations will be dependent on the chemical structure and relative concentration of formulation components. Here we describe the use of two experimental approaches based on mass spectrometry to provide enhanced characterization of these formulations. The first utilizes an atmospheric pressure solids analysis probe to rapidly determine the percentage content of individual esters in a formulation. These are shown to be in good agreement with product specification sheets. In a second approach, mobility separation has been integrated into a MALDI-MS/MS experiment to categorize major, minor, and <b>trace</b> <b>ingredients.</b> Components of identical molecular mass in the polysorbate formulations have been separated by ion mobility and then fragmented for additional characterization.

The use of hydrophobins in pharmaceutical formulations and in medicine is another interesting application as they cause an increased stabilization of drugs.

To recognize the positive and the negative aspects of hydrophobins these proteins should be commercially available at large scale which however is not the case.

Digestibility of gross energy (GE) was determined using titanium dioxide as an indigestible marker, and the DE content of rice was calculated by subtracting the DE content of ingredients other than rice. The mean (±S. E. M.) coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of GE and DE content (MJ/kg air-dry basis) of rice were 0. 92 (0. 003) and 15. 1 (0. 06), respectively. The rice variety did not influence the DE content. However, the body weight of the pig significantly influenced the DE content of rice such that weaner pigs extracted less energy from a given rice than grower pigs (up to 0. 5 MJ/kg, P< 0. 001). In the second experiment, the CTTAD of GE and DE content (MJ/kg DM) of cooked medium-grain rice Amaroo (autoclaved for 20 min at 120 °C; rice:water ratio of 1 : 2, w/w) was examined in 10 kg pigs.
