50|$|RFV, {{as well as}} {{all other}} force {{variation}} measurements, can be shown as a complex waveform. This waveform can be expressed according to its harmonics by applying Fourier Transform (FT). FT permits one to parameterize various aspects of the tire dynamic behavior. The first harmonic, expressed as RF1H (radial force first harmonic) describes the force variation magnitude that exerts a pulse into the vehicle one time for each rotation. RF2H expresses the magnitude of the radial force that exerts a pulse twice per revolution, and so on. Often, these harmonics have known causes, and can be used to diagnose production problems. For example, a <b>tire</b> <b>mold</b> installed with 8 bolts may thermally deform as to induce an eighth harmonic, so the presence of a high RF8H would point to a mold bolting problem. RF1H is the primary source of ride disturbances, followed by RF2H. High harmonics are less problematic because the rotating speed of the tire at highway speeds times the harmonic value makes disturbances at such high frequencies that they are damped or overcome by other vehicle dynamic conditions.|$|E

40|$|Received xxxx; {{received}} in revised form xxxx; accepted xxxx Available online xxxx This paper presents a parametric design system for 3 D <b>tire</b> <b>mold</b> production. Tire grooves {{commonly used in}} the current industry are classified according to their modeling procedures, and the design parameters for each groove type are characterized. The result serves {{as a foundation for}} standardization of the <b>tire</b> <b>mold</b> design. The presented system simplifies the construction of 3 D groove surfaces by reducing the number of interactive modeling operations. The resultant surface model is parameterized and thus allows for rapid creation of other grooves with simple design tables. In addition, a set of geometric algorithms is proposed that first detects undesired groove geometries arising in the design process, and then corrects them automatically. In this manner 3 D mold models are created with minimal user interactions. This work is implemented in an integrated CAD/CAM system for actual mold production. Test examples demonstrate that it provides an effective approach to reducing the time yet improving the quality of <b>tire</b> <b>mold</b> development. XXXX Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} surface {{alteration}} of gasket samples commercialized by two alternative producers. These gaskets, in polymeric materials, are installed in process plants used for cleaning <b>tires</b> <b>molds</b> by a pioneering ultrasonic process. They {{are exposed to}} a combination of ultrasonic waves, temperature, humidity and acid attack causing several erosion phenomena. Their surface degradation under ordinary operative conditions was investigated using mechanical and tribological tests. The experimental characterization was performed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermograms, differential scanning calorimetry curves and infrared spectra aiming at defining the specific mechanics of wearing. As a conclusion, it was possible to state that even if samples exhibit similar chemical structures, their thermal and mechanical properties as well as their geometric dimensions are different. Such differences in the materials might cause various unexpected wear behaviors when gaskets are employed in the same working conditions. ...|$|R

AC 4 C casting material and AC 7 A casting material were heated in smelting furnace at about 650 Â°C and 670 Â°C, and then they injected into the metal mold device when the melting process was completely finished, respectively. When the melted casting material was completely injected into the metal mold device, the temperature inside the casting was measured by 9 measurement points. Also, when the temperature inside the casting was measured approximately 500 Â°C during the cooling process, the casting is separated to metal mold device and carried out cooling at normal temperature. The separating time from metal mold device of AC 4 C casting material and AC 7 A casting material have been taken 25 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. The final cooling time of AC 4 C casting material and AC 7 A casting material have been taken 400 minutes and 380 minutes, respectively.

40|$|To produce thin grooves in {{the tread}} portion of <b>tires,</b> <b>tire</b> <b>molds</b> contain a {{multitude}} of sipes, which are thin metal inserts that project into the tread rubber during molding and curing. The geometric design and location of sipes is based on tire performance as well as appearance. A complete `family' of tires, typically consisting of {{a dozen or more}} tire sizes with similar tread designs, will require thousands of sipes, many of which have very similar geometry. Sipe consolidation can reduce the number of unique sipes required by an order of magnitude or better, significantly reducing tooling costs and fabrication times. Sipe consolidation can be achieved by grouping similar sipes into clusters so that one sipe can represent all sipes in the cluster. A rigorous investigation of sipe parameters and optimal clustering methods is desired. 1. Introduction. Michelin {{is one of the largest}} tire manufacturers in the world.

50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green <b>tire</b> in a <b>mold</b> in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the green <b>tire,</b> and the <b>mold</b> closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the <b>mold.</b> The <b>tire</b> may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|R
