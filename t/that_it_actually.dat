5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone.

5|$|As {{the island}} rebuilt from the 1900 storm, {{legitimate}} business interests attempted {{to expand the}} economy by rebuilding tourism and further diversifying from shipping. Important non-entertainment businesses included insurance, hotels, banks, shipping, and commercial fishing.Obadele-Starks (2000), p. 4. The medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals of the University of Texas Medical Branch were a stable sector on the island throughout the 20th century. The Moody family built one of the largest hotel empires in the U.S., and their American National Insurance Company (ANICO) was so successful <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> grew—tremendously—during the Depression.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, the Army had more equipment <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E

25|$|Graduals are responsorial chants {{that follow}} {{the reading of}} the Epistle.

Graduals are accompanied by an elaborate Verse, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> consists in two different parts, A B. Often the first part is sung again, creating a 'rondeau' A B A. At least the verse, if not the complete gradual, is for the solo cantor and are in elaborate, ornate style with long, wide-ranged melismata.|$|E
25|$|Teresa {{entered a}} Carmelite Monastery of the Incarnation in Ávila, Spain, on 2 November 1535. She found herself {{increasingly}} in disharmony with the spiritual malaise prevailing at the monastery. Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of cloister — {{designed to protect}} and strengthen the spirit and practice of prayer — became so lax <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> lost its very purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, spoiled the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vain conversations. These violations of the solitude absolutely essential to progress in genuine contemplative prayer grieved Teresa {{to the extent that}} she longed to do something.|$|E

25|$|The Monroe Doctrine {{appeared}} to some South American {{states as a}} US attempt of preserving their control over that hemisphere. Brazil viewed this doctrine {{as a measure of}} protection against the interference of the US and from European nations. Brazil's first ambassador to the United States, Joaquim Nabuco, 1905–10, was a partisan of the Monroe Doctrine. Brazil borrowed money from many nations {{but it was not until}} after World War One <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> borrowed substantial amounts from the US.

25|$|On September 22, 2015, {{federal judge}} George H. King {{ruled that the}} Warner/Chappell {{copyright}} claim over the lyrics was invalid. The 1935 copyright held by Warner/Chappell applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, not the lyrics or melody. The {{court held that the}} question of whether the 1922 and 1927 publications were authorized, thus placing the song in the public domain, presented questions of fact that would need to be resolved at trial. However, Warner/Chappell had failed to prove <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> had ever held a copyright to the lyrics, so the court was able to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs, thus resolving the case.|$|E
25|$|A new {{sewage system}} {{was built on}} Don's orders in 1815, but this was so poorly {{designed}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> worsened Gibraltar's sanitary problems. It had no ability to be flushed and was insufficiently inclined to keep the sewage flowing out to the bay. As a result, the system merely brought sewage down from {{the upper part of}} the town to the lower part, where it piled up under the main streets. The sewage remained there until the winter rains dislodged it and flushed it into the bay. Because the outfalls were so short, however, the sewage simply washed back up onto the shoreline and resulted in the seafront being coated in a slick of effluent.|$|E

25|$|In August 1797, Captain Thomas, of Nonsuch, {{seized the}} {{merchant}} vessel Arminde, Barizy, master, off Penang (equally Pedir Roads, i.e., {{the north coast}} of Sumatra). Captain Barizy was a Frenchman, and Armida and her cargo was sold as a prize {{on the grounds that}} she was carrying enemy goods. However, the vessel was travelling on behalf of the King of Cochin China and carrying a cargo of sugar consigned to the King's agents, the Danish firm of Harrop and Stevenson of Tranquebar, then a Danish colony. The King made a number of inquiries and eventually the EIC returned Armide to Saigon and agreed to compensate the King for the loss of his cargo, though it is not clear <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> did pay the compensation.|$|E
25|$|Since Everett's {{original}} work, {{there have}} appeared {{a number of}} similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction {{is not simply a}} description of the object's state, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>actually</b> is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the Copenhagen interpretation which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.|$|E

The FBI said that it interviewed him and relatives of his, but did not find any terrorist activity, and that it provided the results in the summer of 2011. At that point, the FBI asked the FSB for more information, but the Russians did not respond to the American request, and the FBI officially closed the case.|$|E
