5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation <b>to</b> <b>decontaminate</b> uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|After {{a five-day}} away mission spent apologising {{on the planet}} Kreetassa, the away team {{consisting}} of Captain Archer, Sub-Commander T'Pol, Ensign Sato, and Archer's dog, Porthos, return to the ship <b>to</b> <b>decontaminate.</b> Porthos has acquired a pathogen on the planet surface and must be quarantined. Archer learns from Commander Tucker of the ship's need for an extra plasma injector from the Kreetassans, but negotiations break down after it is discovered that Porthos had urinated on a sacred tree, insulting the Kreetassans. Archer reacts poorly to the news and is given a list of requirements he must meet in order to apologise.|$|E
5|$|Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a {{pre-existing}} system produced deadly flooding, {{and when}} the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much {{of the town and}} leaving residents without water or power. Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various international agencies to deploy teams <b>to</b> <b>decontaminate</b> wells. Haruna destroyed 7,402houses, which left 13,882people homeless. Most of the displaced people were able to leave their shelters by early April. The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
50|$|The West Valley Demonstration Project Act (Public Law 96-368) {{was passed}} by the United States Congress in 1980, and {{directed}} the United States Department of Energy to lead the task of solidifying and removing the accumulated nuclear waste present on the site, in addition <b>to</b> <b>decontaminating</b> and decommissioning the facility and surrounding property. The processes used to solidify and contain the site's nuclear waste were intended to demonstrate strategies that could be used at other cleanup sites.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The problem being {{investigated}} {{was to develop}} an economical, environmentally friendly, and quality panel made from recycled plastics. The objective of this work was <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>decontaminating</b> the environment, and to solving the housing shortage in our country. The developed products were panels for housing and equipment. They were manufactured by recycling plastic materials from food, perfumery or cleaning packaging, waste production from factories due to failures in sheet thickness or ink application. It thus contributes <b>to</b> <b>decontaminating</b> the environment, since most of this waste is buried in municipal land without any use, or accumulated and burned in landfills, causing environmental degradation. The technical properties of these panels were established by laboratory testing. A comparison was made between their main technical properties and other conventional panels made with wood particles, available in the is panel does not swell under water, unlike conventional panels. The percentage of water absorption is {{lower than that of}} conventional panels. The flexural resistance is is almost equal to that of an uncoated particle board. The density is higher than that of conventional panels made with wood particles. The components obtained have environmental advantages with regard to other conventional ones, since they reduce plastic waste that causes pollution, instead of using up natural resources...|$|R

5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used <b>to</b> <b>decontaminate</b> munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company {{brought a}} case against Eastern Counties Leather in the High Court of Justice, wanting £1 million in damages {{for the cost of}} finding a new {{borehole}} and an unsuccessful attempt <b>to</b> <b>decontaminate</b> the original one, and an injunction to prevent any more use of PCE. They argued that Eastern Counties Leather were liable in three ways; first, in negligence, second, in nuisance, and third, under the rule developed in Rylands v Fletcher. The case came before Kennedy J, who dismissed all three of the Company's claims. On the matter of negligence, he held that the damage had to be reasonably foreseeable, as was required under Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd; he applied this same test to the claim under nuisance. Applying the case of Hughes v Lord Advocate, Kennedy found that the harm was not reasonably foreseeable, and both actions under nuisance and negligence must fail.|$|E
5|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{contracted}} with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) in 1997 <b>to</b> <b>decontaminate</b> and decommission the facilities. Its subsidiary Reactor Sites Management Company Limited (RSMC) {{was acquired by}} EnergySolutions in June 2007. Initially K-29, K-31 and K-33 were to be retained for other uses, but it was subsequently decided to demolish them. Bechtel Jacobs, the environmental management contractor, assumed responsibility for the facility in July 2005. Demolition of K-29 began in January 2006, and was completed in August. Demolition of K-33 began in January 2011, and was completed ahead of schedule in September 2011.

5|$|Though relegation to the Third Division {{meant the}} club was no longer bound by the Taylor Report's 1994 {{deadline}} for conversion to all-seater, new owner David Sullivan continued the £4.5million development as planned. After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished, helped by fans who took home a significant proportion as souvenirs, the land was cleared – the rubbish tip beneath the Kop which had earned the club £800 in 1906 (£ at 1994 prices) cost £250,000 <b>to</b> <b>decontaminate</b> – and {{by the start of}} the new season, 7,000 seats in the Tilton Road Stand were ready for use. On completion of the Kop Stand, the stadium was formally re-opened in November 1994 by Baroness Trumpington, representing the Department of National Heritage, who unveiled a commemorative plaque and presented a cheque for £2.5million on behalf of the Football Trust; the ceremony was followed by a friendly match against Aston Villa, attended by a crowd of 20,000. Planning permission for an all-seater Railway Stand was granted in March 1995, but work was delayed by a dispute over land owned by Railtrack and the stand opened only in 1999.|$|E

40|$|DOE needs <b>to</b> <b>de{{contaminated}}</b> {{over one}} {{million square feet of}} nuclear contaminated concrete surfaces. The 1000 lb ROVCO 2 system, which automates blasting functions and eliminates secondary blasting waste, integrates a remotely operated vehicle and an enhanced commercial CO{sub 2 } blasting system with an Oceaneering-developed work arm and control system. The remote operation protects the operation from contamination and supports functional automation of tedious tasks. The blasting system shoots pellets of dry ice propelled by pressurized gas at the surface to be cleaned. Impact of the pellets fractures and scales off a layer of the contaminated surface. At impact, the pellets return to a gaseous state which is vacuumed up with the debris. The CO{sub 2 } gas and debris are passed through the vacuum filter, leaving only the removed material for waste disposal. Phase 2 testing achieved nearly all of the success criteria, {{with the exception of the}} commercial workhead`s performance...|$|R
