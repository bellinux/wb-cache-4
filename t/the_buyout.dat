5|$|Several days later, Kravis, who had {{originally}} suggested {{the idea of}} <b>the</b> <b>buyout</b> to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>buyout</b> of RJR Nabisco was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during <b>the</b> <b>buyout</b> boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.|$|E

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} off-season, Cloutier's remaining year {{on his contract}} was bought out by the Kings on June 21, 2008. As teams cannot buyout the contract of an injured player, Cloutier claimed he was not healthy and contested the move.

Consequently, he received $2 {{million over the next}} two years from the Kings.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, {{together}} with Merrill Lynch and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $33.6 billion {{acquisition of the}} hospital company, making the company privately held again 17 years after it had first been taken private in a management <b>buyout.</b> At <b>the</b> time of its announcement, <b>the</b> HCA <b>buyout</b> was <b>the</b> first of several to set new records for the largest, eclipsing <b>the</b> 1989 <b>buyout</b> of RJR Nabisco.

5|$|In 2005, KKR was one {{of seven}} private equity firms {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>buyout</b> of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable {{given the number of}} firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.|$|E

Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien) tests Clark's abilities by setting off a bomb in his truck, while he is inside. Nixon confronts Clark in the Talon coffee shop, but Lex intervenes on Clark's behalf. Nixon follows Clark home and overhears a conversation about Clark's ship being in the storm cellar, and that Lex has the missing piece from the ship. Nixon goes to the Luthor mansion and steals the octagonal key, and immediately returns to the storm cellar with a video camera.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) has {{returned}} to his old job as regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch and announces that Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Ryan (B. J. Novak) have joined the sales team, retaining their old clients from the Michael Scott Paper Company. Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite <b>the</b> <b>buyout.</b> Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, to think of a way to get their clients back.|$|E

5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after <b>the</b> <b>buyout</b> and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that <b>the</b> <b>buyout</b> has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for <b>the</b> <b>buyout</b> of his USFL contract.|$|E

25|$|Buyout auction is {{an auction}} with an {{additional}} set price (the 'buyout' price) that any bidder can accept {{at any time during}} the auction, thereby immediately ending the auction and winning the item.

In a temporary-buyout auction the option to buy out the auction is not available after the first bid is placed.
