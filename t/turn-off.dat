5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the <b>turn-off</b> point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|A team {{composed}} of astronomers from France and Switzerland used the SOPHIE Ã©chelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to examine Kepler-40. SOPHIE uses radial velocity measurements to examine stars for exoplanets. After background light was removed and alternative causes for radial velocity variations were disproved (for example, that Kepler-40 {{was actually a}} close binary star), the team used SOPHIE to analyze {{the properties of the}} actual star. The astronomers observing the star found that it is nearing the main sequence <b>turn-off</b> (the star fuses the last of its hydrogen and becomes a red giant). The establishment of stellar parameters helped the astronomers extrapolate the exoplanet's parameters and prove the existence of Kepler-40b. The discovered planet was the sixth transiting planet to have been discovered in orbit around stars with a radius of more than 1.8 times that of the Sun, after planets including Kepler-5 and Kepler-7.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{construct}} and test measures of psychosocial mediators that could be used in intervention studies seeking to promote safer sex behavior among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). Methods: a total of 400 YBMSM, ages 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a clinic for sexually transmitted infection in the southern United States. All men had engaged in penile-anal sex with a man as a "top" in the past 6 months. The men completed an audio-computer-assisted self-interview and provided specimens used for nucleic acid amplification testing to detect Chlamydia and gonorrhea. Four measures were constructed and tested for criterion validity (Safer Sex Communication, Condom <b>Turn-Offs,</b> Condom Pleasure Scale, and a single item assessing frequency of condom use discussions before sexual arousal). Results: with the exception of Safer Sex Communication, all of the measures showed criterion validity for both unprotected anal insertive and unprotected anal receptive sex. With the exception of the Condom <b>Turn-Offs,</b> the 3 other measures were supported by criterion validity for oral sex. Both the Condom <b>Turn-Offs</b> and Condom Pleasure Scale were significantly related to whether or not the men reported multiple partners as a top, but only the Condom Pleasure Scale was associated with reports of multiple partners as a "bottom. " Only the Condom <b>Turn-Offs</b> Scale was positively associated with having been diagnosed with either Chlamydia or gonorrhea. Conclusion: findings provide 3 brief scales and a single item that can be used in intervention studies targeting YBMSM.

25|$|Most bipolar transistors, and {{especially}} power transistors, have long base-storage {{times when they}} are driven into saturation; the base storage limits <b>turn-off</b> time in switching applications.

40|$|Many {{intermediate}} age {{star clusters}} in the Magellanic Clouds present multiple main sequence <b>turn-offs</b> (MMSTO), which challenge the classical idea that star formation in such objects {{took place over}} short timescales. It has been recently suggested {{that the presence of}} fast rotators among main sequence stars could be the cause of such features (Bastian & de Mink 2009), hence relaxing the need for extended periods of star formation. In this letter, we compute evolutionary tracks and isochrones of models with and without rotation. We find that, for the same age and input physics, both kinds of models present <b>turn-offs</b> with an almost identical position in the colour-magnitude diagrams. As a consequence, a dispersion of rotational velocities in coeval ensembles of stars could not explain the presence of MMSTOs. We construct several synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams for the different kinds of tracks and combinations of them. The models that best reproduce the morphology of observed MMSTOs are clearly those assuming a significant spread in the stellar ages - as long as ~ 400 Myr - added to a moderate amount of convective core overshooting. Only these models produce the detailed "golf club" shape of observed MMSTOs. A spread in rotational velocities alone cannot do anything similar. We also discuss models involving a mixture of stars with and without overshooting, as an additional scenario to producing MMSTOs with coeval populations. We find that they produce <b>turn-offs</b> with a varying extension in the CMD direction perpendicular to the lower main sequence, which are clearly not present in observed MMSTOs.

25|$|The {{two most}} viable {{explanations}} put forth {{for the existence}} of blue stragglers both involve interactions between cluster members. One explanation is that they are current or former binary stars that {{are in the process of}} merging or have already done so. The merger of two stars would create a single more massive star, potentially with a mass larger than that of stars at the main-sequence <b>turn-off</b> point. While a star born with a mass larger than that of stars at the <b>turn-off</b> point would have already evolved off of the main sequence, a more massive star which formed via merger would not have evolved as quickly. There is evidence in favor of this view, notably that blue stragglers appear to be much more common in dense regions of clusters, especially in the cores of globular clusters. Since there are more stars per unit volume, collisions and close encounters are far more likely in clusters than among field stars and calculations of the expected number of collisions are consistent with the observed number of blue stragglers.|$|E

25|$|Because {{thyristors}} {{can only}} be turned on (not off) by control action, and rely on the external AC system to effect the <b>turn-off</b> process, the control system only has one degree of freedom â when {{to turn on the}} thyristor.
