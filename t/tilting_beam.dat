40|$|Abstract: <b>Tilt</b> <b>beam</b> {{characteristic}} {{by changing}} the length of finite-sized square dielectric substrate of one arm rectangular spiral antenna has been investigated. Rectangular spiral is printed on a finite sized dielectric substrate (εr= 3. 27) backed by a finite-sized conducting plane. Rectangular spiral radiates in Right Handed Circular Polarization (RHCP). Horizontal spiral arm length (HL) is varied from HL= 0. 8 λo to HL= 5. 2 λo to choose the length that yields the proper axial ratio and gain. HL is chosen to be three values: HL 1 = 1. 16 λo, HL 2 = 2. 63 λo and HL 3 = 4. 64 λo. HL 1 radiates axial beam whereas HL 2 and HL 3 radiates <b>tilt</b> <b>beams.</b> By changing square dielectric substrate length (SL), maximum beam direction on the elevation angle has been tilted more to the higher elevation angle with HL 2 and HL 3 fixed. Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) in the elevation angle when Φ = maximum gain direction of RHCP is decreased by increasing square dielectric ubstrate length. s Introduction: Spiral antenna was previously investigated [1 - 3].

40|$|The laser {{interferometer}} space antenna (LISA) is a future space-based interferometric gravitational-wave detector consisting of three spacecraft in a triangular configuration. The interferometric measurements of path length changes between satellites {{will be performed}} on optical benches in the satellites. Angular misalignments of the interfering beams couple into the length measurement and represent a significant noise source. Imaging systems {{will be used to}} reduce this tilt-to-length coupling. We designed and constructed an optical test bed to experimentally investigate tilt-to-length coupling. It consists of two separate structures, a minimal optical bench and a telescope simulator. The minimal optical bench comprises the science interferometer where the local laser is interfered with light from a remote spacecraft. In our experiment, a simulated version of this received beam is generated on the telescope simulator. The telescope simulator provides a <b>tilting</b> <b>beam,</b> a reference interferometer and an additional static beam as a phase reference.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} imaging {{at multiple}} length scales {{is of great}} importance in biological research [4]. Conventional electron tomography addresses the length scale of 50 [mu]m³ to 50 [mu]m³, which lies between X-ray crystallography and light microscopy. A desirable technological advance is the scaling up of electron tomography to address large volumes {{on the order of}} 0. 5 mm³ at high resolution, and a major challenge in achieving such large scale reconstructions is reducing the time of acquisition. Electron tomography is typically a slow and tedious process. Recent advances in automated data acquisition using predictions of stage movement have lead to significant improvement [14] in acquisition speed. However, for very large scale high resolution imaging projects such as serial section tomography applied to brain circuit reconstruction [2], faster tomographic acquisition systems will be necessary. In this work, a new conical electron beam control system was designed and tested on the following 3 D imaging applications: high speed tomographic data acquisition without need for specimen tilt, enhancement of single axis tilt tomography with additional beam tilting, and object precession. Since tilting the beam requires only modification of current to deflection coils, the speed of beam tilt far exceeds mechanical <b>tilting.</b> <b>Beam</b> deflection also gives higher precision of changes in angle than mechanical tilt.
