5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. <b>The</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly did {{not enjoy}} his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of {{practical}} training and <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical theory. Regarding it as a waste of time, he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O'Reilly regarded as incompetent.|$|E

5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve {{traces of the}} reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments used in the eggs of many modern birds. The eggs were most likely an intense blue-green color, as shown by <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Huns {{destroyed}} Drobeta and Sucidava in the 440s, but the forts were restored under Emperor Justinian I (527565). Eastern Roman coins {{from the}} first half of the 6thcentury suggest a significant military presence in Olteniaa region also characterized by <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> pottery with shapes of Roman tradition. Although Eastern Roman emperors made annual payments to the neighboring peoples in an attempt to keep the peace in the Balkans, the Avars regularly invaded Scythia Minor from the 580s. The Romans abandoned Sucidava in 596 or 597, but Tomis, which was the last town in Scythia Minor to resist the invaders, only fell in 704.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

5|$|Since only castles {{built of}} stone and walled towns {{had been able to}} resist Mongol attacks, {{following}} the withdrawal of the Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Unguraş. The process of urbanization was characterized by <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city-like way of life of its inhabitants.

5|$|Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) {{are located}} {{close to the}} banks of the Irwell, near to its {{confluence}} with the River Croal at Moses Gate Country Park near Bolton. The first is at Nob End, a 88 800 m² site which has been designated because of its biological interest, based on <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids. Nob End is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The second site is Ashclough, which is a site of geological interest. These two SSSIs are among the 21 found in Greater Manchester. In Salford the river flows through Clifton Country Park and Kersal Dale Country Park, both of which have been designated as LNRs.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E

30|$|Linking up {{the three}} {{principles}} – ‘anti-communism’, ‘authoritarian state’ and ‘economic growth’ – {{played a key}} role in the understanding of South Korean society from the 1960 s until the 1980 s, and its consequences also marked the later period. On the one hand, anti-communism was an indispensable support for the dictatorship and created <b>the</b> absolute <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state over civil society. On the other hand, in the context of the ideology of growth anti-communism guaranteed <b>the</b> absolute <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> capital over labour.

5|$|Conflict {{between the}} two rivals was renewed in 948, when Mu'izz al-Dawla again marched against Mosul, but was forced to cut off his {{campaign}} to assist his brother Rukn al-Dawla, who was having trouble in Persia. In exchange, Nasir al-Dawla agreed to recommence the payment of tribute for the Jazira and Syria, {{as well as to}} add the names of the three Buyid brothers after that of the Caliph in the Friday prayer. Another round of warfare erupted in 956–958. While the Buyids were preoccupied with the rebellion of their Daylamite troops under Rezbahan ibn Vindadh-Khurshid in southern Iraq, Nasir al-Dawla the opportunity to advance south and capture Baghdad. After the suppression of the Daylamite revolt, however, the Hamdanids were not able to maintain their position {{in the face of the}} Buiyd counteroffensive, and abandoned the city. Peace was renewed in exchange for the recommencement of tribute and an additional indemnity, but when Nasir al-Dawla refused to send the second year's payment, the Buyid ruler advanced north. Unable to confront the Buyid army in the field, Nasir al-Dawla abandoned Mosul and fled to Mayyafariqin and then to his brother Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo. The Buyids captured Mosul and Nasibin, but the Hamdanids and their supporters withdrew to their home territory in the mountains of the north, taking with them their treasures as well as all government records and tax registers. As a result, the Buyid army was unable to support itself in the conquered territory, all the more since the predominantly Daylamite troops were resented by the local people, who launched guerrilla attacks on them. Sayf al-Dawla tried to mediate with Mu'izz al-Dawla, but his first approaches were rebuffed. Only when he agreed to assume the burden of paying his brother's tribute for the entire Diyar Rabi'a, did the Buyid ruler agree to peace. This agreement marks the reversal of roles {{between the two}} Hamdanid brothers, and the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> the family's Syrian branch.|$|E
