The Quraish, however, {{did not succeed}} in killing Muhammad, nor did they occupy the town of Medina, {{possibly}} because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was guarded by Ibn Ubayy.

25|$|Milwaukee's {{founding}} fathers {{had a vision}} for the city: <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new immigrants who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin {{during the middle of the}} 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.|$|E

They are drawn back by the power of Susan's horn, blown by Prince Caspian to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia, as <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> is no more, as 1,300 years have passed and their castle is in ruins, while all Narnians have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan's magic can wake them. Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, Miraz, who has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.|$|E

500|$|Developmental {{psychologist}} Jean Piaget conducted {{experiments that}} collected behavioral tests on infants. Piaget studied object permanence by observing infants' reactions when a favorite object or toy was presented {{and then was}} covered with a blanket or removed from sight. Object permanence is considered {{to be one of the}} earliest methods for evaluating working memory. [...] An infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused. Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had [...] ceased to exist. Reactions of most infants that had already started developing object permanence were of frustration because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> existed, but didn't know where it was. However, the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing object permanence was more oblivious. If an infant searched for the object, it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm With Cupid" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. Because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would air on Valentine's Day, Fox asked the Simpsons staff to produce an episode related to the holiday. The episode's ending credits were also painted red {{in honor of the}} holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney, who also wrote the episode's first draft. The episode's title was pitched by fellow Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who based it on the popular T-shirt slogan I'm with stupid. However, Hauge later found out that the title had already been used before for an episode of another television series. However, he did not believe that copyright issues would arise: [...] "It's a very innocent mistake," [...] Hauge said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It {{is one of those things}} that, in the course of a career, you're gonna be on both sides of that, so nobody ever sues on it." ...|$|E

[...] In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper Dagen two days following the band's safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band's gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: [...] "We're now twice as big in Brazil as we were before we went there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Powell and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just means {{we have a little}} more of a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E

2500|$|On June 18, Baton Rouge {{refinery}} representatives {{told the}} LDEQ that ExxonMobil's chemical team {{determined that the}} June 14 spill was actually a level 2 incident classification which means that a significant response to the leak was required. On {{the day of the}} spill the refinery did not report that their estimate of spilled materials was significantly different from what was originally reported to the department. Because the spill estimate and the actual amount of chemicals spilled varied drastically, the LDEQ launched an in-depth investigation on June 16 to determine the actual amounts of chemicals spilled as well as to find out what information the refinery knew and when <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> [...] On June 20, ExxonMobil sent an official notification to the LDEQ saying that the leak had actually released 28,688 pounds of benzene, 10,882 pounds of toluene, 1,100 pounds of cyclohexane, 1,564 pounds of hexane and 12,605 pounds of additional volatile organic compound.

2500|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} in Regina, Saskatchewan in February 2009 at 3 different grocery stores located in 3 different regions that had the same median income before taxes of around $30,000. [...] Of the 211 respondents to the study, most were women who purchased most of the food for their household. When asked how they decide what food to buy, the most important factors were price, nutritional value, and need. When looking at the nutritional facts, however, they indicated that they looked at the ingredients, and neglected {{to pay attention to the}} amount of trans fat. This means that trans fat is not on their minds unless they are specifically told of it. When asked if they ever heard about trans fat, 98% said, [...] "Yes." [...] However, only 27% said that it was unhealthy. Also, 79% said that they only knew a little about trans fats, and could have been more educated. Respondents aged 41â€“60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern, compared to ages 18â€“40. When asked if they would stop buying their favorite snacks if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> contained trans fat, most said they would continue purchasing it, especially the younger respondents. Also, of the respondents that called trans fat a major concern, 56% of them still wouldn't change their diet to non-trans fat snacks. This is because taste and food gratification take precedence over perceived risk to health. [...] "The consumption of trans fats and the associated increased risk of CHD is a public health concern regardless of age and socioeconomic status".|$|E
2500|$|Paris City {{officials}} had {{announced plans to}} greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading [...] "Paris defends human rights throughout the world" [...] to the City Hall, {{in an attempt to}} promote values [...] "of all humanity and of human rights." [...] Members from Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests, including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand over to Teddy Riner: [...] "I understand they're afraid of everything, but this is just annoying. They extinguished the flame despite {{the fact that there was}} no risk, and they could see it and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> I don't know why they did it." ...|$|E
