40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the European air {{transport}} industry {{has undergone a}} process in several stages of transition towards a single market. Liberalization has been {{closely linked to the}} effective application of the state aid rules of the EC Treaty. In principle, direct <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> undertakings within the common market is not prohibited by the state aid rules in the Treaty. However, aid granted by Member States that distorts or threatens to distort competition by giving one airline an unfair advantage over its competitors, and in so far as it affects trade between Member States, is incompatible with the Treaty. Certain mandatory or discretionary exemptions may <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> airlines providing that the measure fulfills the conditions and requirements as stated by the Treaty. The European Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority have a wide discretion in deciding whether or not certain aid measures fall within the stated exemptions. Where the market forces alone are not able to achieve the desired results or if they are only able to do so in a limited capacity, such exemptions may be warranted to the extent not contrary to the common interest. A special mechanism is in place to ensure that state aid is properly scrutinized {{in the light of the}} demands of the Treaty and the EEA Agreement.

40|$|Governments are the {{custodians}} of {{vast amount}} of data. While some of this data may be sensitive in nature, in that it contains personal or confidential information, {{much of it is}} in the public interest. Recent years has seen the emergence of Open Government Data (OGD) where governments are now actively making their data available in open and electronically accessible formats. The motivation for the production of such data includes a desire to increase transparency but also a desire to realise the economic potential associated with re-use of this data. A key usage area for this data to date has been within mobile applications where raw OGD is transformed into a consumable product. Making data available for re-use in this context introduces the concept of data quality in that the OGD being released must be of sufficient quality to allow for re-use by application developers. This dissertation proposes a set of quality guidelines <b>to</b> be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> OGD <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> its utility within mobile application development. The guidelines are derived from an assessment of Irish produced OGD. Existing data quality literature indicates that data quality can be assessed at both an objective and subjective level. This research adopts this proposal, objectively assessing OGD data quality through an impartial assessment of the data. It also subjectively assesses the quality of OGD through it utilisation within an experimental mobile application developed on the Android platform. The resulting assessment findings are interpreted to produce a set of OGD quality guidelines...|$|R

To the duke, therefore, she applied in this moment of sudden calamity, imploring him to furnish succor to her husband. The event showed how well noble spirits understand each other. No sooner did the duke receive this appeal from the wife of his enemy than he generously forgot all feeling of animosity and determined to go in person to his succor. He immediately despatched a courteous letter to the marchioness, assuring her that in consideration of the request of so honorable and estimable a lady, and to rescue from peril so valiant a cavalier as her husband, whose loss would be great, not only to Spain, but to all Christendom, he would forego the recollection of all past grievances, and hasten to his relief with all the forces he could raise.|$|R
40|$|Ship large-power {{steam boiler}} {{may serve as}} an example of complex {{critical}} technical system. A basis for rational control of operation of such system is knowledge on its capability of fulfilling the tasks to which it was intended. In order to make it possible <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> computer <b>aiding</b> <b>to</b> operational decision-making the capability should be described analytically. In this paper it was proposed to express the capability of ship steam boiler (considered a complex system) to perform service tasks, by calculating components of its usability potential in a given instant t. To this end, was distinguished a set of steam boiler fundamental features which formulate space of its technical states. Values and characteristic intervals of the features were defined and this way sub-spaces of serviceability and non-serviceability states of the object in question were determined. Next, in the considered space, technical state of the boiler and its usability potential was determined. Owing to this it become possible to quantitatively express the steam boiler functioning capability which served as a basis for elaborating an algorithm for controlling the operational processes of a complex technical system under action. In this paper is also described a way of application of the presented method to calculation of ship steam boiler usability potential, which may be especially instrumental in the case of operational control of the boilers of the kind, equipped with interstage reheaters, i. e. those operating with high values of operational parameters...|$|R

Chemometric applications including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 2 D correlation and multivariate curve resolution techniques have been <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> data <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> in interpretation and classify samples based on similarities and differences in formulations. The composition of mineral and traditional-based foundation powders {{was found to be}} quite different. Traditional formulations comprised of talc and, in some cases, calcium carbonate, while mineral-based samples contained larger amounts of mica. Some samples, denoted by their producers as mineral samples, were subsequently classified as traditional as they contained talc in their formulations. 2 D correlation applied across two spectroscopic methods highlights positive correlating spectral features between techniques. Elemental concentrations produced through XRF analysis, were correlated with XRD data. In this manner XRF data successfully aided the interpretation of XRD data and confirmed components that could be represented by a single element in their component phases, in particular, zinc oxide, bismuth oxychloride and titanium dioxide. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) analysis of samples in the mid and near infrared regions provided information on the structural and chemical composition of foundation samples. Correlation of XRD data and spectral data in the mid-infrared region confirmed the presence of talc, kaolin, calcium carbonate and mica in samples. 2 In general, mineral-based samples could be discriminated based on manufacturer, but traditional-based samples could not. The techniques and data analysis methods developed and applied here could be of benefit to the analysis of other complex, solid samples...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{number of}} life and health {{threatening}} emergency events causes significant financial and environmental damage. With their large range and destructiveness these events compel an effective communication of the available rescue capacities. This increase was the crucial moment for commencement of a development of such system which would join all the necessary establishments predetermined for dealing with a specific emergency situation and concurrently which would become an effective tool for its handling. Such system nowadays is the Joint Rescue Service. The basic establishments within the Joint Rescue Service are the Fire Brigade of the Czech Republic, the Medical Rescue Service and Police of the Czech Republic. Mutual collaboration during actions is co-ordinated and requires permanent co-operation, especially when securing personal safety of rescue groups of the Fire Brigade and Police. It is beneficial when members of these establishments are educated {{in the area of}} first aid application as also during the actions lives of these people are often threatened and only the immediate first aid in place may be the crucial prognostic factor. The objective of my Bachelor Thesis was to map the knowledge of first aid application at the basic emergency establishments within the Joint Rescue (Police of the Czech Republic and the Fire Brigade of the Czech Republic). The research group consisted of members of police and fire brigade of the South Bohemian Region. Data collection was in form of a questionnaire provided to be filled in. I distributed the questionnaires personally as I wanted to discuss the relevant topic with the police and fire brigade members and to know their opinion. The research proved that both the members of the Fire Brigade and Police of the Czech Republic are very well prepared in terms of the theory of first <b>aid</b> application <b>to</b> an injured person. The established system of education of policemen and fire brigade men rescuing people in need of first aid is probably functional and provides policemen and fire brigade men with enough information on fist aid basics. Although policemen have less practical experience {{it does not mean that}} they would not be able <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> first <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> an injured person.

Hugh Roger Littlepage, {{both got}} a little how-come-you-so, {{drinking}} bumpers {{to the success of}} what they called [...] "the Yankee expedition," [...] even at the moment they were indulging in constant side hits at the failings and habits of the people. These marks of neighbourly infirmity are not peculiar {{to the people of the}} adjacent provinces of New York and of New England. I have often remarked that the English think and talk very much of the French, as the Yankees speak of us; while the French, so far as I have been able to understand their somewhat unintelligible language--which seems never to have a beginning nor an end--treat the English as the Puritans of the Old World. As I have already intimated, we were not very remarkable for religion in New York, in my younger days; while it would be just the word, were I to say that religion was conspicuous among our eastern neighbours. I remember to have heard my grandfather say, he was once acquainted with a Col. Heathcote, an Englishman, like himself, by birth, and a brother of a certain Sir Gilbert Heathcote, who was formerly a leading man in the Bank of England. This Col. Heathcote came among us young, and married here, leaving his posterity behind him, and was lord of the manor of Scarsdale and Mamaroneck, in our county of West Chester. Well, this Col. Heathcote told my grandfather, speaking on the subject of religion, that he had been much shocked, on arriving in this country, at discovering the neglected condition of religion in the colony; more especially on Long Island, where the people lived in a sort of heathenish condition. Being a man of mark, and connected with the government, The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> it in spreading the truths of the bible in the colony. The Colonel was glad enough to comply; and I remember my grandfather said, his friend told him of the answer he returned to these good persons in England. [...] "I was so struck with the heathenish condition of the people, on my arriving here," [...] he wrote to them, [...] "that, commanding the militia of the colony, I ordered the captains of the different companies to call their men together, each Sunday at sunrise, and to drill them until sunset; unless they would consent to repair to some convenient place, and listen to morning and evening prayer, and to two wholesome sermons read by some suitable person, in which case the men were to be excused from drill." [...] [2] I do not think this would be found necessary in New England at least, where many of the people would be likely to prefer drilling to preaching.|$|R
