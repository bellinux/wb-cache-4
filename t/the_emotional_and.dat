5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{films have}} their own {{particular}} meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.|$|E

Data were gathered from 342 employees working in state and private banks. Relationships between the variables, significant relationships between <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> competence dimensions <b>and</b> performance dimensions were observed in this study. No relationship was observed between the “guilty” dimension of <b>emotional</b> competence <b>and</b> task performance. Non-hierarchical cluster analysis was selected and K-means cluster analysis was performed to determine <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> competence levels of participant banking professionals. <b>The</b> seven pre-specified <b>emotional</b> competences were classified by using Ward’s method. Cluster analysis revealed that <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> competences of <b>the</b> participants were clustered in two groups as high and low. Regression analyses revealed insignificant relationships between <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> competence <b>and</b> task performance of employees, but positive significant relationships between <b>emotional</b> competence <b>and</b> contextual performance. Significant differences were also observed in <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> competence levels <b>and</b> task-contextual performances of employees. In other words, individuals with high emotional competence levels also exhibited high performances...|$|R

25|$|The trilogy {{describes}} the day-to-day problems of adaptation and survival and <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> social trauma of losing {{connection with the}} modern world.

Some Nantucket residents wish to dominate the world for their own benefit, others wish to interact with local populations through trade and cultural development, while most just want to survive, work hard, and claw {{their way back to}} something approaching their pre-Event way of life.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{relation}} between the novel's two main characters, Anyanwu and Doro, may be said to comment on aspects of the slave trade. Anyanwu is coerced out of her home and transported to the Americas to breed offspring on Doro's behalf. Thus, Doro has been interpreted as symbolizing the control exercised over place and sexuality in the slave trade and Anyanwu as symbolizing the colonized and dominated native populations. Anyanwu's conflicts with Doro also illustrate <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> psychological consequences of slavery and the possibilities of slave agency in Anyanwu's resistance to Doro's control.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} the {{peculiar}} mood and appearance of Parade, art historian John Russell has proposed a literary inspiration, {{as opposed to a}} political or scientific basis; citing Arthur Rimbaud's poem a La parade, published in the Symbolist review La vogue, 13 May 1886. It had long been believed that Charles Henry's theories on <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> symbolic expression of lines, shapes and colors were at the root of Parade. Though, it wasn't until the 1890 exhibition of Le Chahut (two year after the completion of Parade) that critics remarked on a connection between the work of Seurat and the theories of Henry.|$|E
25|$|An {{empirical}} research {{was done by}} Katholiki Georgiades, Michael H. Boyle, and Kelly A. Fife over <b>the</b> <b>Emotional</b> <b>and</b> Behavior Problems Among Adolescent Students, in specific immigrant students. They {{examined the relationship between}} immigrants and racial/ethnic congruence in school. They hypothesized that school belonging is the connection between the congruency and the emotional problems. Although their study was unable to find enough evidence to support their hypothesis they agree that school belonging will influence emotional behavioral problems. According to other studies, TCKs are proven to have less emotional stability than those who grew up in more culturally and socially stable environment.|$|E
25|$|While fascism {{accepted}} {{the importance of}} material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both communism and capitalism and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement {{of the role of}} the spirit. In particular, fascists criticized capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged indifference to the nation. Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> spiritual bonds of the nation and a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.|$|E

His 2000 work Tokyo Trash Baby is an understated look at a lonely woman who goes through the garbage of the neighbor she is obsessed with looking for mementos. His other film in 2000 had a very different theme; the erotic comic drama I Am an S Writer, with a screenplay by Hiroki's former pink film colleague Hitoshi Ishikawa, is based on a possibly partly autobiographical novel by celebrated S writer Oniroku Dan.|$|E
25|$|Enslaved {{women on}} {{plantations}} were often {{given the same}} work as men. Slaveholders often put slave women to work alongside men in the grueling atmosphere of the fields but were aware of ways to exploit them with regards to their gender as well. Choosing between the two was regularly a matter of expediency for the owners. In both small and large estates women were heavily involved in fieldwork, {{and the chance to}} be exempted in favor of domestic work was a privilege. Their roles in reproduction were still emphasized by owners, but often childbirth only meant that the physical demands of the field were forced to coexist with <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> physical pull of parenthood.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} examining {{the correlation between}} <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> regulation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subjective welfare in teenagers.

The subjects in this research were the students of class XII of SMA Negeri 1 Wonosari Klaten. The technique of sampling used was the method of cluster sampling, from all classes XII, the researcher drew at random and obtained samples of class XII IPA 1, XII IPA 4, XII IPS 3. The scales used were <b>the</b> scale of <b>emotional</b> regulation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scale of subjective welfare. The technique of data analysis used in this research was the technique of the Pearson product moment correlation to test the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> regulation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subjective welfare in the teenagers. The Pearson product moment correlation showed coefficient as much as 0. 350 with p = 0. 001 (p < 0. 005) that meant that there was a positively significant correlation between <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> regulation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subjective welfare of the teenagers. Therefore, the hypothesis of the research was accepted. Coefficient of the determination (r²) was as much as 0. 123, therefore, the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>emotional</b> regulation on <b>the</b> subjective welfare was as much as 12. 3...|$|R
