5|$|Taken from OpenBSD, the OpenSSH {{program was}} {{included}} in default install. OpenSSH is a Free implementation of the SSH protocol and is a replacement for <b>telnet.</b> Unlike <b>telnet,</b> OpenSSH encrypts all information (including username and password).|$|E
25|$|Most modern BBSes allow <b>telnet</b> access {{over the}} Internet using a <b>telnet</b> server and a virtual FOSSIL driver.|$|E
25|$|Today, most BBS {{software}} {{that is still}} actively supported, such as Worldgroup, Wildcat! BBS and Citadel/UX, is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or DOSBox (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to <b>telnet,</b> allowing them to connect to <b>Telnet</b> BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem terminal emulation software, like Telix, Terminate, Qmodem and Procomm Plus. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and SyncTerm include native <b>telnet</b> support.|$|E

50|$|David Holdsworth and Delwyn Holroyd {{obtained}} {{copies of}} George 3 issue tapes {{when the last}} live site in the UK, at British Steel Corporation, was being decommissioned and wrote an emulator for the 1900 hardware and executive that allows running of George on Microsoft Windows and Linux {{as part of a}} project for the Computer Conservation Society. The emulator includes an emulation of Executive and a Java emulation of an ICL7903 Communications Processor making it possible to run MOP sessions by <b>telnetting</b> to (in this case) port 2023.|$|R
25|$|Support for 5250 display {{operations}} is provided via display files, an interface between workstations, keyboards and displays, and interactive applications, {{as opposed to}} batch processing {{with little or no}} user interaction. ASCII terminals and PC workstations are equally and well supported, also via internet or LAN network access supplemented by either IBM or non-IBM communication software, for example <b>TELNET</b> or <b>TELNET</b> 5250.|$|E

25|$|Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as FrontDoor, Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge {{from the}} early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the {{freeware}} NetFoss <b>Telnet</b> FOSSIL driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to dial an IP address or hostname via <b>Telnet,</b> rather than dialing a real POTS phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with DOSEMU (DOS emulator).|$|E
5000|$|In April 2005, Tridgell {{tried to}} produce free {{software}} (now known as SourcePuller) that interoperated with the BitKeeper source code repository. This was {{cited as the}} reason that BitMover revoked a license allowing Linux developers free use of their BitKeeper product. Linus Torvalds, {{the creator of the}} Linux kernel, and Tridgell were thus involved in a public debate about the events, in which Tridgell stated that, not having bought or owned BitKeeper - and thus having never agreed to its license - he could not violate it, and was analyzing the protocol ethically, as he had done with Samba. Tridgell's involvement in the project resulted in Torvalds accusing him of playing dirty tricks with BitKeeper. Tridgell claimed his analysis started with simply <b>telneting</b> to a BitKeeper server and typing [...]|$|R
40|$|Once attackers have {{penetrated}} a system, {{they will}} usually {{take advantage of}} their position by extending their reach to compromise other systems (e. g., by sniffing passwords from the network), and by installing "back doors" that will enable them to regain access even if the original insecurity is repaired. A common approach is to install a modified version of a standard system daemon such as <b>telnetd.</b> It is also common for attackers to attempt to cover their tracks by installing doctored versions of standard programs like ls, ps and sum. Programs like this, which conceal something harmful inside a harmless looking exterior, are called Trojan Horses. CryptoMark detects Trojan Horses as they are about to be activated. It is similar in its goals to Kim and Spafford's Tripwire, but detects intrusions with lower latency. That is, rather than laying dormant until the system administrator next runs a Tripwire integrity check, CryptoMark would detect a Trojan Horse as soon as it is run. Another [...] ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 90's, the sheer {{quantity}} of DNS data was overwhelming the tools available to manage it. The cost {{of managing the}} data instigated the birth of DNS management software. The costs can best be explained by illustration. In 1998, three of the largest web hosting companies (HostPro, Interland, and Vservers) each hosted about 100,000 DNS zones. DNS changes were made by <b>telnetting</b> to a BIND master and editing zone files with a text editor. A staff of several DNS admins performed this task all day, every day. Their changes would only take effect after a BIND reload. Because disks were slow, it took several hours for BIND to do a full reload. If a DNS admin made a typo in a zone file, BIND would fail to parse that file and die. Often after hours of processing. Whomever noticed BIND wasn't running would {{have to read the}} logs, find the zone file with the error, manually review the file, fix the error, and then try starting BIND back up. Once up, the changes could propagate to the DNS slaves via zone transfers. Changes often took more than 24 hours to fully propagate.|$|R
25|$|Mosaic {{is based}} on the libwww library and thus {{supported}} a wide variety of Internet protocols included in the library: Archie, FTP, gopher, HTTP, NNTP, <b>telnet,</b> WAIS.|$|E
25|$|Old {{protocols}} {{and technologies}} removed: Gopher, <b>TELNET,</b> Scriptlets, DirectAnimation, XBM, Channels (.CDF files) {{also known as}} 'Active Desktop Items', etc. The DHTML Editing Control is being removed from IE7 for Windows Vista to reduce surface area for security attacks.|$|E
25|$|The bytes 0xFE and 0xFF do not appear, so a valid UTF-8 stream never {{matches the}} UTF-16 byte order mark and thus cannot be {{confused}} with it. The absence of 0xFF (0377) also eliminates the need to escape this byte in <b>Telnet</b> (and FTP control connection).|$|E
5000|$|The {{leaders of}} this {{emerging}} phenomenon gave themselves imaginative titles, {{a bit of}} whimsy that set a wacky, free-flying tone for company atmosphere and morale. Frank Daniels III was LHP, for [...] "Lord High Protector." [...] George Schlukbier was CBGL, for [...] "Chief Bull Goose Looney." [...] Employees followed suit with their own job titles. As in other internet start-up companies, there was frenzied activity 24-hours a day, seven days a week. A company lore evolved, with numerous stories {{such as the one}} about installing system upgrades and dropping dial-up customers by the rack. Even the FBI were regular players. During the period when Kevin Mitnick was America's most-wanted computer hacker (1994-1995) he was living in Raleigh and using cell phones to hack into ISP's and then <b>telneting</b> into unsuspecting UNIX servers (like Nando) and creating directories/files and deleting all traces. Nando technicians tried, but never quite managed, to get a fix on Mitnick's location. All the while, the company was in communication with the FBI. In fact, it was required {{to be in touch with}} the FBI. During this period, increasingly computer-savvy young people were starting to figure out the holes in Unix. Life was changing at Nando.|$|R
25|$|There is now (~2014) a retro {{movement}} {{which is}} {{resulting in a}} slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. <b>Telnet,</b> Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can <b>telnet</b> to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and internet mail has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access this better than {{the internet as a}} whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with ASCII text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their internet mail and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.|$|E
25|$|PCBoard also {{supports}} ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and <b>Telnet</b> access via the Internet. The open source terminal emulator SyncTERM, available for Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X {{can be used}} for example to connect to the few remaining PCBoard BBS installations that are connected to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Berkeley's Unix was {{the first}} Unix to include {{libraries}} supporting the Internet Protocol stacks: Berkeley sockets. A Unix implementation of IP's predecessor, the ARPAnet's NCP, with FTP and <b>Telnet</b> clients, had been produced at U. Illinois in 1975, and was available at Berkeley. However, the memory scarcity on the PDP-11 forced a complicated design and performance problems.|$|E
25|$|For many years, {{the library}} used the Computerized Information Network for Cincinnati and Hamilton County (CINCH) as a {{system-wide}} library catalog which connected each branch through computer terminals. Users at home accessed the database via <b>TELNET.</b> In 2005, {{the system was}} replaced with an integrated library system (ILS) purchased from library automation vendor Sirsi, now SirsiDynix.|$|E
25|$|Most MUDs are run as hobbies and {{are free}} to players; some may accept {{donations}} or allow players to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed via standard <b>telnet</b> clients, or specialized MUD clients which are designed to improve the user experience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector.|$|E
25|$|Fuzzball routers {{were the}} first modern routers on the Internet. They were DEC LSI-11 {{computers}} loaded with router software. First conceptualized by its inventor, David L. Mills, fuzzball routers evolved as a virtual machine supporting the DEC RT-11 operating system and early developmental versions of the TCP/IP protocol and applications suite. Prototype versions of popular Internet tools, including <b>Telnet,</b> FTP, DNS, EGP and SMTP were first implemented and tested on fuzzball routers.|$|E
25|$|The default GUI {{is based}} on Be API on BeOS, Cocoa for macOS, and Qt 4 for Linux and Windows, but all give a similar {{standard}} interface. The old default GUI was based on wxWidgets on Linux and Windows. VLC supports highly customizable skins through the skins2 interface, and also supports Winamp 2 and XMMS skins. Skins are not supported in the macOS version. VLC has ncurses, remote control, and <b>telnet</b> console interfaces. There is also an HTTP interface, as well as interfaces for mouse gestures and keyboard hotkeys.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the session}} and {{presentation}} {{layers of the}} OSI suite {{are considered to be}} included to the application layer of the TCP/IP suite. The functionality of the session layer can be found in protocols like HTTP and SMTP and is more evident in protocols like <b>Telnet</b> and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Session layer functionality is also realized with the port numbering of the TCP and UDP protocols, which cover the transport layer in the TCP/IP suite. Functions of the presentation layer are realized in the TCP/IP applications with the MIME standard in data exchange.|$|E
25|$|By 1995, {{many of the}} DOS-based BBSes {{had begun}} {{switching}} to modern multitasking operating systems, such as OS/2, Windows 95, and Linux. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was Excalibur BBS with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led {{to one of the}} earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as Synchronet, Mystic BBS, EleBBS, DOC or Wildcat! BBS, provide access using the <b>Telnet</b> protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a FOSSIL-to-Telnet redirector such as NetFoss.|$|E
25|$|Application layer {{protocols}} generally {{treat the}} transport layer (and lower) protocols as black boxes which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate, although the applications are usually aware of key {{qualities of the}} transport layer connection such as the end point IP addresses and port numbers. Application layer protocols are often associated with particular client-server applications, and common services have well-known port numbers reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses server port 80 and <b>Telnet</b> uses server port 23. Clients connecting to a service usually use ephemeral ports, i.e., port numbers assigned only {{for the duration of}} the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of inexpensive dial-up internet {{service and the}} Mosaic web browser offered ease of use and global access that BBS and online systems did not provide, {{and led to a}} rapid crash in the market starting in 1994. Over the next year, many of the leading BBS software providers went bankrupt {{and tens of thousands of}} BBSes disappeared. Today, BBSing survives largely as a nostalgic hobby in most parts of the world, but it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see PTT Bulletin Board System) and in China. Most BBSes are now accessible over <b>Telnet</b> and typically offer free email accounts, FTP services, IRC and all of the protocols commonly used on the Internet. Some offer access through packet switched networks or packet radio connections.|$|E
25|$|Network {{services}} include offerings such as file sharing, print services, email, web sites, {{and file}} transfer protocols (FTP), {{most of which}} can have compromised security. At {{the front line of}} security are hardware devices known as firewalls or intrusion detection/prevention systems. At the operating system level, {{there are a number of}} software firewalls available, as well as intrusion detection/prevention systems. Most modern operating systems include a software firewall, which is enabled by default. A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating system. Therefore, one can install and be running an insecure service, such as <b>Telnet</b> or FTP, and not have to be threatened by a security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on that port.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 {{was used}} to run {{bulletin}} board systems using software packages such as Bizarre 64, Blue Board, C-Net, Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the <b>Telnet</b> protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought by America Online), The Source (US) and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which in October 1991 {{changed its name to}} America Online, and continued to operate its AOL service for the IBM PC compatible and Apple Macintosh. Q-Link was {{a modified version of the}} PlayNET system, which Control Video Corporation (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.|$|E
2500|$|PCBoard {{is still}} in use today by nostalgic BBS fans. There is a {{freeware}} FOSSIL driver called NetFoss which allows PCBoard to be accessible via <b>telnet</b> under Windows. There was also a DOS based PCBoard add-on [...] "PCB Internet Collection" [...] which allowed <b>telnet</b> access by installing a (DOS-only) packet driver.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the use of}} FidoNet {{has dropped}} {{dramatically}} compared with its use up to the mid-1990s, it is still used in many countries and especially Russia and former republics of the USSR. [...] Some BBSes, including those that are now available for users with Internet connections via <b>telnet,</b> also retain their FidoNet netmail and echomail feeds.|$|E
2500|$|MUD clients often contain {{functions}} {{which make}} certain tasks within a MUD easier to carry out, for example commands buttons {{which you can}} click {{in order to move}} in a particular direction or to pick up an item. [...] There are also tools available which add hotkey-activated macros to <b>telnet</b> and MUD clients giving the player the ability to move around the MUD using the arrow keys on their keyboard for example.|$|E
2500|$|Cryptography {{provides}} information security with other useful applications as well including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, non-repudiation, and encrypted network communications. Older less secure {{applications such as}} <b>telnet</b> and ftp are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as ssh that use encrypted network communications. [...] Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as WPA/WPA2 or the older (and less secure) WEP. Wired communications (such as ITU‑T G.hn) are secured using AES for encryption and X.1035 for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as GnuPG or PGP {{can be used to}} encrypt data files and Email.|$|E
2500|$|Lost Souls, as {{typical for}} MUDs, is {{accessed}} through a <b>telnet</b> client or specialized MUD client. [...] The interface is text-based, {{in what is}} often {{thought of as the}} Zork style. [...] The basic game structure follows common RPG conventions, with characters fighting, exploring, and questing to gain experience, gold and items. [...] Lost Soulss command structure and character model are unusually extensive for a game, however, and are noted as presenting a considerable amount of information to be learned. [...] This is a significant barrier to new players, though experienced players often see the learning curve as a rite of passage and appreciate the greater depth the extensive systemry brings to their later gameplay.|$|E
2500|$|Victoria Clarke, in her {{analysis}} of <b>telnet</b> talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that [...] "a user who types LOL {{may well be}} laughing louder than one who types lol", and opines that [...] "these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse". Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful {{so long as they}} are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are (in his view) appropriate in such correspondence. June Hines Moore shares that view. So, too, does Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, [...] "or you won't be LOL".|$|E
5000|$|Even though <b>Telnet</b> was {{an ad hoc}} {{protocol}} with {{no official}} definition until March 5, 1973, the name actually referred to Teletype Over Network Protocol as the RFC 206 (NIC 7176) on <b>Telnet</b> makes the connection clear: The <b>TELNET</b> protocol {{is based upon the}} notion of a virtual teletype, employing a 7-bit ASCII character set. The primary function of a User <b>TELNET,</b> then, is to provide the means by which its users can 'hit' all the keys on that virtual teletype. [...] Essentially, it used an 8-bit channel to exchange 7-bit ASCII data. Any byte with the high bit set was a special <b>Telnet</b> character. On March 5, 1973, a <b>Telnet</b> protocol standard was defined at UCLA with the publication of two NIC documents: <b>Telnet</b> Protocol Specification, NIC 15372, and <b>Telnet</b> Option Specifications, NIC 15373.|$|E
