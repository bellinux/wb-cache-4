We analyze the empirical relationship between changes in <b>Tax</b> <b>Burden</b> and changes in tax policies from 1987 to 2000 using states’ forecasts of revenue impacts of new tax legislation. Our two major findings have important implications. First, we demonstrate that income-induced, non-tax policy changes are a significant determinant of changes in <b>Tax</b> <b>Burden.</b> These income effects are likely to cause misinterpretation when <b>Tax</b> <b>Burden</b> {{is used as a}} variable in economic growth regressions. Second, we estimate that approximately half of the <b>total</b> variation in <b>Tax</b> <b>Burden</b> is due to changes in non-tax policy factors. This finding quantifies the extent of the “mismeasurement” problem which has been discussed, but not analyzed, in previous literature. In concluding, we promote the use of alternative approaches for estimating the economic effects of taxes...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{economic}} research has improved {{our understanding of}} who bears {{the burden of the}} corporate income tax. One key finding is that a substantial share of the return to corporate capital is from “supernormal ” returns, the returns to successful risk taking, inframarginal returns, and economic rents in excess of the “normal ” return (the riskless return to waiting). The other key result is that international capital mobility shifts some of the corporate income <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> on the normal return from corporate capital to labor, which is relatively immobile internationally. Based on these recent research findings, TPC has updated its corporate income tax incidence. For standard distributional analyses, TPC now treats 20 percent of the corporate income <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> as falling on labor, 20 percent on the normal return to all capital, and 60 percent on the supernormal returns to corporate equity (shareholders). Previously, we had treated the entire corporate income <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> as being borne by the total returns to all capital. Our updated approach to incidence reduces somewhat the measured progressivity of the corporate income tax, but has little effect on the distribution of the <b>total</b> federal <b>tax</b> <b>burden.</b> We now also distinguish the incidence of changes in the corporate income tax that affect only the normal return, such as changes in cost recovery rules, which we distribute 50 percent to labor and 50 percent to the normal return to all capital. In addition, for short-run analyses of changes in the corporate income tax we now treat all of the burden as falling on shareholders...|$|R

In offering several arguments in support of its repeal, the Treasury Department has denied the deductibility {{on the basis of the}} two basic rationales; that is, the deduction is not necessary to define the federal income tax base properly under the ideal fiscal federalism, and the deduction cannot be justified on the rate-limiting rationale under the rate reduction proposal. But, it arrives at the consistency with the proper treatmnet of the state and local taxes under the comprehensive income tax by substituing the marble cake type federal system with the layer cake type federal system. By identifying issues behind the justification for eliminating the deductibility, this analysis suggests that the Treasury's arguments for repealing the deductibility has several policy implications; reducing the <b>total</b> business <b>tax</b> <b>burden,</b> reducing the size of government at all levels, and using the revenue for the federal income tax rate reduction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This article {{deals with}} the problem of forming Pareto non-optimal norms of mutual {{behavior}} of investors and government in the process of decision-making related to financing designed to reduce risks in investment activity. Methodology: Considering the interdependent type (nature) of interactions between related parties, game theory tools were used to model such interactions. Much attention was directed to search for  parameters of interaction leading to certain Nash equilibriums in pure strategies. The formal results obtained with the model were verified by statistical analysis. Findings: Analysis showed that the rational behavior of related parties can lead to unexpected results. Powerful investors will aim to work in socially-oriented economies, whereas primarily small investors will operate in most liberal economies with a minimum <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> but with a higher level of risk. As for governments’ behaviors, the images are the same: small economies tend to liberalize their tax systems and to secure investment faster than powerful ones. Empirical verification based on statistical data of groups of countries generally confirmed the conclusions. These formal and logical conclusions were from statistical analysis of 124 countries divided into 5 groups: OECD countries, post-socialist countries, Latin American countries, APAC countries and ACP countries. Provided that the more powerful ones are covered economies, there was stronger interdependence between the size of economies and <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> and also between <b>total</b> investment and <b>tax</b> <b>burden,</b> where this dependence is positive. Originality: The results obtained used Nash equilibriums in pure strategies as models of behavioral norms to define behaviors of related parties and also to explain assumptions concerning the behaviors of investors and government. ...|$|R
