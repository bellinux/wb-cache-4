500|$|Oppong's {{performances}} {{helped him}} get an NCAA scholarship into Eastern Kentucky. Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
500|$|Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly {{compiled}} a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> ever walked onto a set {{was my first}} day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run Stagecoach, often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E

[...] "Then {{you shall}} {{take me for}} a drive to Fifth Avenue, or to see somebody's tomb, and my woman shall make some real Russian tea for us in my sitting-room.

500|$|Some of the album's {{songs were}} {{recorded}} by Saadiq with his live band, which included drummer Lemar Carter, bassist Calvin Turner, and guitarist Rob Bacon. Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd be times when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff {{that was out of}} tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph also contributed to the album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but I put my bass down [...] <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> tried to play bass for him, I couldn't even play. I froze three times. He's my all-time idol!".|$|E
500|$|Ruth was {{sometimes}} allowed to rejoin his family, or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with {{work in the}} community, {{but he was always}} returned to St. Mary's. He [...] was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral. How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long hits while playing street ball; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a catcher even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played third base and shortstop, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia. A large man, Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's. Ruth stated, [...] "I think I was born as a hitter <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> ever saw him hit a baseball." [...] The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer Robert W. Creamer commented on the closeness between the two: ...|$|E
2500|$|He is also, {{alongside}} Brendan Nelson, {{one of two}} federal Liberal leaders {{never to}} lead the party into an election. On opposition leadership, he said in 2008 that: [...] "The moment when I wanted to [...] was just about <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> started in the job. There was many a time {{from the first day}} onwards when I thought to myself, How the hell can I get out of this?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It {{amounts to}} more than that. I had an intuition that I should marry you from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> that <b>I</b> saw you, and yet {{it did not seem}} probable. But deep down in my soul I knew that I should marry you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding his nickname, Hatton said, [...] "I've {{always been}} a fan of Tommy Hearns, and {{everybody}} associates that that's where I got it from, but everybody's a Tommy Hearns fan. I got the nickname <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> walked in the gym. I was 10 years old and put a pair of gloves on and started walloping the bag, and my amateur coach said, [...] "Look at him, look how evil he is. He's a little Hitman." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "So Ben went to work", added Hayward. Hayward was {{to receive}} 10% of Hecht’s fees as his commission. [...] "He {{was a hell}} of a fast writer – {{sometimes}} too fast. I didn't even know how fast he could go... At the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> went back to Ben’s house. There he was, typing away... I said, 'Ben – please slow down.' Over the next few days, 'while watching the accumulated pages of Hecht’s script growing higher and higher, 'I couldn't slow the guy down!', sighed Hayward, who only made his commission for each day Hecht worked.|$|E
2500|$|Lyman later recalled: [...] "From <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> {{just loved}} the game, {{and we had}} some pretty good teams, too." [...] The 1921 Nebraska team {{compiled}} a 7–1 record, lost a close game against Knute Rockne's Notre Dame team, outscored opponents by a combined total of 283 to 17, and won the Missouri Valley Conference championship. [...] The 1922 Nebraska yearbook noted the following about Lyman: [...] "Lyman was, without doubt, our fastest lineman. Roy is a big man, weighing 200 pounds, and could get down under punts almost {{as quickly as the}} ends. Roy proved to be a ground gainer on tackle-around plays before the season was over." ...|$|E

500|$|Around 5 July 1941, Nebe {{consolidated}} Einsatzgruppe B near Minsk, {{establishing a}} headquarters and remaining {{there for two}} months. The killing activities progressed apace. In a 13 July Operational Situation Report, Nebe stated that 1,050 Jews {{had been killed in}} Minsk, and that in Vilna, the liquidation of the Jews was underway, and that five hundred Jews were shot daily. In the same report Nebe remarked that: [...] "only 96 Jews were executed in Grodno and Lida during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>days.</b> <b>I</b> gave orders to intensify these activities". He also reported that the killings were being brought into smooth running order and that the shootings were carried out [...] "at an increasing rate". The report also announced that in Minsk Einsatzgruppe was now killing non-Jews.|$|R

On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> went {{to take my}} seat in Mr. Dale's schoolroom, I carried my old grammar to him, in {{a modest}} pride, expecting some {{encouragement}} and honor for the accuracy with which I could repeat, on demand, some hundred and sixty close-printed pages of it.|$|R
2500|$|In a February 1993 interview, guitarist David Gilmour {{described}} Thomas' role on The Dark Side of the Moon as {{a referee}} for arguments {{between himself and}} bassist Roger Waters, stating that they [...] "argued {{so much that it}} was suggested we get a third opinion. We were going to leave Chris to mix it on his own, with Alan Parsons engineering. And of course on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> found out that Roger sneaked in there. So the second day I sneaked in there. And from then on, we both sat right at Chris's shoulder, interfering. But luckily, Chris was more sympathetic to my point of view than he was to Roger's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{current and}} former congressional {{employees}} recalled Foley approaching young male pages at parties, going back many years, and say that warnings about him were commonly passed around. Generally speaking, he was [...] "known to be extraordinarily friendly {{in a way that}} made some [...] uncomfortable." [...] According to Mark Beck-Heyman, who served as a Republican page in summer 1995, [...] "Almost <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> got there I was warned. It was no secret that Foley had a special interest in male pages." [...] He alleged that many people on Capitol Hill, including Republican staffers, [...] "have known for over 11 years about what was going on and chose to do nothing." [...] Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said on MSNBC that [...] "I‘ve had people now on staff that used to be pages, and it was widely known to watch out for him, that he liked boys ... so pages were warned to watch out for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tracht {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} the South Bronx (New York City) with his younger sister, Diana, and parents, Alfred and Gertrude Tracht. His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran {{immigrant}} from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator. Tracht attended DeWitt Clinton High School and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at Ithaca College and landed a job at the college radio station. [...] "From <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> got on the air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. After my first year in college, I had this station (WYSL) in Buffalo, New York, offer me a big time job." [...] Tracht got a job at WTKO, a low-power top-40 station in Ithaca. The following year, he had moved up to night DJ at a larger station in Binghamton, New York, WENE. Tracht graduated from Ithaca College in 1972 ...|$|E
