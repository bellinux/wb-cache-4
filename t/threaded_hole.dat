2500|$|In North America, fuses {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later fuse boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S fuses) which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison fuse boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) fuses, by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. [...] This adapter screws into the existing Edison fuse holder, and has a smaller diameter <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> to accept the designated Type S rated fuse.|$|E
50|$|A {{threaded}} insert, {{also known}} as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole.</b> They may be used to repair a stripped <b>threaded</b> <b>hole,</b> provide a durable <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a plain hole on the fatigue {{properties}} of a body undergoing uniaxial loading is a well-studied area. However, for the case of <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> that are not being used together with a bolt, little {{can be found in}} the literature. In this project, stress concentration factors, Ktn, for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes,</b> following the ISO metric standard, have been calculated using finite element models in ANSYS. Based on theser esults, estimations of the fatigue notch factor, Ktf, for the <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> were derived. The magnitude of Ktf depends on how the notch sensitivity index, q, is being determined. In this project, both Neuber’s and Peterson’s formulas were used as estimates of q and a comparison between the two methods was made. The stress concentration factors for the <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> were significantly higher than the corresponding stress concentration factors for plain holes. As the size of the hole and the surrounding body was increased, Ktn decreased. In the fatigue analysis, Peterson’s formula predicted higher values of the fatigue notch factor compared to Neuber’s and could therefore be useful in design purposes. Furthermore, the reduction in fatigue strength for the <b>threaded</b> <b>holes,</b> compared to the plain holes, was calculated. These results showed that the percentage decrease in fatigue strength for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> was approximately the same, regardless if Neuber’s or Peterson’s estimation of q was used. The reduction in fatigue strength for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> with a coarse pitch, compared to plain holes, varied from about 16 % for the smallest diameter tested(M 6) to about 10 % for the biggest (M 68). The corresponding reduction for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> with a fine pitch varied from about 14 % for the smallest diameter (M 6) to about 9 % for the biggest (M 64). As the size of the hole and the surrounding body was increased, the threads’ effect on the fatigue strength decreased...|$|R

50|$|Around this time, Europe was {{beginning}} to enter an era of industrial revolution, and new technological breakthroughs helped provide timpanists with possible ways to alter the pitch {{on one of their}} drums. The first major advancement {{is believed to have been}} made by Gerhard Cramer in 1812. The new orchestral works required faster tuning of the timpani. He worked with a court locksmith and the royal armorer to make his first set of drums. Although no diagrams or drawings of what the drums actually looked like exist, there are several rough descriptions of how the drums worked. The kettle of the drum was attached to a wooden base. Rods curved down along the kettle and connected the counter hoop to a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> at the bottom of the bowl. There was a bolt inside of the <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> that allowed for the entire mechanism to be raised and lowered. In order for the bolt to be turned and the drum to move, there were several levers that led to a larger vertical lever that came out of the wooden base and when moved would either raise or lower the bowl, thus changing the pitch.|$|E
50|$|A sleeve {{coupling}} {{consists of a}} pipe whose bore is finished to the required tolerance based on the shaft size. Based on the usage of the coupling a keyway {{is made in the}} bore in order to transmit the torque by means of the key. Two <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> are provided in order to lock the coupling in position.|$|R
50|$|A lathe {{faceplate}} {{is a basic}} workholding accessory for a wood {{or metal}} turning lathe. It is a circular metal (usually cast iron) plate which fixes {{to the end of}} the lathe spindle. The workpiece is then clamped to the faceplate, typically using t-nuts in slots in the faceplate, or less commonly <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> in the faceplate itself.|$|R
50|$|Similarly {{important}} is the geometry of the parts. Long, thin, branching, <b>threaded</b> <b>holes,</b> which could contain jammed chips, feature among the greatest challenges in this technical field. high pressure and the power wash process are one way to remove these chips as well as robots, which are programmed to exactly flush the drilled holes under high pressure.|$|R
50|$|The nominal {{diameter}} of a metric screw is the outer {{diameter of the}} thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which {{is the size of}} the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1 mm, is made by threading a 6 mm shank, and the nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5 mm diameter (6 mm - 1 mm).|$|E
50|$|A {{screw jack}} {{consists}} of a heavy-duty vertical screw with a load table mounted on its top, which screws into a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in a stationary support frame with a wide base resting on the ground. A rotating collar {{on the head of}} the screw has holes into which the handle, a metal bar, fits. When the handle is turned clockwise, the screw moves further out of the base, lifting the load resting on the load table. In order to support large load forces, the screw usually has either square threads or buttress threads.|$|E
50|$|The {{recirculating}} ball steering mechanism contains {{a worm gear}} inside a block with a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in it; this block has gear teeth cut into the outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a sector gear) which moves the Pitman arm. The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the Pitman arm, causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|E
50|$|The #6-32 UNC screws {{are often}} found on hard disk drives and the case's body {{to secure the}} covers. The M3 <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> are often found on optical disc drives and floppy drives.

50|$|A {{blind hole}} {{refers to a}} hole that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a blind hole. Other types of holes also include through holes, and clearance holes. In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the blind hole, conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|E
50|$|In a cross dowel application, the {{two pieces}} of wood are aligned and a bolt hole is drilled through one piece of wood and into the other. A dowel hole is drilled {{laterally}} across the bolt hole and the cross dowel is inserted into it. A screwdriver is inserted into the slot {{at the end of}} the cross dowel and the dowel is rotated so that its <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> aligns with the bolt hole. The bolt is then inserted into the bolt hole and screwed into the cross dowel until the wood pieces are held tightly together.|$|E
50|$|Usually the {{standoff}} has a #6-32 UNC male thread {{on one end}} which screws into a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in the case or motherboard backplate, and a #6-32 UNC female thread in the other end which accepts a screw to retain the motherboard. Less often, {{the standoff}} has a female thread in both ends and a second screw is used to attach it to the case. Some standoffs use the M3 female thread (which faces the motherboard) instead of #6-32 UNC, and on a rare occasion a mixture of types {{can be used in}} the same case.|$|E

50|$|Modern cycling {{shoes are}} {{designed}} to work with clipless pedal systems. Such systems temporarily connect the shoe to the pedal like a ski binding system for maximal efficiency of power-transfer using a cleat {{on the bottom of}} each shoe and a matched fitting on the pedal. Several manufacturers produce these systems; consequently, modern shoes usually have <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> in the sole in various arrangements to attach cleats from different manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Using {{cage nuts}} {{provides}} several benefits over <b>threaded</b> <b>holes.</b> It permits {{a range of}} choice of nut and bolts size (e.g. metric vs imperial) in the field, long after the equipment has been manufactured. Second, if a screw is over-tightened, the nut can be replaced, unlike a pre-threaded hole, where a <b>hole</b> with stripped <b>threads</b> becomes unusable. Third, cage nuts are easy to use on materials too thin or soft to be threaded.|$|R
