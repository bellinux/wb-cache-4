Now with deep sorrow I {{must tell you}} that yesterday I [...] assisted in laying her dear remains in the lonely grave. She died at [...] 7 o’clock on Wednesday evening, I suppose by the time you had got the [...] letter. The Dr. did not think it was croup till late on Tuesday [...] night, and all that Medical aid could prescribe was done, but the Dr. [...] had no hope after he saw that the croup was confirmed, and hard [...] indeed would the heart have been that would not have melted at seeing [...] what the dear little creature suffered all Wednesday until the feeble [...] frame was quite worn out. She was quite sensible till within 2 hours [...] of her death, and then she sunk quite low till the vital spark fled, [...] and all medicine that she got she took with the greatest readiness, [...] as if apprehensive they would make her well. I cannot well describe [...] my feelings on the occasion. I thought that the fountain-head of my [...] tears had now been dried up, but I have been mistaken, for I must [...] confess that the briny rivulets descended fast on my furrowed cheeks, [...] she was such a winning Child, and had such a regard for me and always [...] came and told me all her little things, and as she was now speaking, [...] some of her little prattle was very taking, and the lively images of [...] these things intrude themselves more into my mind than they should [...] do, but there is allowance for moderate grief on such occasions. But [...] when I am telling you of my own grief and sorrow, I know not what to [...] say of the bereaved Mother, she hath not met with anything in this [...] world before that hath gone so near the quick with her. She had no [...] handling of the last one as she was not able at the time, for she [...] only had her once in her arms, and her affections had not time to be [...] so fairly entwined around her. I am much afraid that she will not [...] soon if ever get over this trial. Although she was weakly before, [...] yet she was pretty well recovered, but this hath not only affected [...] her mind, but her body is so much affected that she is not well able [...] to sit so long as her bed is making and hath scarcely tasted meat [...] [i.e. food] since Monday night, and till some <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>elapsed</b> we [...] cannot say how she may be. There is none that is not a Parent [...] themselves that can fully sympathise with one in such a state. David [...] is much affected also, but it is not so well known on him, and the [...] younger branches of the family are affected but it will be only [...] momentary. But alas in all this vast ado, there is only the sorrow [...] of the world which worketh death. O how gladdening would it be if we [...] were in as great bitterness for sin as for the loss of a first-born. [...] O how unfitted persons or families is for trials who knows not the [...] divine art of casting all their cares upon the Lord, and what [...] multitudes are there that when earthly comforts is taken away, may [...] well say What have I more? all their delight is placed in some one [...] thing or another in the world, and who can blame them for unwillingly [...] parting with what they esteem their chief good? O that we were wise [...] to lay up treasure for the time of need, for it is truly a solemn [...] affair to enter the lists with the king of terrors. It is strange [...] that the living lay the things so little to heart until they have to [...] engage in that war where there is no discharge. O that my head were [...] waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that I might weep day and [...] night for my own and others’ stupidity in this great matter. O for [...] grace to do every day work in its proper time and to live above the [...] tempting cheating train of earthly things. The rest of the family [...] are moderately well. I have been for some days worse than I have [...] been for 8 months past, but I may soon get better. I am in the same [...] way I have often been in before, but there is no security for it [...] always being so, for I know that it cannot be far from the time when [...] I will be one of those that once were. I have no other news to send [...] you, and as little heart for them. I hope you will take the earliest [...] opportunity of writing that you can, and be particular as regards [...] Margaret, for she requires consolation.’ ...|$|E

40|$|Network {{decontamination}} is a {{well known}} mobile agent problem with many applications. We assume that all nodes of a network are contaminated (e. g., by a virus) {{and a set of}} agents is deployed to decontaminate them. An agent passing by a node decontaminates it, however a decontaminated node can be recontaminated if any of its neighbours is contaminated. In the vast literature a variety of models are considered and different assumptions are made on the power of the agents. In this thesis we study variation of the decontamination problem in mesh and tori topologies, under the assumption that when a node is decontaminated, it is immune to recontamination for a predefined amount of time t (called immunity time). After the immunity <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>elapsed,</b> recontamination can occur. We focus on three different models: mobile agents (MA), cellular automata (CA), and mobile cellular automata (MCA). The first two models are commonly studied and employed in several other contexts, the third model is introduced in this thesis for the first time. In each model we study the temporal decontamination problem (adapted to the particular setting) under a variety of assumptions on the capabilities of the decontaminating elements (agents for MA and MCA, decontaminating cells for CA). Some of the parameters we consider in this study are: visibility of the active elements, their ability to make copies of themselves, their ability to communicate, and the possibility to remember their past actions (memory). We describe several solutions in the various scenarios and we analyze their complexity. Efficiency is evaluated slightly differently in each model, but essentially the effort is in the minimization of the number of simultaneous decontaminating elements active in the system while performing the decontamination with a given immunity time...|$|E
40|$|In recent time a great {{attention}} {{is devoted to}} the solution of inverse problems in groundwater and, more specifically, in pollution transport. One of the main problems occurring in literature is the identification of the location of the pollutant source of the release history of the pollutant injection. Such information is deduced by the analysis of the pollutant concentration measured in monitoring points located in the aquifer. The reliability {{of the results of the}} different numerical procedures depends on several factors linked up with the presence of errors in the main data as important measurement errors, uncertainty in the knowledge of the aquifer parameters, etc. Nevertheless, the transport process itself, because of the effect of the dispersion, can be the reason for unreliable results of such procedures: in fact the role of the dispersion can hide the original characteristics of the release history smoothing peak values and broadening the duration of impulsive release. Moreover, the identification of the source can lead to a low confidence location since a too-wide area can be suspected to contain the font of pollution. As an example if the monitoring point is too far from the source or a long <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>elapsed</b> from the release the detected concentrations can be useless for the inversion procedure. In this work we identify threshold criteria that can, a priori, define if the inversion procedure can lead to reliable or unreliable results in order to distinguish the uncertainty due to the dispersion process itself from the measurement and hydraulic parameter errors. We have experience in the geostatistic approach for the restoring of the release history that is based on the use of the transfer function: starting from the analysis of the transfer function in a monitoring point we define the criteria which allow the forecast of unreliable solution of the inverse proble...|$|E

40|$|Systems {{used for}} target localization, such as goods, individuals, or animals, {{commonly}} rely on operational means {{to meet the}} final application demands. However, {{what would happen if}} some means were powered up randomly by harvesting systems? And what if those devices not randomly powered had their duty cycles restricted? Under what conditions would such an operation be tolerable in localization services? What if the references provided by nodes in a tracking problem were distorted? Moreover, there is an underlying topic common to the previous questions regarding the transfer of conceptual models to reality in field tests: what challenges are faced upon deploying a localization network that integrates energy harvesting modules? The application scenario of the system studied is a traditional herding environment of semi domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in northern Scandinavia. In these conditions, information on approximate locations of reindeer is as important as environmental preservation. Herders also need cost-effective devices capable of operating unattended in, sometimes, extreme weather conditions. The analyses developed are worthy not only for the specific application environment presented, but also because they may serve as an approach to performance of navigation systems in absence of reasonably accurate references like the ones of the Global Positioning System (GPS). A number of energy-harvesting solutions, like thermal and radio-frequency harvesting, do not commonly provide power beyond one milliwatt. When they do, battery buffers may be needed (as it happens with solar energy) which may raise costs and make systems more dependent on environmental temperatures. In general, given our problem, a harvesting system is needed that be capable of providing energy bursts of, at least, some milliwatts. Many works on localization problems assume that devices have certain capabilities to determine unknown locations based on range-based techniques or fingerprinting which cannot be assumed in the approach considered herein. The system presented is akin to range-free techniques, but goes to the extent of considering very low node densities: most range-free techniques are, therefore, not applicable. Animal localization, in particular, uses to be supported by accurate devices such as GPS collars which deplete batteries in, maximum, a few days. Such short-life solutions are not particularly desirable in the framework considered. In tracking, the challenge may times addressed aims at attaining high precision levels from complex reliable hardware and thorough processing techniques. One of the challenges in this Thesis is the use of equipment with just part of its facilities in permanent operation, which may yield high input noise levels in the form of distorted reference points. The solution presented integrates a kinetic harvesting module in some nodes which are expected to be a majority in the network. These modules are capable of providing power bursts of some milliwatts which suffice to meet node energy demands. The usage of harvesting modules in the aforementioned conditions makes the system less dependent on environmental temperatures as no batteries are used in nodes with harvesters [...] it may be also an advantage in economic terms. There is a second kind of nodes. They are battery powered (without kinetic energy harvesters), and are, therefore, dependent on temperature and battery replacements. In addition, their operation is constrained by duty cycles in order to extend node lifetime and, consequently, their autonomy. There is, in turn, a third type of nodes (hotspots) which can be static or mobile. They are also battery-powered, and are used to retrieve information from the network so that it is presented to users. The system operational chain starts at the kinetic-powered nodes broadcasting their own identifier. If an identifier is received at a battery-powered node, the latter stores it for its records. Later, as the recording node meets a hotspot, its full record of detections is transferred to the hotspot. Every detection registry comprises, at least, a node identifier and the position read from its GPS module by the battery-operated node previously to detection. The characteristics of the system presented make the aforementioned operation own certain particularities which are also studied. First, identifier transmissions are random as they depend on movements at kinetic modules [...] reindeer movements in our application. Not every movement suffices since it must overcome a certain energy threshold. Second, identifier transmissions may not be heard unless there is a battery-powered node in the surroundings. Third, battery-powered nodes do not poll continuously their GPS module, hence localization errors rise even more. Let's recall at this point that such behavior is tight to the aforementioned power saving policies to extend node lifetime. Last, some <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>elapsed</b> between the instant an identifier random transmission is detected and the moment the user is aware of such a detection: it takes some time to find a hotspot. Tracking is posed as a problem of a single kinetically-powered target and a population of battery-operated nodes with higher densities than before in localization. Since the latter provide their approximate positions as reference locations, the study is again focused on assessing the impact of such distorted references on performance. Unlike in localization, distance-estimation capabilities based on signal parameters are assumed in this problem. Three variants of the Kalman filter family are applied in this context: the regular Kalman filter, the alpha-beta filter, and the unscented Kalman filter. The study enclosed hereafter comprises both field tests and simulations. Field tests were used mainly to assess the challenges related to power supply and operation in extreme conditions as well as to model nodes and some aspects of their operation in the application scenario. These models are the basics of the simulations developed later. The overall system performance is analyzed according to three metrics: number of detections per kinetic node, accuracy, and latency. The links between these metrics and the operational conditions are also discussed and characterized statistically. Subsequently, such statistical characterization is used to forecast performance figures given specific operational parameters. In tracking, also studied via simulations, nonlinear relationships are found between accuracy and duty cycles and cluster sizes of battery-operated nodes. The solution presented may be more complex in terms of network structure than existing solutions based on GPS collars. However, its main gain lies on taking advantage of users' error tolerance to reduce costs and become more environmentally friendly by diminishing the potential amount of batteries that can be lost. Whether it is applicable or not depends ultimately on the conditions and requirements imposed by users' needs and operational environments, which is, as it has been explained, one of the topics of this Thesis...|$|E

5000|$|Priming effects {{occur when}} the prime {{influences}} the motor response to the target: consistent primes speed responses to the target, whereas inconsistent primes slow responses (Fig. 2). Priming effects in response <b>times</b> <b>are</b> calculated by taking the difference between response times in inconsistent and consistent trials. Apart from their effects on response speed, primes can greatly affect the rate of response errors (i.e., erroneous responses to the target): consistent primes rarely lead to errors, whereas error rates can become very high for inconsistent primes. In response times as well as error rates, priming effects typically increase with SOA, leading to the typical response priming patterns in Fig. 2. This implies that the more <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>elapsing</b> between prime and target, the larger the prime's influences on the response. For average response times of 350-450 ms, the response priming effect can become as large as 100 ms, {{making it one of}} the numerically largest effects in response time research. Results from many experiments show that the increase of priming with SOA occurs because the prime has an increasing amount of time to influence the response process before the actual target stimulus can come into play and control the motor response on its own. This is evident from the time-course of motor activity in the EEG, from primed pointing responses, from measurements of response force, and from simulation studies, which all suggest that motor activation first occurs in the direction specified by the prime, and only then proceeds in the direction specified by the actual target. Therefore, the ultimate size of the priming effect depends both on properties of the stimuli and on properties of the task. Primes with high stimulus energy (e.g., higher contrast, longer duration) and tasks with easy stimulus discriminations lead to large priming effects, whereas primes with low stimulus energy and tasks with difficult discriminations lead to smaller effects. [...] Priming effects can be amplified by visual attention directed to the prime's position or to its relevant features just in time for the prime's appearance.|$|R
