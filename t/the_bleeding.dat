5|$|Mycena haematopus, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> fairy helmet, the burgundydrop bonnet, or <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> Mycena, is a species of fungus in the Mycenaceae family, of the order Agaricales. It is widespread and common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in Japan and Venezuela. It is saprotrophic—meaning that it obtains nutrients by consuming decomposing organic matter—and the fruit bodies appear in small groups or clusters on the decaying logs, trunks, and stumps of deciduous trees, particularly beech. The fungus, first described scientifically in 1799, is classified in the section Lactipedes of the genus Mycena, along with other species that produce a milky or colored latex.|$|E
5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E
50|$|In {{printing}}, bleed is printing {{that goes}} beyond the edge of where the sheet will be trimmed. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> is <b>the</b> area to be trimmed off. <b>The</b> <b>bleed</b> is <b>the</b> part {{on the side of a}} document that gives the printer a small amount of space to account for movement of the paper, and design inconsistencies. Artwork and background colors often extend into <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> area. After trimming, <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> ensures that no unprinted edges occur in the final trimmed document.|$|R

5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E

5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched to stop <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bleed</b> {{is not a}} {{universe}} in itself, but it {{is defined as the}} space between parallel universes. In the Wildstorm Universe, the most advanced beings can travel between parallel universes through <b>the</b> <b>Bleed,</b> or, simply, an arterial duct connecting to universes. Travelling through <b>the</b> <b>Bleed</b> is not without danger though and sometimes objects or beings get lost, appearing in times and places they were never meant to go.

5|$|Following the Mexican–American War, Washington {{traveled}} to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush and authored the novel, A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence. Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained {{for a few}} years and fought as a Border Ruffian during <b>the</b> <b>Bleeding</b> Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. While under the command of Captain Henry Clay Pate, Washington was present at the June 1856 Free-Stater attack known as Battle of Black Jack, where he sustained minor injuries. Washington died by drowning after falling overboard from a steamboat on the Missouri River in September 1856. His family's descendants claim Washington was murdered by Jayhawkers.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Waters contributed {{songs and}} a score to the soundtrack of the {{animated}} movie When the Wind Blows, {{based on the}} Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as <b>The</b> <b>Bleeding</b> Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who {{has the ability to}} physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state {{of the world in which}} he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.|$|E

5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|May {{spent most}} of his career in the Second Regiment of Dragoons, but also had a brief stint in the First Regiment of Dragoons. As a lieutenant, he participated in the Second Seminole War, where he was {{responsible}} for the capture of an important tribal chief. During the Mexican War, he commanded a squadron during Zachary Taylor's expedition, and saw action in the Battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, Monterrey, and Buena Vista. He distinguished himself in those actions and was eventually promoted to the rank of brevet colonel, with a permanent rank of major. May later served {{in various parts of the}} American frontier, including during <b>the</b> <b>Bleeding</b> Kansas crisis.|$|E
5|$|Ryan White {{was born}} at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> would not stop. When he was three days old, doctors {{diagnosed}} him with severe hemophilia A, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of Factor VIII, a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
40|$|Various control-volume models used {{to analyze}} the shock {{boundary}} layer bleed interaction were investigated. <b>The</b> <b>bleed</b> assumptions of <b>the</b> models and their influence on the analytical solutions are discussed. The results of the analysis using these models are compared with experimental boundary-layer data taken in a supersonic inlet. The experimental Mach number upstream of the interaction was 1. 66, and the oblique-shock pressure ratio was 1. 33. The boundary layer data included bleed flow rates up to approximately 0. 6 of the upstream boundary layer mass flow rate. The first model assumed <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> was removed from the control volume with a momentum that was characterized by a pressure intermediate between the upstream and downstream pressures. The second model assumed the control volume was bounded by a streamline dividing <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> and residual flows and eliminated the need to specify the momentum of <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> flow. Comparison of the results using the models showed that specifying <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> pressure in one model was equivalent to specifying the pressure along the dividing streamline in the other...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of porous bleed regions as boundary conditions in {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations of supersonic inlet flows has been improved through a scaling of sonic flow coefficient data for 90 deg <b>bleed</b> holes. <b>The</b> scaling removed the Mach number {{as a factor in}} computing the sonic flow coefficient and allowed the data to be fitted with a quadratic equation, with the only factor being the ratio of the plenum static pressure to the surface static pressure. The implementation of <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> model into <b>the</b> Wind-US CFD flow solver was simplified by no longer requiring the evaluation of the flow properties at the boundary-layer edge. The quadratic equation can be extrapolated to allow the {{modeling of}} small amounts of blowing, which can exist when recirculation of <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> flow occurs within <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> region. <b>The</b> improved accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> model was demonstrated through CFD simulations of bleed regions on a flat plate in supersonic flow with and without an impinging oblique shock. <b>The</b> <b>bleed</b> model demonstrated good agreement with experimental data and three-dimensional CFD simulations of bleed holes...|$|R

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1859, but the {{frontier}} violence caused them to move to Missouri in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha's disease. As the American Civil War neared, violence spread into Missouri during <b>the</b> <b>Bleeding</b> Kansas incidents. In October 1860 several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls' neighbors warned that Green was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even farther from the volatile border region.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after <b>the</b> <b>bleeding,</b> even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E

5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived.

Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> disorder in the royal family was hereditary.
