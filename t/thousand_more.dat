5|$|In 1992, London annexed {{nearly the}} entire {{township}} of Westminster, a large, primarily rural municipality directly south of the city, including the police village of Lambeth. With this massive annexation, London almost doubled in area again, adding several <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> residents. In modern day, London stretches south to the boundary with Elgin County, north to the Town of Arva and Fanshawe Lake, west to Komoka, and East to Nilestown and Dorchester.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E

5|$|Prior to full production, {{the team}} created a tech demo in 2012 {{to test the}} {{creation}} and movement of highly detailed models and environments. This tech demo was titled Agni's Philosophy, which also acted as a test demo for the Luminous Studio engine which {{would be used for}} Final Fantasy XV. Character designs and modelling was overseen by Business Division 2; the team was led by Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character model supervisor. The character Crowe's hair was based on the hairstyle for the main female protagonist of Agni's Philosophy. The hairstyles for both Crowe and Lunafreya were first modelled using a real mannequin wig to ensure they could be managed. Their fully rendered wigs were composed of three thousand curves each, a <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> than originally estimated.|$|E
5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath Alliance – the {{original}} name of Birmingham City Football Club – played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green district of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where St Andrew's would be built. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with an estimated capacity of 3,000 spectators; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. Interest in the team grew, {{and a year later}} they moved again, this time to a rented field in Small Heath, situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. This ground, which became known as Muntz Street, had four sides of open terracing, a small covered wooden stand, and a changing-room for the players. When first opened it could hold approximately 10,000 spectators. Over the years the height of the terracing was raised, which increased the capacity to around 30,000, but this became insufficient to cope with the demand. The attendance at a match in 1905 against local rivals Aston Villa was officially recorded as 28,000 spectators, but several <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> climbed walls or forced turnstiles to gain entry. The landlords refused to sell the freehold of the ground, nor would they permit major extensions to be made. As the board of directors estimated that staying at Muntz Street was costing the club £2,000 a year (£ at today's prices), they began the search for an alternative site.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese had {{successfully}} evacuated {{a total of}} 10,652 men from Guadalcanal, about {{all that remained of}} the 36,000 total troops sent to the island during the campaign. Six hundred of the evacuees succumbed to their injuries or illnesses before they could receive sufficient medical care. Three <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> required lengthy hospitalization or recuperation. After receiving word of the completion of the operation, Yamamoto commended all the units involved and ordered Kondo to return to Truk with his warships. The 2nd and 38th Divisions were shipped to Rabaul and partially reconstituted with replacements. The 2nd Division was relocated to the Philippines in March 1943 while the 38th was assigned to defend Rabaul and New Ireland. The 8th Area Army and Southeast Area Fleet reoriented their forces to defend the central Solomons at Kolombangara and New Georgia and prepared to send the reinforcements, mainly consisting of the 51st Infantry Division, originally detailed for Guadalcanal to New Guinea. The 17th Army was rebuilt around the 6th Infantry Division and headquartered on Bougainville. A few Japanese stragglers remained on Guadalcanal, many of whom were subsequently killed or captured by Allied patrols. The last known Japanese holdout surrendered in October 1947.|$|E
5|$|While Skanderbeg {{had been}} away, a large Ottoman assault {{was made on}} Krujë from the Tirana side, but {{inadvertent}} friendly fire from the Turks forced them to call off the assault. The Ottomans then attempted to mine the fortress, but could not succeed, since the fortress had been built on rock. Since the food supplies were beginning to run out, the Turks received provisions from Venice, as did the Albanians. The Turkish attacks had made no headway and the Ottoman army had lost many dead or wounded, whereas Skanderbeg's force had lost 1,000 men thus far. Moisi Golemi and Tanush Thopia raised a couple <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> and the force was split between the three, making attacks on the Turkish camp easier. Skanderbeg began to move towards the camp as the Turks had assembled 8,000 men which began to move towards him. Skanderbeg slowly retired, while Moisi and Tanush broke into the camp. The Turkish force sent against Skanderbeg was lured towards the foothills {{and the next morning}} (July 25) they were surrounded and completely destroyed. The next day, Skanderbeg was seen above the rocks of Krujë, in conference with Vrana Konti, surprising Murad.|$|E

25|$|The life of {{ordinary}} Parisians was extremely difficult, {{due to a}} very cold winter in 1794–95, there were shortages and long lines for bread, firewood, charcoal meat, sugar, coffee, vegetables and wine. The money dropped sharply in value; an assignat, or banknote originally issued for one hundred livres, was worth thirty-four livres {{at the time of}} death of Robespierre, and sixteen in March 1795, and 4 in June 1795. Two thousand six hundred Parisians were reported as dying from hunger in January 1795, and two <b>thousand</b> <b>more</b> during the spring.|$|E
