5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> at birth; {{it is impossible to}} kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of this}} {{association}} of delinquents, Mussolini, while yellow with rancour and fear and trying to cross the Swiss frontier, has been arrested. He must be handed over to a tribunal of the people so it can judge him quickly. We want this, even though we think an execution platoon is {{too much of an}} honour for this man. He would deserve <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> like a mangy dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend of}} Abhartach - an evil tyrant who {{repeatedly}} escapes his grave to spread terror (and in some accounts {{to drink the}} blood of his subjects, {{to be one of}} the neamh-mairbh (un-dead), and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> only by with a sword of yew wood and to be buried upside-down).|$|E

5|$|The water bull {{is said to}} {{reproduce}} with standard cattle, the resulting progeny distinguishable by {{the small size of}} their ears. According to some myths, the calves of water bulls and ordinary cows ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> at birth by any method other than drowning– they cannot be killed by drowning– to avoid bringing disaster to the herd. Conversely, in northern areas the calves are considered to be of superior quality.|$|E
5|$|This {{integrated}} viral DNA {{may then}} lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection.

This means that those cells most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> by HIV are those currently fighting infection.|$|E
5|$|An {{expedition}} {{was immediately}} {{prepared to take}} punitive action against the Ghassanids. Muhammad appointed Zayd ibn Harithah as {{the commander of the}} force.

5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed,</b> and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed,</b> but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E
5|$|Ballooning was a risky {{business}} for the pioneers. Blanchard lost consciousness on a few occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, {{she became the first}} woman <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> in an aviation accident when, during an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, she launched fireworks that ignited the gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the roof of a house and she fell to her death. She is commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard.|$|E

5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
