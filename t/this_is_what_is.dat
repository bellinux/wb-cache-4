5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5|$|Key's third game Clannad is {{a visual}} novel similar to Key's {{previous}} games, but contains no adult content. Clannad {{was meant to}} be released in 2002, but was delayed, leading to the game finally being released on April 28, 2004. Seven months after Clannads release, Key released their shortest game, , on November 29, 2004 with a rating for all ages. Planetarian, in contrast to Key's past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make choices during gameplay; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> referred to as a kinetic novel. The brand's fifth game is , an adult game and spin-off to Clannad released on November 25, 2005, which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Tomoyo Sakagami from Clannad. Key released their sixth game, Little Busters!, on July 27, 2007 with no adult content, but released another version of the game entitled Little Busters! Ecstasy on July 25, 2008 with added adult content, story, and visuals.|$|E
25|$|In England, the {{introduction}} of family names is generally attributed to {{the preparation of the}} Domesday Book in 1086, following the Norman conquest. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and only slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. But some early Norman nobles in England chose to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings.|$|E

25|$|An {{oversight}} in {{the application}} of the no-hair theorem is the assumption that the relevant degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of the black hole must be classical in nature; what if they were purely quantum mechanical instead and had non-zero entropy? Actually, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> realized in the LQG derivation of black hole entropy, and {{can be seen as a}} consequence of its background-independence – the classical black hole spacetime comes about from the semiclassical limit of the quantum state of the gravitational field, but there are many quantum states that have the same semiclassical limit. Specifically, in LQG it is possible to associate a quantum geometrical interpretation to the microstates: These are the quantum geometries of the horizon which are consistent with the area, , of the black hole and the topology of the horizon (i.e. spherical). LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area of the horizon. These calculations have been generalized to rotating black holes.|$|E
