The Aircraft Synthetic <b>Training</b> <b>Aids</b> (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.|$|E

25|$|Having <b>training</b> <b>aids</b> {{may make}} it easier to become {{comfortable}} with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. One other easy way to learn is to find a narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or clothes line is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, whilst holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|E

[...] He met fellow inductee Larry Cohen, who later cast him in Q, The Winged Serpent. He also faced court-martial for shoplifting. In 1962, Donna gave birth to their daughter, Calista.

2500|$|Early in the war, {{a lot of}} {{training}} was very brief or non-existent. This was particularly true where men and machines were rushed into combat to meet an enemy that had been preparing and fighting for years.

[...] Thus, the creation of the JCET. [...] It allows SOF to train foreign troops not so much because THEY need it, but because it is a training event that allows the SF folks to maintain instructional skills, develop <b>training</b> <b>aids,</b> hone best instructor practices, language skills, etc., in preparation for combat employment in a FID or UW environment.

In August 2012, a deal for 22 Hawk 'Advanced Jet Trainers' worth approximately $800 million was announced. The AJTs would replace older models of Hawks in the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) inventory. The Hawk is flown by the RSAF demonstration team. In February 2016 it emerged that Saudi Arabia had doubled the number of Hawk AJT aircraft it had ordered from BAE Systems, with an order for a further 22. This was revealed in the company's preliminary annual report for 2015; [...] "We reached agreement with the Saudi customer for the provision of a further 22 Hawk AJT aircraft, associated ground equipment, and <b>training</b> <b>aids</b> for the RSAF which form part of an enhancement to the Kingdom's training capacity."

40|$|We {{are pleased}} to provide you this “Airplane Upset Recovery <b>Training</b> <b>Aid</b> Revision 2 ”. This {{document}} was developed in response to FAA request for us to convene an industry and government working group to develop guidance to flight crews {{as it pertains to}} issues associated with operations, unintentional slowdowns, and recoveries in the high altitude environment. In the interest of defining an effective document, it has been decided to introduce this package as a supplement to the Airplane Upset Recovery <b>Training</b> <b>Aid</b> first released in 1998. While the Airplane Upset Recovery <b>Training</b> <b>Aid</b> specifically addressed airplanes with 100 seats or greater, the information in this supplement is directly applicable to most jet airplanes that routinely operate in this environment. This supplemental information has been inserted in the Airplane Upset Recovery <b>Training</b> <b>Aid</b> Rev 2 completed October 2008. As a group of industry experts, we are confident we achieved the goal of defining a reference that will be effective to educate pilots so they have the knowledge and skill to adequately operate their airplanes and prevent upsets in a high altitude environment. The key point is that no reference material published is of value unless it is used. To that end, we implore the FAA to produce language to support implementation of this material that will motivate operators to use it. Indeed, the current Airplane Upset Recovery <b>Training</b> <b>Aid</b> serves as an excellent example of a collaborative reference produced at the insistence of th...|$|R
