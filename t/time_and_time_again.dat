5|$|The British camp in Balaclava {{was on a}} plateau, {{with two}} {{approaches}} – the South and North valleys – and a small hill, known as the Causeway Heights, between them. At Balaclava, the force waited for supplies while the allied ships bombarded the forts surrounding Sevastopol, starting on 17 October. The forts proved to be particularly strong, but some damage was caused and Admiral Kornilov killed. From then on, <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>again,</b> the allied navy would bombard the forts, causing damage, which the Russians would then repair each night. While the allied armies waited to strengthen their positions and increase their resources, Prince Menshikov, commander of the Russian forces, had a desire to provide a victory to the Tsar following his defeat at Alma. He formed a plan to cut the British army off from the harbour at Balaclava, with a secondary objective of capturing the harbour itself. The Russian forces assembled on 24 October, and attacked at around 7am on the 25th. General Gribbe covered the Russian left flank, with Semiakin, Levoutsky and Scudery on his right: General Ryzhov waited behind them, prepared to support any individual force that came under trouble. The Turkish forces in the first redoubts were quickly overwhelmed and forced to flee.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} Thursday, 22 April, United hosted their longtime rivals, Red Bull New York. Broadcast on ESPN2, it was United's first televised {{match on}} the network this year. In the 12th minute of play, a Luke Rodgers cross to Red Bulls striker, Thierry Henry led to the first goal for New York. Henry scored his third goal of the season, and {{the second of the}} match in the 38th minute of play, doubling New York's lead. Heading into halftime, Olsen replaced club captain, McCarty in for DP, Branko Bošković at halftime. Bošković, praised for his play in the match, had two shots on goal that were deflected off of the crossbar. In the 64th minute, Bošković sent a free kick hurdling towards the upper right post, only to be denied by the crossbar. Throughout a majority of the second half United dominated the Red Bulls in possession, but failed <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>again</b> to score. A counterattack in the 72nd minute, led by Estonian international, Joel Lindpere gave New York a 3–0 advantage over United. Subsequently, Bošković had his third shot on goal deflect off the bar. American prospect, Juan Agudelo netted in injury time for the Red Bulls, giving the club a 4–0 win over United. The loss for United was their worst ever home loss against New York, and their worst loss at home since 2005, when the team lost 4–0 to Chicago Fire in an MLS Cup quarterfinal leg.|$|E

25|$|The Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, is {{the highest}} {{authority}} in the Sikhism, {{it is seen as}} the 11th and eternal Guru.

It is seemingly silent on the subject of homosexuality; however, married life is encouraged <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>again</b> in Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Whenever marriage is mentioned, it is always in reference to a man and a woman. Some Sikhs believe that Guru Granth Sahib Ji is the complete guide to life, and if a marriage between two of the same sexes is not mentioned, it is therefore not right. The counterargument to this is that man and woman are only mentioned in this way to give light to the relationship of the soul and the soul force as being one. This denies gender and sex as an issue. Thus, Sikhism is more concerned with ones attainment of enlightenment rather than habitual desires such as sexuality. True love is attained through the Guru and no man speaks on behalf of the Guru as the Granth is open to interpretation and misrepresentation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{tactic of}} the Ashanti during later wars against the British {{was to create}} {{powerful}} log stockades at key points to block British advances. Some of these fortifications were over a hundred yard long, with heavy parallel tree trunks sometimes impervious to destruction by artillery fire. Behind these stockades numerous warriors were mobilized to check enemy movement. While formidable in construction, many of these strongpoints failed because Ashanti guns, gunpowder and bullets were poor, and provided little sustained killing power in defense. <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>again</b> British troops overcame or bypassed the stockades by mounting old-fashioned bayonet charges, after laying down some covering fire. The Ashanti had given up effective use of traditional weapons like spears, and had little effective reply to the cold steel of an infantry charge except the weak volleys of their obsolete or malfunctioning muskets. Supplementary weapons like bush knives made an indifferent showing in these tactical situations against the European soldiers. The presence of African enemies also fighting alongside the British with their customary tribal arms also added to Ashanti woes. Supposed advanced technology in this case, the gun, became ironically, a handicap for the indigenous forces. By contrast, the Zulu retained the effective use of their traditional spears, generally forcing the British to remain in packed defensive formations or entrenched strongpoints, protected by guns and artillery.|$|E

2500|$|It {{may have}} been that Claudius {{initially}} planned to occupy only the lowland regions of Britain. In the 1st century, the Romans had no clear idea how large the island was.
