50|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> was first described in 1854 by Philippe de Clermont {{at a meeting}} of the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E
50|$|Frequent early {{symptoms}} of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> poisoning are dizziness, headache, weakness, muscle twitching, tremor, abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea and sweating can develop within 4-12 {{hours of the}} contact.|$|E
50|$|Philippe de Clermont (1831-1921) was a French organic chemist. He {{was known}} for the {{synthesis}} of the first organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor (<b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> TEPP). He worked in Adolphe Wurtz's laboratory in Paris.|$|E
50|$|In the {{commercial}} preparation of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> {{it is common}} to use the methods developed by Schrader, Woodstock or Toy. One can carry out the synthesis by reacting triethyl phosphate with phosphorus oxychloride (Schrader-method) or with phosphorus pentoxide (Woodstock-method). One could also synthesize the pure substance by controlled hydrolysis of diethyl phosphorochloridate in a mixture of water and pyridine.|$|E
50|$|Sulfotep is desulfurated {{by either}} {{cytochrome}} P450 or the FAD-containing monooxygenases. In this reaction, the sulfur {{is replaced by}} oxygen, as seen in figure 2. The metabolites formed are monosulfotep and <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (TEPP). To accomplish these reactions, a phospho-oxithirane ring is formed, which is highly reactive. This ring is thought to bind to acetylcholinesterase and cause toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|Sulfotep {{was first}} commercially {{launched}} by BAYER in 1946. It {{is known as}} an organophosphate, which were also used for war efforts by British and German armies before use in agriculture developed. 2 Sulfotep is synthesized by a reaction of TEPP (<b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate)</b> with sulfur. Tepp itself was first synthesized by Philipe de Clermont in 1854., ...|$|E
50|$|Tetraethyl dithiopyrophosphate has toxic {{effects on}} spider mites, mealybugs, whiteflies, and aphids. However, the {{chemical}} is not phytotoxic, unlike <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> However, it occasionally causes minor damage to plants, {{such as the}} slight puckering and cupping of leaves. During several tests in the late 1940s, it {{was found to be}} the most toxic of several chemicals to whiteflies on vegetables, two-spotted spider mites on roses, and mealybugs on numerous plants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> {{abbreviated}} TEPP, is an organophosphate compound, {{which is}} used as an insecticide. This compound is a clear, colorless liquid, which is soluble in water, but hydrolyzes rapidly. There are several mechanism by which TEPP can be synthesized and it was first synthesized by Philippe de Clermont and Muscovite Wladimir Moschnin in 1854. It is a toxic compound, due to its anticholinesterase activity, which not only applies to insects, but also to other animals. TEPP is metabolized {{with the assistance of}} many different enzymes en the metabolistes are excreted via the urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> is a {{very toxic}} organophosphorus ester. In its pure form it is a colourless, {{hygroscopic}} liquid. It is fully miscible with water and various types of organic solvents, except for petroleum based solvents. The liquid evaporates very slowly and hydrolyses very rapidly in water. Because the mechanism for the hydrolysis is first order, the half-lifes were determined to be 7.5 hours at 25 °C and 3.1 hours at 40 °C when dissolved in distilled water. If one heats TEPP it will start to decompose at around 150-200 °C, which produces ethylene gas. Furthermore, acidic fumes of phosphoric acid and carbon monoxide could be formed. At lower temperatures TEPP could form triethylphosphate and ethyl metaphosphates, which are acid catalysed reactions.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} small {{traces of}} other compounds are also {{formed in the}} reaction. It {{is unlikely that the}} ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) {or its isomer} would act as a plant protection agent, but (FcP(S)(NR2)(NCS)) compounds can act as nerve poisons in insects. These compounds bearing terminal sulfur atoms on the phosphorus atom are much less toxic than the compounds (such as sarin, VX and <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate)</b> which have an oxygen in place of this terminal sulfur. This is because the P=S compound is not active as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in either mammals or insects, in mammals the animals metabolism tends to remove lipophilic side groups from the phosphorus atom while an insect tends to oxidise the compound so removing the terminal sulfur and replacing it with a terminal oxygen which causes the compound to be more able to act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|The first {{reported}} synthesis of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> {{was in the}} year 1854. Muscovite Wladimir Moschnin and Philippe de Clermont were the first chemists who synthesized and reported the TEPP synthesis. At that time, both were working at Adolphe Wurtz' laboratory in Paris. The fact that nobody knew anything about the toxicity of TEPP at this time was evidenced by De Clermont himself, who {{reported that he had}} tasted the compound out of curiosity. He described the taste as being a viscous liquid with a burning taste and a peculiar odor ("un liquide visqueux d’une saveur brulante(et) d’une odeur particuliere"). Even though TEPP has repeatedly been synthesized by other chemists during the years that followed, not until the 1930s had any adverse effects been observed. Furthermore, Philippe de Clermont has never been reported ill by his family up to his passing at the age of 90. In the meantime, organophosphorus chemistry has really started developing with the help of A. W. von Hofmann, Carl Arnold August Michaelis and Alecsandr Erminingel'dovich Arbusow.|$|E

These insecticides have become an economic necessity to agriculture. They can be used safely when rigid precautions are utilized and when medical supervision is provided for employees regularly working with these chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Neostigmine is {{at present}} the {{mainstay}} in treatment of myasthenia gravis. Adjuvant therapy with ephedrine, potassium chloride, or guanidine is recommended. Urecholine,® also {{used as an}} adjuvant, {{is still in the}} experimental stage and should only be given by one acquainted with its properties and toxic effects. Di-isopropylfluorophosphate and <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> likewise are still in the experimental stage. Since they are extremely toxic and unstable, general use of them is discouraged until further experimental and therapeutic studies are completed. The results of thymectomy and radiation of the thymus are equivocal and these procedures should be reserved for severe cases which should be selected only after a thorough study...|$|E
40|$|Benzoquinonium (Mytolon) {{has been}} shown to produce a curare-like rather than a decamethonium-like {{paralysis}} of neuromuscular transmission in the tibialis anterior and soleus muscle of cats and the gastrocnemius muscle of hens. In the cat, but not in the hen, benzoquinonium had an additional action in preventing both the twitch potentiating action and the anti-curare action of edrophonium, neostigmine, eserine, and <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> Paralysis produced by benzoquinonium was antagonized by injected acetylcholine and by acetylcholine liberated by tetanic stimulation of the motor nerve but, in the cat, anticholinesterases were without effect even when they were first administered in circumstances in which acetylcholine accumulation might be expected to occur. These findings suggested that inhibition of cholinesterase played little part in the skeletal muscle effects of the anticholinesterases studied. Although anticholinesterases did not antagonize benzoquinonium paralysis in the cat, they nevertheless potentiated the antagonistic action of injected acetylcholine...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance {{has been used}} to study the association of atropine and eserine with acetylchol inesterase extracted from squid head ganglia and synaptosome membranes from rat brain cortex. Line width changes of the N-methyl and phenyl groups of atropine and the N-methyl and C-methyl groups of eserine resulting from association with the enzyme and the synaptosome membranes have been used to study the interactions. The results show that whereas eserine binds at the active site of the enzyme, atropine binds at a site distinct from the active center. Further proof that the binding sites of the two ligands are distinct from each other was obtained by showing that the antichol inesterase, <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (TEPP) diminished the binding of eserine but not of atropine. The effect of pH, ionic strength and TEPP on the binding of synaptosome membranes was similar to the results obtained with soluble acetylchol inesterase. This indicates that both ligands bind to the synaptosome membrane bound acetylcholinesterase. The significance of the non-catalytic site on acetylchol inesterase in relation to the acetylcholine receptor is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} this {{laboratory}} (DuBois, Doull and Coon, 1950) {{have shown that}} cholinergic pyrophosphates with amidophosphate linkages have certain distinctive pharmacologic properties. Thus, octamethyl pyrophosphor-amide (OMPA), which contains amidophosphate linkages {{in place of the}} alkoxy groups present in most cholinergic organic phosphates, exerts a selective action on peripheral tissues in vivo after conversion to an active metabolite in the liver. In addition, this organic phosphate is very stable in aqueous solutions. The symmetrical and unsymmetrical analogs of diethyl bis(dimethylamido) pyro-phosphate, which contain two of the ethoxy groups of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (TEPP) and two of the dimethylamido groups of OMPA, resemble the latter compound in their pharmacologic effects and physical properties (DuBois et at., 1953). Considerable interest has been manifested in the potential thera-peutic value of stable cholinergic organic phosphates which inhibit the cholines-terase activity of peripheral tissues without affecting brain cholinesterase. It was, therefore, of interest to extend our investigations to ascertain whether the presence of amidophosphate linkages modifies the action of cholinergic fluorophosphates. For the present investigation bis(dimethylamido) fluoro-phosphate (BFP) was employed. This compound has the following chemical structur...|$|E
40|$|TRIOLO, ANTHONY J. AND J. M. COON: The {{protective}} effect of aldrin against the toxicity of organophosphate anticholinesterases. J. Pharmac. exp. Ther. 154 : 613 â€” 623, 1966. A single oral dose of 16 mg/kg of aldrin protected mice 4 days later against parathion, paraoxon, <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0 -ethyl 0 -p-nitrophenylphosphor othioate, Guthion, tri-o-tolylphosphate and physostigmine, but not against octamethyl py rophosphoramide (OMPA) or neostigmine. One hour after aldrin, the toxicity of parathion was increased, whereas, from 16 hr to 12 days after aidrin, animals were significantly pro tected. This effect of aldrin reached its maximum in about 4 days, and 1 mg/kg provided significant protection. Two days after aidrin, A-esterase, which detoxifies paraoxon, in creased 38 % {{in the liver}} but decreased 50 % in the plasma, and plasma B-esterase, which is inhibited by paraoxon, was increased 24 %. Aldrin {{had no effect on}} the inhibitory action of paraoxon on plasma cholinesterase, but it reduced this action of paraoxon in the brain. This is in accord with the finding that aldrin failed to protect against OMPA or neostigmine, which differ from the other anticholinesterases tested in being poor in vivo inhibitors of brai...|$|E
40|$|An O‐(saccharinylmethyl) prodrug was {{synthesized}} {{to improve}} the poor oral potency of the phenolic drug 17 β‐estradiol. This O‐(imidomethyl) type of prodrug was designed to undergo chemical hydrolysis {{and to be a}} poor substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis. At 37 °C, it was found to exhibit half‐lives of about 13 min in 50 % methanol:pH 7. 0 (v/v) phosphate buffer, about 3 min in rat plasma, about 15 min in human plasma, and about 50 min in 20 % rat liver homogenate. Introduction of the enzyme poison <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> or the protein denaturant sodium fluoride into rat plasma had no significant effect on the half‐life. Thus, the observed increased rate of hydrolysis in biological media is not due to enzymatic catalysis but to a nonspecific solventlike effect. The fact that the rate of hydrolysis in the methanol:buffer exhibited a first‐order dependence on the hydroxide ion concentration and that the rate of hydrolysis increased with increasing methanol concentrations up to 70 % supported an S 2 mechanism of hydrolysis for the prodrug. These results suggest that an O‐(imidomethyl) type prodrug is insensitive to enzymatic catalysis of hydrolysis yet may hydrolyze quickly enough to release 17 β‐estradiol faster than 17 β‐estradiol is conjugated and excreted.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Substrate and {{inhibitor}} specificities {{have been}} used to classify esterases. The purpose of this work was to determine the substrate and inhibitor specificities of the esterases in an aquous extract of lyophilyzed carrots. Esterase activity was determined manometrically at 37 °C. The optimum pH of the carrot esterases with several substrates varied from 6. 8 to 7. 2, and a pH of 7. 2 was used in this study. The carrot extract hydrolyzed acetyl, propionyl and butyryl esters of phenol, 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na and glycerol. As the acyl chain length was increased, activity decreased. Long-chain naphthyl esters and triolein were not hydrolyzed, which suggested the absence of lipase in the extract. Lack of activity with choline esters indicated the absence of cholinesterases. EDTA did not exhibit appreciable activation of carrot esterases. The effect of parathion, diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP) and <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (TEPP) at various concentrations on the rate of hydrolysis of the acetyl, propionyl and butyryl esters, of phenol, 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na and glycerol indicated the presence of six esterases. Inhibitor and substrate specificities of five esterases were similar to carboxylesterases (EC 3. 1. 1. 1). The sixth esterase was similar to arylester as e (EC 3. 1. 1. 2). An enzyme hydrolyzing DFP and TEPP was suggested in the carrot extract...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} differentiate the esterases in a water extract of freeze-dried green beans {{on the basis of}} inhibitor and substrate specificities. An attempt was made to classify these esterases according to the criteria used for animal esterases. Activity of the esterases was measured manometrically using the Gilson differential respirometer. Aqueous extracts of green beans were found to hydrolyze the acetyl, propionyl, and n-butyryl esters of glycerol, phenol, and 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na. No hydrolysis of triolein or long-chain 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na esters was noted, indicating the absence of lipases. A small amount of activity was observed when the choline esters served as substrates, but this was attributed to esterases other than cholinesterases. Optimum activity of the extract on triacetin, tripropion, tributyrin, phenyl acetate, and phenyl propionate occurred at pH 7. 2. The effects of organophosphorus inhibitors, diethyl p-nitrophenyl thiophosphate, <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate, at concentrations ranging from 10 ⁻¹ M to 10 ⁻¹⁰ M on the esterase activity was studied. These data show that the green bean extract contains at least three esterases. One was resistant to certain organophosphorus compounds, suggesting similarity to animal arylesterases (aryl ester hydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 2). Various concentrations of organophosphorus compounds inhibited the activity of the two other esterases. These were classified as carboxylesterases (carboxylic ester hydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Although esterases {{have been}} {{reported}} in peas, their properties have not been studied. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the substrate and inhibitor specificity of the esterases present in a water extract of lyophilized peas, and to determine if pea esterases could be classified according to the criteria established for animal esterases. Esterase activity was determined manometrically using the Gilson differential respirometer. The effect of pH on esterase activity was determined using phenyl acetate, phenyl propionate, tripropionin, and tributyrin as substrates. The pH optima appeared to lie between 6. 9 and 7. 2, and pH 7 was selected for use in this study. The acetyl, propionyl, and n-butyryl esters of phenol, 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃ Na and glycerol were hydrolyzed by the enzyme extract. Long chain esters of 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na, however, were not hydrolyzed. Cholinesterases and lipases {{did not appear to be}} present in the extract since only a very small amount of activity was observed when the choline esters and triolein were used as substrates. Using phenyl propionate and phenyl butyrate as substrates, esterase activity, based on the original extract, decreased with dilution. Later work revealed that the esterase(s) which hydrolyzed phenyl propionate were inhibited by heavy metal ions and activated by metal complexing agents. Hence, a possible explanation for the decrease in activity was inhibition by metal ions in the distilled water. The effects of the inhibitors parathion, <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate at concentrations ranging from 10 ⁻¹ M to 10 ⁻¹⁰ M on esterase activity were determined. The data suggested the presence of as many as six esterases in the aqueous extract of peas, three for which the evidence was quite conclusive. On the basis of their inhibition by organophosphorus compounds, all but one of the esterases appeared to be of the B type. Physostigmine sulfate (10 ⁻⁵ M) had no effect on esterase activity with the nine substrates used indicating that the activity was not due to cholinesterases. At least one of the esterases which hydrolyzed each of the substrates was sensitive to 10 ⁻³ M p-chloromercuribenzoic acid sodium salt suggesting the importance of sulfhydryl groups for enzyme activity...|$|E
