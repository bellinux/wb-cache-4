5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|Polonium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though its metallic character {{resembles that of}} its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table: thallium, lead, and bismuth. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138days) in uranium ores, {{as it is the}} penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.|$|E
5|$|Nicolas Roeg had {{employed}} the fractured editing style of Don't Look Now on his previous films, Performance and Walkabout, {{but it was}} originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg. Roeg's use of colour—especially red—can {{be traced back to}} earlier work: both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it—along with the whole screen—turn completely red. The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character. <b>The</b> <b>fleeting</b> glimpses of the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings pack painful memories of his lost love.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer, containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was founded}} as the Sewanee Furnace Company, a small mining concern {{established}} in 1852 by Nashville entrepreneurs seeking to exploit Tennessee's rich coal reserves and the 19th century railroad boom. After losing money, {{the business was}} sold to New York investors in 1859 and reorganized as the Tennessee Coal and Rail Company, but {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War the following year saw <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> company repossessed by local creditors. It became Tennessee's leading coal extractor over the next decade, mining and transporting coal around the towns of Cowan and Tracy City in the Cumberland Mountains, and soon branched out into coke manufacture. This practice of both extracting and moving coal to market by building private rail tracks was not unusual at the time, as by owning the tracks that served their mines, businesses could undercut rivals at market by saving money on transportation. A Thomas O'Connor purchased the company in 1876 and expanded the business into iron manufacture in order to stimulate coke sales, building a blast furnace near Cowan. The business was subsequently renamed the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company. TCI never again changed its name, despite a later expansion into Alabama following the 1886 purchase of the Birmingham-based Pratt Coal and Iron Company. Such was the industrial importance of Alabama to TCI that in 1895, the company relocated its offices to Birmingham, relegating its native state to relative unimportance.|$|E

25|$|Several special filming {{techniques}} were devised to obtain {{some of the}} footage of rare and elusive animals. One cameraman spent hundreds of hours waiting for <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> moment when a rare frog, which incubates its young in its mouth, finally spat them out. Another built a replica of a mole rat burrow in a horizontally mounted wheel, so that as the mole rat ran along the tunnel, the wheel could be spun to keep the animal adjacent to the camera. To illustrate the motion of bats' wings in flight, a slow motion sequence was filmed in a wind tunnel. The series {{was also the first}} to include footage of a live (although dying) coelacanth.|$|E
25|$|The art of {{the ancient}} Near East, and also in archaic Greece, used only the frontal and profile view. Only {{classical}} Greek style introduced an intermediate step, especially the three-quarter view. Representations of the classical Greeks tried the illusion of life in all its forms. The characters are totally preoccupied with themselves and ignore the viewer. The frontal view is also found here, but {{is only one of}} many possibilities. Parthian art certainly took over the frontal view of Hellenistic art, but it appears the Parthians in their art again took recourse with the presence of the Ancient Orient. The Parthian art is not an illusion and tried to capture <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> nature of life. Rather, they tried to give the figures durability. They tried to capture the true content of life and not just the outer shell. The effect of such methods is often that the viewer feels transcended.|$|E
25|$|Raids {{continued}} at intervals during the winter, {{with the gun}} sites reporting a few successes, and several near misses from bombs. At various times the regiment was reinforced by troops and batteries from the neighbouring 19 LAA Rgt (60, 104 and 290 AA Btys) and 7 Canadian LAA Rgt (F Trp). When 19 LAA Rgt departed for mobile training {{at the end of}} February 1943, 60 Bty was replaced under 131 LAA Rgt's operational control by 230 Bty from 138 LAA Rgt. Early that month, 463 S/L Bty of 71 S/L Rgt arrived to man Vickers K machine guns (8 twins each at Hastings, St Leonards, Bexhill and Eastbourne) under command of 131 LAA Rgt, followed by reinforcements of the same regiment's 462 S/L Bty later in the month. 131 LAA Regiment was also reinforced by six flights of the RAF Regiment equipped with Beaverette armoured cars, and later other flights with 20mm guns. Anti-Aircraft Barrage balloons were positioned round the vulnerable towns. In March 131 LAA Rgt's defences around Pevensey and Hastings were further increased by 320 Bty of 93 LAA Rgt, which had been borrowed by AA Command from 42nd Armoured Division in December and positioned between Brighton and Seaford. In addition, the local heavy AA unit at Newhaven, 179 (Mixed) HAA Rgt, was trained by 131 LAA Rgt to operate extra Bofors guns against <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> targets of opportunity that the Luftwaffe fighter-bombers presented.|$|E

500|$|Scholar Andy Orchard {{posits that}} Bifröst may mean [...] "shimmering path."

Austrian Germanist Rudolf Simek says that Bifröst either means [...] "the swaying road to heaven" [...] (also citing bifa) or, if Bilröst is the {{original}} form of the two (which Simek says is likely), [...] "the fleetingly glimpsed rainbow" [...] (possibly connected to bil, perhaps meaning [...] "moment, weak point").|$|E
500|$|William Plomer, {{writing in}} The Spectator after the book's first publication, thought it mistaken [...] "to regard Mr Waugh's more {{surprising}} situations as farcical or far-fetched; {{they are on}} the whole extremely realistic". However, the mixture of genres was not immediately understood or appreciated by some of Waugh's admirers; Connolly's initial thought was that Waugh had been [...] "destroyed as a writer", by snobbery and association with country-house living. In Sykes's view, <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> appearances in the book of characters from Waugh's farcical world, such as Lady Metroland, are awkward and intrusive—the world of A Handful of Dust is not outlandish: [...] "Evelyn would have done better to have forgotten Lady Metroland and her world altogether".|$|E

500|$|Andersen {{retained}} story {{ideas in}} his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life, and telling stories such as “The Snowman” was a compulsion with him. The tale {{has been described as}} poignant and lyrical, and as a self-mocking autobiographical revelation in which Andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning, unreciprocated pain, and that he would end his life partnerless and alone. The light-hearted Snowman is a complement to Andersen’s tragic Fir Tree and, in telling the tale, Andersen returns “to his earlier, tragicomic mode of sketching <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have caught his eye at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form.” ...|$|E
500|$|The poem {{starts with}} a {{flattering}} question to the beloved—"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"

[...] However, the beloved has beauty that will last forever, unlike <b>the</b> <b>fleeting</b> beauty of a summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever. [...] "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
