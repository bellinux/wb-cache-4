5|$|In September 1765, Adams {{was once}} again {{appointed}} by the Boston <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> to write the instructions for Boston's delegation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly. James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author {{of a series of}} House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than those passed by the Stamp Act Congress. Adams {{was one of the first}} colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights that governments could not violate.|$|E
5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} on a political career {{with the support of}} the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E

5000|$|On June 5, 1781, a {{constitutional}} convention was convened and began writing the state's new constitution. In the Spring of 1782, {{a draft of}} the constitution was sent to <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> for ratification. During the <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> there were substantial proposed amendments that the Constitution was redrafted by the Convention and resubmitted to <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> in Fall 1782. The second draft of the 1782 Constitution was met with even more proposed amendments. A third draft was necessary before it was resubmitted and accepted in the <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> [...] "as is." [...] In Spring 1783, a requisite number of <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> ratified the third draft and it became effective June 2, 1784. On October 31, 1783, the constitution was established and the Convention adjourned sine die, after having declared the constitution ratified.|$|R
5|$|Learning that British {{troops were}} on the way, the Boston <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> met on September 12, 1768 and {{requested}} that Governor Bernard convene the General Court. Bernard refused, so the <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> called on the other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22. About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending military occupation violated Bostonians' natural, constitutional, and charter rights. By {{the time that the}} convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor. Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November.|$|E

5|$|A <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> is held {{to discuss}} Mr. Burns' actions. Mr. Burns arrives, {{armed with a}} gun after his {{encounter}} with Homer. Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. He walks into an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is heard. He stumbles out into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, just about anyone {{could have been the}} shooter.|$|E

5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{returned}} to Massachusetts in November 1774, {{where he served}} in the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, an extralegal legislative body independent of British control. The Provincial Congress created the first minutemen companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment's notice. Adams also served as moderator of the Boston <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting,</b> which convened despite the Massachusetts Government Act, and was appointed to the Committee of Inspection to enforce the Continental Association. He was also selected to attend the Second Continental Congress, scheduled to meet in Philadelphia in May 1775.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{worked to}} {{coordinate}} {{resistance to the}} Coercive Acts. In May 1774, the Boston <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> (with Adams serving as moderator) organized an economic boycott of British goods. In June, Adams headed a committee in the Massachusetts House—with the doors locked to prevent Gage from dissolving the legislature—which proposed that an inter-colonial congress meet in Philadelphia in September. He was one of five delegates chosen to attend the First Continental Congress. Adams was never fashionably dressed and had little money, so friends bought him new clothes and paid his expenses for the journey to Philadelphia, his first trip outside of Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|Deliberative {{sessions}} are less well attended, in bodies that have adopted SB-2, than are plenary <b>Town</b> <b>Meetings</b> in bodies {{that have not}} adopted SB-2, as their decisions are not final. However, the final vote by secret ballot attracts more voters than <b>Town</b> <b>Meetings</b> do because of the shorter time requirement, and absentees can vote.|$|R

50|$|<b>Town</b> <b>meetings</b> {{also became}} more {{important}} in local political life. As towns grew, the townspeople became more assertive in managing their affairs. Town selectmen had previously wielded significant power, but they lost some of their influence to the <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> and to the appointment of paid town employees, such as tax assessors, constables, and treasurers.|$|R
5|$|After {{being caught}} by the Environmental Protection Agency dumping nuclear waste in the city park, Mr. Burns is fined $3 million. A <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> is held so that the {{citizens}} can decide how to spend the money. Marge suggests that the city {{use the money to}} fix Main Street, which is in poor condition. The town is about to vote in favor when someone new to town, a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley, suggests that Springfield construct a city monorail. After being swayed by a song, the now enthused townspeople decide to build the monorail.|$|E

It was resettled in 1821, its early <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> {{held in a}} local tavern. In 1846 a combination church and town hall was built, providing space for both <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> and the local Congregationalists. That building was destroyed by fire in 1904. The present building was completed in 1912 {{on the site of}} the previous hall. It has been home to <b>town</b> <b>meetings</b> and social gatherings since then; the town's offices, which were never located in the previous building, are located in a different building constructed in 1990.|$|R
5|$|The saloon keepers, who {{received}} word that Hobbs {{was accompanied by}} law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival, greeted her by dressing up the town with bunting, blue and pink ribbons, and flowers. A <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> was arranged at 2:30 p.m. on January 3. Hobbs renewed the call for the resignation of city officials, but the request was refused. Hobbs' escorts then arrested the city leaders and ordered Lawson to declare martial law. It {{was the first time}} in Oregon since the Civil War that martial law was put into effect.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not {{in session}} when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams {{therefore}} used the Boston <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same. By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott. Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, a series of popular essays by John Dickinson which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such a wide audience.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{subsequently}} given by Henry II to Thomas Becket {{when he became}} chancellor in 1155. Becket extended the castle to accommodate his large household, but fell from favour in 1164 and the castle was confiscated by the king. Henry II liked Berkhamsted and subsequently used it himself extensively. By the mid-12th century, the castle had been rebuilt in stone, probably by Becket, with a shell keep and an outer stone wall; the bailey was divided in two by a wall to form an inner and an outer bailey. A gatehouse led down into the <b>town,</b> <b>meeting</b> with Castle Street. Henry II also officially recognised the surrounding settlement of Berkhamsted as a town in 1156.|$|E

5|$|According to Morgan, {{the town}} hall was {{designed}} for multiple uses and this {{is evident from the}} plans and the exterior of the building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a <b>town</b> <b>meeting</b> room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to {{the town hall}} were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{was born}} in Boston, {{brought up in a}} {{religious}} and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston <b>Town</b> <b>Meeting</b> in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the Boston Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution {{at the expense of the}} colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution.|$|E

The mob arrives at the house and immediately starts destroying things. Bart and Homer arrive and Homer decides to try to convince the mob to stop. He does so by singing a musical number accompanied by Belle and some of her dancers. The town soon joins in and are convinced to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a bulldozer, having missed the song. The town announces their intentions to let the house stay, but Marge tries to sing her own song about her views. During the opening lines, she accidentally puts the bulldozer into drive and destroys a wing of the burlesque house. She apologizes profusely and, to pay for the damage, she starts a ventriloquist act at the house.|$|E
