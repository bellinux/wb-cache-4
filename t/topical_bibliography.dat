The PIC searches 11 worldwide databases to obtain all published nonhuman primate literature, which is then indexed using the PICÃ Â¢ s detailed thesaurus, into a computer database. The database currently holds over 90, 000 records dating back to 1940 and is used for custom retrospective searches or monthly recurrent searches for individual researchers/veterinarians. This Ã Â¢ PrimatesÃ Â¢ database is also available for individual/institution use on an IBM-PC compatible format. The PIC publishes a monthly bibliographic reference Current Primate References as well as <b>topical</b> <b>bibliographies.</b> Other services of the PIC include the Primate Supply Information Clearinghouse (PSIC), a communication network between research institutions, zoos, biotechnology companies, etc. for the sharing of non-human primates and their tissues, equipment, and information to minimize the number of animals used and decrease the use of wild-caught animals. The PSIC publishes a twice-monthly bulletin New Listings, {{as well as providing}} a referral service. Details of the development, operation, and maintenance of the PIC database and search capabilities will be demonstrated.

40|$|The International Information System for the Agricultural Sciences and Technology (AGRIS) {{is one of}} the world's largest {{agricultural}} informat~on {{systems and}} the only one which has tried to give equal emphasis to the needs of developing and developed countries. It became operational in 1975 and now consists of 128 national and 18 regional or international centres. As a 'mission-oriented' organization, the scope of AGRIS is very broad, covering not only all aspects of agricultural development, but rural development and sociology, training and extension, nutrition and even pollution when it is caused by or affects agricultural production. The basic keyword in defining AGRIS is 'cooperative'. Each national centre is encouraged to submit bibliographic data originating from within its borders in return for access to the entire AGRIS data base. Although a cost-effective mechanism for collecting documents on a global scale, the weakness {{lies in the fact that}} if some countries do not or cannot contribute, their information is lost to other users. AGRIS is coordinated by FAO through the AGRIS Coordinating Centre (ACC) located in Rome with a Processing Unit at the IAEA in Vienna. Every two years a Technical Consultation is held to which all AGRIS participants are invited. The recommendations of this session form the basis for the operations and development of the system. When AGRIS was founded many developing countries who became members had no suitable infrastructure for making agricultural information available within their borders, let alone outside. By insisting on reciprocity in providing information, AGRIS catalyzed the development of national capabilities to develop and use agricultural information The main working tool of AGRIS is the Agrindex which is now printed in French, Spanish and English. There are also cumulative indexes and Agrindex abstracts on microfiche. The AGRIS magnetic tape distribution service, an on-line system for searching from remote locations, and the SDI service round out the ist of standard services. Special products include national and <b>topical</b> <b>bibliographies.</b> AGRIS also has an extensive training programme. In order to overcome the problems inherent in simplified indexing and to increase accessibility to users in non-English speaking countries, a joint AGRIS/CEC project has resulted in the development of a multilingual thesaurus called AGROVOC. It not only makes multilingual searching of the data base possible but for the first time, it provides a true subject index. AGRIS has always emphasized its relationship with the developing world, and has had particular success in Asia and Latin America. Although the situation has recently improved, only about half of the ACP countries are now participating actively. To date, they have contributed only one third of one percent of the data currently available in the system. If input to the system is one way of gauging the benefits being obtained from it, we must assume that ACP countries, at least in the past, have made very little use of AGRIS. Communication barriers must have prevented many ACP countries from playing a more active role in AGRIS. As noted above, a French edition of Agrindex is now being published and should make a substantial contribution to the use of AGRIS in francophone countries. Work is also pro greasing on an AGRIS CDROM which should be particularly useful for ACP countries. The recent emergence of regional AGRIS networks in the Caribbean and Pacific regions is also an encouraging sign. We in AGRIS are now looking forward to a period of increasing agricultural information activity in ACP countries. CTA is taking an active part in making new ideas and methods a reality in these countries and the AGRIS family will do what it can to support such activities. For more details, contact: A.

40|$|About this {{bibliography}} This bibliography was {{put together}} by sifting through countless assessment resources {{in order to find}} the very best. It is not complete, but it is substantial; additional citations will be introduced periodically to keep the bibliography up to date and fresh. The bibliography will grow as assessment scholarship evolves and as our need for new and different kinds of resources develops. Articles were chosen based on accessibility, concision, readability, thoughtfulness, and relevance. ASSESSMENT For the purposes of this <b>topical</b> <b>bibliography,</b> I have organized the resources into 10 different sections. The entries are alphabetized within each section, and (apart from section 9) MLA style is used. If you have trouble locating any of the sources or locate any dead links, incorrect data, or errors, please let me know. I have included links to articles whenever possible, even if the link differs from the original citation (or from a database link). Fragments are used intentionally in source summaries. Finally, this bibliography was compiled with Writing Studies faculty in mind, but many of the resources are relevant to any department working on assessment.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{traditional}} social organization, art, and technology of the Northwest Coast Indians whose settlements stretch from the state of Washington, through British Columbia, and into southern Alaska. In this volume, writer-photographer Ruth Kirk summarizes the historic and present-day culture of four native groups in the southern part of this region: the Makah, Southern Kwakiutl, and people who call themselves Nuu-chah-nulth and Nuxalk. Until recently, the latter two groups were referred to, respectively, as the Nootka and the Bella Coola. Kirk 2 ̆ 7 s task, undertaken with the sponsorship of the Royal British Columbia Museum, was to update information in older publications and present it in a popular format for the general public. In addition to utilizing previously published data, Kirk drew upon the expertise of contemporary linguists, ethnologists, archaeologists, and most importantly-many native elders. Kirk emphasizes that the elders bring a 2 ̆ 2 sense of place and past 2 ̆ 2 to our understanding since these people are a 2 ̆ 2 bridge across time. 2 ̆ 2 Numerous first-person accounts and portraits of living individuals bring an exciting and dynamic dimension to this book which is handsomely illustrated with copious photographs, line drawings, and color plates. Specialists may be disappointed that there are no footnotes or citations within the text; there is, however, a selected, <b>topical,</b> <b>bibliography</b> which will allow the non-specialist to delve further into the rich literature on the subject...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes the use {{of fiction}} as models to enhance the process of impact assessment (IA) and {{to improve the quality}} of IA reports. It demonstrates that works of extrapolative fiction (EF), a subset of science fiction, raise issues and clarify concerns not currently included in the IA process, suggesting the potential for improving the relevance of IA results for decisionmakers. The dissertation also demonstrates that EF stories can enhance the presentation of IA results, making those results more readable. Through literature review and content analysis, the current IA process is shown to lead to results lacking in specific content areas (e. g., effects on emotional well-being and community cohesiveness) necessary for their utility to decisionmakers. The body of literature here called extrapolative fiction is then shown to include many content areas missing in existing assessments. Two alternatives for an IA process that could incorporate extrapolative fiction are presented and discussed by means of examples. The first includes existing EF stories as a part of or an appendage to an IA report. The example is a preliminary combining of published EF stories with an IA report concerning life-extending technologies. The second includes {{the use of}} existing EF stories in the assessment process through inclusion of an EF-oriented reader on the IA team. The example is a case description of an IA process regarding the commercialization of guayule as a source of natural rubber, a process in which the author incorporated EF methods. Severa other results emerged from this research: (a) an initial statement of objectives for a unified field of impact assessment (recently emerging as an amalgamation of technology assessment, environmental impact statements and social impact assessment); (b) a working definition for an emerging subgenre of science fiction here called extrapolative fiction; (c) a <b>topical</b> <b>bibliography</b> of some hundred EF stories. These results extend the current understanding of the field of impact assessment and the emerging genre of extrapolative fiction and should be useful to both the impact assessment and science fiction criticism communities...|$|E
