5|$|Farther {{north in}} Rhode Island, 10,000people fled from the coast. Despite {{evacuation}} orders, {{nearly half of}} the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result martial law was implemented <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E

500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people's</b> attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tacticsâ€”the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic <b>to</b> <b>get</b> noticed. [...] "Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people's</b> attention, and we're not afraid to do that. We'll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going," [...] said McDermott.|$|R

5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing {{at the front}} {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{needed a}} way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to Monte Ne. In 1900, {{there were few}} {{adequate}} roads, and automobiles were not yet practical. The natural solution seemed to be to build a railroad from Lowell, Arkansas to Monte Ne. The Arkansas Railroad Commission granted a charter on April 26, 1902, and the Monte Ne Railway Company was incorporated in May 1902, with a capital stock of $250,000. Besides Harvey, the company included: Carl A. Starck, P. G. Davidson, A. L. Williams, B. R. Davidson, J. H. McIlroy, J. W. Kimmons, F. F. Freeman, J. F. Felker, Robert H. Harven and Thomas W. Harvey (Coin's brother). Another of Harvey's brothers, a banker at Huntington, West Virginia, furnished $25,000. Of the 250 shares in the company, 240 were registered in Harvey's name. The five-mile (8km) private railroad spur started at the Lowell transfer station. Fourteen thousand oak railway ties were laid running through Cross Hollows, south of Rogers, where two ravines met. It then passed through Limedale, terminating above Big Spring Lake at a log cabin depot with open-air waiting rooms. Harvey leased an engine, a tender, and a passenger coach from the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad. The railway opened on June 19, 1902. Harvey imported a 50-foot (15m) gondola from Venice in July 1901 to meet guests arriving by rail and carry them to the resort.|$|E

25|$|Knievel's daredevil show {{broke up}} after the Barstow {{performance}} because injuries prevented him from performing. After recovering, Knievel started traveling from small town to small town as a solo act. To get ahead of other motorcycle stunt people who were jumping animals or pools of water, Knievel started jumping cars. He began adding more and more cars to his jumps when {{he would return to}} the same venue <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to come out and see him again. Knievel had not had a serious injury since the Barstow performance, but on June 19 in Missoula, Montana, he attempted to jump twelve cars and a cargo van. The distance he had for takeoff did not allow him to get up enough speed. His back wheel hit the top of the van while his front wheel hit the top of the landing ramp. Knievel ended up with a severely broken arm and several broken ribs. The crash and subsequent stay in the hospital were a publicity windfall.|$|E

While in the kitchen alone, an unseen man enters and he and Kat have a sexual encounter. She feels guilty {{the next day and}} attempts to neglect calls and texts from the mystery man, who has bought her a new phone. Kat eventually responds and talks with the man to tell him to leave her alone, but changes her mind and they begin a frequent affair, and he supplies them with a flat to use. Kat endeavours several times to end it, but she continuously succumbs. He falls in love with her, with Kat reciprocating, and when he sends Kat flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious. Kat lies they are from Charlie, but Alfie does not believe her and asks her to be totally honest, to which Kat reveals her three-month affair, telling him he does not know the other man. Alfie is furious and throws her out. After a heart-to-heart with Michael, Kat returns to The Queen Victoria to ask for Alfie's forgiveness and suggests going away for a while.|$|E

500|$|The {{ice cream}} sparked {{debate in the}} Los Angeles Times, when food writer Noelle Carter {{described}} bacon ice cream as perfection but the health section put up {{a photograph of a}} heart bypass and the headline [...] "Bacon ice cream.

The Delaware [...] "Udder Delight" [...] ice cream maker, Chip Hearn, who made bacon ice cream appears to have done so partly as a gimmick <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> into his shop, since he allows customers to taste any flavour in the store. He felt that his flavours differentiated him from the many other parlours on the shore and many people come in to try bacon ice cream only to buy something else.|$|E
500|$|She {{explained}} that {{in developing the}} relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be realâ€“ not some stunt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> talking. We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind ofâ€” I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too.
