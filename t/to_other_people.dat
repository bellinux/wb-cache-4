5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|After Thomas Percy was {{executed}} for rebelling against HenryIV, Wressle Castle passed into royal control. With occasional periods {{when it was}} granted <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> the castle was mostly under royal control until 1471 when it was returned to the Percy family. Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, refurbished the castle and gardens, bringing them to the standard of royal properties.|$|E

5|$|Mi defensa, 1843. This was Sarmiento's first {{autobiography}} in {{a pamphlet}} form, which omits any substantial information or {{recognition of his}} illegitimate daughter Ana. This would have discredited Sarmiento as a respected father of Argentina, as Sarmiento portrays himself as a sole individual, disregarding or denouncing important ties <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> and groups in his life.|$|E
5|$|Shilts {{praised the}} Public Health Department of San Francisco's {{handling}} of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who had symptoms, although {{some of them were}} living {{in different parts of the}} country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director David Sencer refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.|$|E
5|$|The Guayaquil conference {{took place}} on 26 July 1822. They had two private meetings, on that day and the {{following}} one. As there were no witnesses or minutes, {{the content of their}} discussions can only be inferred from their later actions and their letters <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> Some likely topics of discussion may have been a request of reinforcements, and an offer to combine the armies into a single one, with San Martín ranked second to Bolívar.|$|E

5|$|The {{remainder}} of Night describes Eliezer's efforts {{not to be}} parted from his father, not even {{to lose sight of}} him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father's decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and the young man becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father's existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer's need to survive, the weaker the bonds that tie him <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

25|$|Perth's {{economy has}} been {{changing}} in favour of the service industries since the 1950s.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{complicated}} problems that exist within these anti-transgender themes.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behavior. Some people cross-dress as a matter of comfort or style, out of personal preference for clothing associated with the opposite sex. In this case, a person's cross-dressing {{may or may not be}} apparent <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> Some people cross-dress to shock others or challenge social norms.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics are}} {{skeptical of the}} healing power of psychotherapeutic relationships.

25|$|Similarly, for Emmanuel Levinas, God is ethics, so one {{is brought}} closer to God when justice is {{rendered}} to the Other. This means that one experiences {{the presence of}} God through one’s relation <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> To know God is to know what must be done, so {{it does not make}} sense to speak of God as what God is, but rather what God commands.|$|E
