40|$|Privacy {{is defined}} as <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> control, <b>edit,</b> manage, and delete {{information}} about oneself and decide when, how, {{and to what extent}} this information is communicated to others. Therefore, every person should ideally be empowered to manage and protect his own data, individually and independently of others. This assumption, however, barely holds in practice, because people are by nature biologically and socially interconnected. An individual’s identity is essentially determined at the biological and social levels. First, a person is biologically determined by his DNA, his genes, that fully encode his physical characteristics. Second, human beings are social animals, with a strong need to create ties and interact with their peers. Interdependence is present at both levels. At the biological level, interdependence stems from genetic inheritance. At the social level, interdependence emerges from social ties. In this thesis, we investigate whether, in today’s highly connected world, individual privacy is in fact achievable, or if it is almost impossible due to the inherent interdependence between people. First, we study interdependent privacy risks at the social level, focusing on onlin...|$|R

5000|$|While {{chief of}} staff, Brennan {{negotiated}} the 1977 Nixon Interviews with British journalist David Frost; the interviews paid Nixon $600,000, equal to approximately $2 million in 2009. Brennan was initially concerned because Frost had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>edit</b> the interview tapes however he wanted, and could thus edit {{them to change}} the focus of what was said and potentially make Nixon look bad; however, {{he was able to}} relax his concerns upon getting to know Frost. The initial 24 hours of recorded interviews did not go well for either side: Frost's side did not gain any new, meaningful information on the Watergate scandal, while Nixon's side realized they had not offered anything that would begin to repair his shattered reputation. Frost's producer, John Birt, approached Brennan about extending the interview. Brennan originally turned the idea down, but after discussing the situation with his staff, agreed that Nixon should voluntarily go further and that some expression of regret for Watergate needed to be put on record. Nixon himself was resistant to the idea. Brennan explained to him [...] "if this ends the way it has, {{the world is going to}} say, there goes the same old Nixon." [...] Nixon was eventually convinced to offer one more additional interviewing session; in the time in between, Brennan observed Nixon prepare himself for a difficult statement that would not be a confession or an admission of guilt, yet would express regret for what had happened. However, once the final interview began, Nixon became resistant again. Concerned that the interviews would again be disappointing, Brennan held up a hand-written notice to Frost that read [...] "Let him talk." [...] Frost misread the sign as [...] "Let us talk" [...] and called for a break. During the short interval, Nixon's team persuaded him to overcome his reticence and make a statement of regret; Frost, meanwhile, was persuaded to take a more sympathetic tone. On return from the break, Frost coaxed Nixon into conceding that he had participated in the cover up and lied to the world about it, and that he had [...] "let the American people down." [...] Frost's top researcher, Robert Zelnick, credited the moment to Nixon's staff.|$|E
