5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium {{has not received}} much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to be}} a noble metal. Based on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + is expected to be more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{reference}} genes {{were investigated}} for normalization of gene expression {{data in the}} shell gland of laying hens. Analyses performed with geNorm revealed that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT 1) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> reference genes in response to post-oviposition time alone (POT) or with nicarbazin treatment (POT+N) of laying hens. NormFinder analyses showed that <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> reference genes in response to POT and POT+N were 18 S ribosomal RNA (18 S rRNA), ribosomal protein L 4 (RPL 4) and HMBS, RPL 4, respectively. BestKeeper analyses showed that 18 S rRNA, RPL 4 and HPRT 1, HMBS were <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> reference genes for POT, and POT+N, respectively. Of the ten reference genes, all except B 2 M showed geNorm M < 0. 5, suggesting that they were stably expressed in the shell gland tissue. Consensus from these three programs suggested HPRT 1 and HMBS {{could be used as}} <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> reference genes in the present study. Expression analyses of four candidate target genes with <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> and <b>the</b> two least stable genes showed that a combination of stable reference genes leads to more discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes, while the least stable genes failed to do so. Therefore, HMBS and HPRT 1 are recommended as <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>stable</b> reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data at different stages of eggshell formation in brown-egg laying hens. Available statistical programs for reference gene ranking should include more robust analysis capability to analyse the gene expression data generated from factorial design experiments...|$|R
