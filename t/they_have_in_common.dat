5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|E

According to their traditions, the god Brahma assigned to them a goats skin, the bark of trees and lac- so they could graze cattle, dye skins of goat, and deer; and tan hides with bark and lac. Another tradition, claims that the origin of the word Khatik has been derived from the Hindi word khat, which, means an immediate killing. They relate this to early days when they used to supply mutton to the kings of Rajasthan. While other sources claim that the word khatik is said to have originated from the Sanskrit word kathika, which means to butcher or hunter.|$|E
25|$|OBE can be {{compared}} across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions can compare themselves, by checking to see what outcomes <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions. The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary for the job.|$|E

Semigran and VanDerWerff also called Figgins's actions into question. The sequence after the announcement was lauded by Fallon and Canning, who were impressed by the spliced presentation of multiple aftermaths. Poniewozik said it led to the episode's [...] "theme of community—that is, that not all these characters' problems may be equal, but that they're best able to handle them when they recognize what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> Everyone ... can feel like an outsider on prom night." [...] VanDerWerff also talked about the sense of community, which [...] "has mostly been absent in season two", and noted that [...] "Glee somehow found a way to show off the best AND worst of high school and worked past its own storytelling issues to capture raw emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{convictions}} in the 1949 trial {{encouraged the}} Department of Justice {{to prepare for}} additional prosecutions of CPUSA leaders. Three months after the trial, in January1950, {{a representative of the}} Justice Department testified before Congress during appropriation hearings to justify an increase in funding to support Smith Act prosecutions. See also Fast, Howard, [...] "The Big Finger", Masses & Mainstream, March, 1950, pp 62–68. He testified that there were 21,105 potential persons that could be indicted under the Smith Act, and that 12,000 of those would be indicted if the Smith Act was upheld as constitutional. The FBI had compiled a list of 200,000 persons in its Communist Index; since the CPUSA had only around 32,000 members in 1950, the FBI explained the disparity by asserting that for every official Party member, there were ten persons who were loyal to the CPUSA and ready to carry out its orders. Navasky, p 26 (32,000 figure). Seven months after the convictions, in May1950, Hoover gave a radio address in which he declared [...] "communists have been and are today at work within the very gates of America....

The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word [...] "Linux" [...] in their name.

2500|$|Guerrero teachers, {{including}} the students from Ayotzinapa, {{are known for}} their [...] "militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks." [...] The appropriation of the vehicles was, according to the students, routine and temporary. Most of the buses are usually returned after the protests conclude. This tactic has largely been tolerated by law enforcement even though it is inconvenient for other users of public transport. Though federal agents tend not to actively confront students when they [...] "borrow" [...] buses, the practice puts students and teachers at odds with local officials. Other protest tactics used by the students include throwing rocks at police officers, blocking roads, and stealing property. Students claim those tactics are {{the only way to get}} attention and earn funds from the government. Local authorities in Guerrero tend to be suspicious of student protests because they suspect them of having ties with leftist guerrillas or rival political groups. In 1995, the Guerrero state police killed 17 farmers and injured 21 others when they were carrying out a protest. The massacre led to the creation of the Popular Revolutionary Army (Spanish: Ejército Popular Revolucionario), which is believed by some state officials to retain some political influence in Guerrero. Students claim to have no ties with such groups, and that the only thing <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with them is their socialist ideology. In addition, in places like Guerrero, where the bus companies are assumed to pay protection money, the student campaigns are seen as threatening to organized crime.|$|E
