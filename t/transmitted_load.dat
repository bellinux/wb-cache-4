Two methods, the multibody simulations (MBS) and a simplified method, are demonstrated for the gear <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> calculation. The simplified method is verified by the MBS results. The long-term extreme value of the gear <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> for wind speeds from the cut-in to the cut-out values is calculated by the simplified method from the long-term distribution of the main shaft torque. Three statistical methods for long-term extreme value analysis of the main shaft torque in the offshore wind turbines are presented. They are then used to predict the extreme value of the gear <b>transmitted</b> <b>load.</b> An alternative approach, the design state or the environmental contour method is proposed and verified by the full long-term results. The methods are exemplified by a 5 MW gearbox case study. The results of this paper are the basis for further work in Ultimate Limit State (ULS) gear design...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFastened joint {{design is}} based {{essentially}} on good prediction of fastener-load distribution. The <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> depends on geometrical specifications of coincident holes. Because {{of the low}} through-thickness compressive strength of laminated composite materials, a high clamp-up {{cannot be applied to}} composite joints. So in single or double lap shear configurations, a sliding phase occurs during loading. Thus the final <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> distribution is directly linked to bolt-hole clearance and location error.

40|$|Abstract â€” In {{order to}} {{maximize}} throughput in end-system multicast, {{it is necessary}} to have fine-grained control over the <b>transmit</b> <b>load</b> of each participating member. This both avoids bottlenecks where members are overloaded, and allows heterogeneous members to contribute as much transmit capacity as they are able or willing to. In this paper, we describe and simulate an unstructured end-system multicast protocol called Chunkyspread that provides members with fine-grained control over their <b>transmit</b> <b>load,</b> scales well, has relatively low latencies, and can tolerate high membership churn. Chunkyspread is designed as a flexible framework that easily incorporates different constraints and optimizations. For instance, it is straightforward to add titfor-tat or path disjointness as constraints to the system. This paper demonstrates the performance of Chunkyspread through extensive simulations, and provides partial validation of these simulations on Emulab. It also provides detailed comparisons with Splitstream, a structured heterogeneous end-system multicast protocol. The simulations show that Chunkyspread provides far better control over <b>transmit</b> <b>load</b> than Splitstream, while exhibiting comparable or better latency and responsiveness to churn...|$|R
40|$|WOSInternational audienceThis {{study is}} {{concerned}} with increasing the performance of adhesively bonded structures. Adhesively bonded joints offer many advantages, but stress singularities {{can contribute to the}} initiation and the propagation of crack in adhesive joints. Therefore, designing adhesively bonded joints which strongly limit the influence of edge effects can significantly increases the <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> by the assembly. Cylindrical joints are associated with high substrate strength in the radial direction, meaning that peel and cleavage forces have different effects compared to simple lap joints. But, for such assemblies, edge effects also exist. The aim of this paper is first to analyse stress concentrations in cylindrical joints in the case of axial loadings, starting from refined finite element computations under a linear elastic assumption. Thus as the stress state in the adhesive thickness can be complex associated to edge effects, simplified methods can lead to an overestimation of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> by the assembly as they generally are not able to represent effects of stress concentrations in the adhesive thickness. Secondly, geometries which strongly limit the influence of edge effects are proposed.

Due to limited technical possibilities and mathematical apparatus such analyses were carried out only {{on the basis of the}} theory of plates with constant thickness. An unquestionable advantage of such numerical modelling is a short time needed to obtain final results, which enables profound analysis of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>load.</b> The knowledge of course of pressure distribution along the contact lines of particular pairs of intermeshing teeth in worm gears already in the design phase enables taking into consideration in adequate correction or even modification of the working surface of teeth, with the aim to equalise the distribution of pressure...|$|E

40|$|WOSInternational audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{contributions of}} numerical modelling {{for the analysis}} of adhesively bonded assemblies for marine applications. Such applications are often characterised by relatively thick, 0. 5 mm or more, adhesive joints and by a possible variability of the bond line thickness associated with large-scale structures manufactured in boatyard environment. Experimental and numerical analysis in the case of shear tests are proposed to study the influence of bond line thickness on the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive. In order to accurately analyse the complete non-linear behaviour of an adhesive in an assembly, specimens with low edge effects have to be used. An increase in the thickness of the bond line leads to an increase in the influence of the edge effects, computed under elastic assumption. As those numerical results are not able to completely analyse all the experimental observations, various 2 D simulations, with refined meshes, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive are proposed to complete the analysis. Even for bonded assemblies with low edge effects, computed under elastic assumptions, the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the thickness of the joint, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive underlines that an increase in the bond line thickness leads to an increase in equivalent plastic deformation close to the free edges. This property can explain that an increase in the bond line thickness can lead to a reduction in the <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> associated to crack initiation...|$|E

A variable-variable mesh stiffness (VVMS) model was used to simulate the external and internal spur gear mesh behavior, and an equivalent conventional gear train concept was adapted for the dynamic studies. The analysis can be applied either involute or noninvolute spur gearing. By utilizing the equivalent gear train concept, the developed method may be extended for use {{for all types of}} epicyclic gearing. The method is incorporated into a computer program so that the static and dynamic behavior of individual components can be examined. Items considered in the analysis are: (1) static and dynamic load sharing among the planets; (2) floating or fixed Sun gear; (3) actual tooth geometry, including errors and modifications; (4) positioning errors of the planet gears; (5) torque variations due to noninvolute gear action. A mathematical model comprised of power source, load, and planetary transmission is used to determine the instantaneous loads to which the components are subjected. It considers fluctuating output torque, elastic behavior in the system, and loss of contact between gear teeth. The dynamic model has nine degrees of freedom resulting in a set of simultaneous second order differential equations with time varying coefficients, which are solved numerically.

This paper deals with stress analysis in coaxial bonded joints. The objective was to analyze the effect of various geometries of the different parts of the assembly in order to optimize the maximal <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> of such joints. In the case of tensile loads, the stress distributions were analyzed using axisymmetric theory of elasticity. A pressure-dependent elastic limit of the adhesive was used, in order to accurately represent the difference between tensile-shear and compression-shear loads in the mechanical response of the adhesive. In adhesively bonded joints, stress concentrations can contribute to the initiation and propagation of cracks in the adhesive. Therefore, designing adhesively bonded assemblies which strongly limit stress concentrations can significantly increase the load transmitted by the assembly. Moreover, cylindrical joints are associated with high substrate strength in the radial direction, meaning that peel and cleavage forces have different effects compared to single lap joints. A comparison between the mechanical behavior of these two joints is proposed, starting from 2 D simulations in the case of tensile and compressive loads. Furthermore, the influence of the angle of conical geometries of the bonded area, which can easily be used for such assemblies, is analyzed with respect to the stress distributions. It is shown that several geometries allow a large reduction of stress concentrations and thus lead to stronger assemblies.

Muscles contracted isometrically at firing rates of 10, 20, 30 and 100 Hz. EDL and TA + EHL were distally lengthened. Peroneal and triceps surae muscles attained a constant muscle-tendon complex length. Peroneal and triceps surae distal active force decreased significantly {{as a function}} of anterior crural muscle length, also at submaximal activation. The absolute decrease was highest for 100 Hz (peroneal muscles - 0. 87 N; triceps surae muscles - 0. 92 N), but the highest normalized decrease occurred at 10 Hz stimulation (peroneal muscles - 34 %; triceps surae muscles - 18 %). At all muscle lengths, a negative proximo-distal difference in EDL active force was present which decreased with lower firing frequencies (from - 0. 4 N at 100 Hz to - 0. 03 N at 10 Hz). The passive proximo-distal force difference attained positive values. EDL and TA + EHL length-force characteristics agree with effects of firing frequency, except for 10 Hz stimulation, where active force was higher than expected and optimum length shifted to lower muscle lengths. It is concluded that also at submaximal stimulation frequencies, extramuscular myofascial force transmission between peroneal and triceps surae muscles and antagonistic anterior crural muscles is substantial. Although lengthening of submaximally active anterior crural muscles decreases the net myofascially <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> on EDL, myofascial force transmission significantly alters effects of firing frequency on length-force characteristics.

The less mobile and more robust tarsal bones are shaped and aligned to accept and <b>transmit</b> large <b>loads</b> during the early phases of stance (initial contact and loading response phases of walking, and inadvertent heel strikes during running). The tarsals of the midfoot, which are smaller and shorter than the hindfoot tarsals, appear well oriented to <b>transmit</b> <b>loads</b> between the hindfoot and forefoot; this is necessary for load transfer and locking of the foot complex into a rigid lever for late stance phase.

40|$|Gas {{bearings}} enable successful {{applications in}} high speed oil-free microturbomachinery. This thesis presents analysis and experiments {{of the dynamic}} performance of a rotor supported on Rayleigh step gas bearings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Rayleigh step hybrid gas bearings exhibit adequate stiffness and damping capability in a narrow range of shaft speeds, up to ~ 20 krpm. Rotor coastdown responses were performed for two test bearing sets with nominal radial clearance of 25. 4 ?m and 38. 1 ?m, respectively. A near-frictionless carbon (NFC) coating was applied on the rotor to reduce friction against its bearings at liftoff and touchdown. However, the rotor still experienced dry friction at low shaft speeds (below ~ 4, 000 rpm). Experiments show that the supply pressure raises the rotor critical speed and decreases the system damping ratio. The geometry of the Rayleigh steps distributed on the rotor surface generates a time varying pressure field and results in a sizable 4 X super synchronous component of bearing <b>transmitted</b> <b>load.</b> The external supply gas pressure affects slightly the onset speed of instability of the rotor-bearing system. The unstable whirl frequencies are nearly fixed at the system natural frequency (~ 120 Hz). Analysis with a finite element model predicts the stiffness and damping force coefficients for the bearing accounting for a purely hydrodynamic operation condition. Predictions show the synchronous stiffness and damping coefficients decrease with shaft speed. Predicted threshold speeds of instability are lower, ~ 50 % or less than the measurement due to the analytical model limitations assuming a grooved stator. The predicted synchronous responses to imbalance correlate well with the measurements, however. The Rayleigh step gas bearing shows similar characteristics to the flexure pivot tilting pad bearing (FPTPB) tested in 2003. However, the test Rayleigh step gas bearings exhibit a much reduced stable operating speed range, below 20 krpm. The maximum speed achieved is much lower to that determined with an identical rotor supported on FPTPBs, i. e. rotor dynamically stable up to 100 krpm. The FPTPB is more reliable in high speed oil-free applications due to its excellent stability characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of static torsional mesh stiffness, load sharing ratio, and transmission errors of gears in mesh with and without a localised tooth crack. Gearing is {{perhaps one of the}} most critical components in power transmission systems. The transmission error of gears in mesh is considered to be one of the main causes of gear noise and vibration. Numerous papers have been published on gear transmission error measurement and many investigations have been devoted to gear vibration analysis. There still, however, remains to be developed a general non-linear Finite Element Model capable of predicting the effect of variations of gear torsional mesh stiffness, transmission error, <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> and load sharing ratio. The primary purpose of this study was to develop such a model and to study the behaviour of the static torsional mesh stiffness, load sharing ratio, and transmission error over one completed cycle of the tooth mesh. The research outlined in this thesis considers the variations of the whole gear body stiffness arising from the gear body rotation due to tooth bending deflection, shearing displacement, and contact deformation. Many different positions within the meshing cycle were investigated and then compared with the results of a gear mesh having a single cracked tooth. In order to handle contact problems with the finite element method, the stiffness relationship between the two contact areas must be established. Existing Finite Element codes rely on the use of the variational approach to formulate contact problems. This can be achieved by insertion of a contact element placed in between the two contacting areas where contact occurs. For modelling of gear teeth in mesh, the penalty parameter of the contact element is user-defined and it varies through the cyclic mesh. A simple strategy of how to overcome these difficulties is ++also presented. Most of the previously published finite element analysis with gears has involved only partial teeth models. In an investigation of gear transmission errors using contact elements, the whole body of the gears in mesh must be modelled, because the penalty parameter of the contact elements must account for the flexibility of the entire body of the gear not just the local stiffness at the contact point...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of transient elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) analyses of the meshing cycle of helical gears. Previous workers have analysed helical gears using a range of techniques, including thin slice models and models which take into account the effects of three-dimensional surface roughness. Previous work by the Cardiff group has investigated the effects of tooth micro-geometry (tip relief) on contact pressures and lubrication performance. The current work investigates the effect of tooth profile errors (deviations from the involute form) on elastohydrodynamic performance. The profile errors were measured on helical test gears using a Klingelnberg P 65 gear measuring machine. The gears are of 6 mm normal module, 20 Âº reference pressure angle, 26. 3 Âº base helix angle, and 44 mm face width, with the wheel having 24 teeth and the pinion 23 teeth. The gears were analysed over the meshing cycle, and the <b>transmitted</b> <b>load</b> was chosen such that the maximum Hertzian contact pressure would be 1. 6 GPa in the example shown here. The tooth load corresponding to the contact pressure of 1. 6 GPa is 60 kN with Hertzian semi dimensions a = 0. 5 mm and b = 36 mm. Profile error and tip relief geometry was included in the surface geometry based on the digital profile information obtained from the Klingelnberg measurements. It should be emphasised that the profile deviations are at much lower spatial frequencies than surface roughness effects â€“ indeed profile errors would usually be removed by the standard filtering process applied to measurements of gear surface finish. Figure 1 shows a comparison of film thickness contours for the smooth (upper) case (with tip relief) and the case including profile errors in addition to tip relief (lower). The presence of the profile error features can be seen to {{have a significant effect on}} the lubricant film thickness, with the loadbearing area developing a series of grooves. Between the grooves, the loadbearing surface develops ridges which give rise to elevated contact pressures significantly above those found in the smooth result. These are plotted in Figure 2 which is a section. through the contact at x = 0, which is the meshing contact line. The effects of profile errors on lubrication performance of helical gears can be clearly seen in these results, and the paper goes on to discuss the implications of these rarely considered effects for surface longevity...|$|E
