When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, <b>telephone</b> <b>costs,</b> and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E

50|$|Stipend has a specific, different, {{use in the}} Church of England, {{meaning the}} salary of a stipendiary minister, one who {{receives}} payment directly from the diocese (as opposed {{to other forms of}} disbursement such as free use of a house in return for clerical duties, known as house-for-duty). A non-stipendiary minister (increasingly being termed a self-supporting minister or an ordained local minister) is therefore one who is licensed to perform clerical duties but without receiving any kind of payment from the diocese — although non-stipendiary ministers often receive reimbursement of expenses incurred in pursuit of their duties, e.g. travel, postage, and <b>telephone</b> <b>costs.</b> Non-stipendiary ministers normally depend on secular employment or pensions for their income and are often unavailable for pastoral duties when they are fulfilling their obligations to their employer. A minister in secular employment, on the other hand, is a minister who exercises a significant ministry in and through their work. This is distinct from chaplaincy.|$|E

Six incentives are examined: the Internet as an outstanding pre-selection tool, as a means for finding the best prices worldwide, the possibility of browsing without being pressurized into buying, a way to find new, fashionable or rare products, a time-effective tool and access to a constantly up-dated offer. Nine contrasting disincentives are also studied: payment security problems, the lack of interactivity, <b>telephone</b> <b>costs,</b> the loneliness of Internet users, the poverty of sense stimuli, delivery prices and delay, foreign exchange risks, legal guarantees and fiscal misunderstandings. In each case, recommendations and/or suggestions are made for taking advantage of perceived incentives or for dealing with perceived disincentives...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a cost {{effective}} voice network using the VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology is described. The connections of Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs) to a VoIP network, to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) {{and to the}} ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Networks) are considered from the technological point of view; the VoIP protocol architecture, the VoIP standards, quality of service (QoS) issues in the VoIP networks are discussed, traffic load and channel capacity calculations of a sample application are presented. It is emphasized that government organizations, universities, big companies, banks and other establishments, having units or campuses situated in different sites {{in the same city}} or in different cites can make use of the VoIP technology to reduce their <b>telephone</b> <b>costs.</b> Although the VoIP technology is ready for such applications, there is an argument in Turkey whether or not VoIP is legal even for intranet applications.

40|$|During the mid 90 s, {{data and}} voice began to merge, {{propelled}} by advances in compression technology. The ubiquity of routed Internet Protocol (IP) networks, {{and the desire to}} trim telephony costs are the major driving forces of the deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP). One advantage of VoIP technologies is that they leverage existing network resources and dramatically reduce, or major eliminate <b>telephone</b> <b>costs.</b> If there is an existing Wide Area Network (WAN) then VoIP could be employed over the WAN. However, a WAN link may not be available at each node location. Then only local point of presence (POP) for router based Internet connectivity would be required for VoIP over the Internet. The Internet could be the part of the backbone for the routing of the voice packets. The advantages of deployment of VoIP are evident. The {{issue of whether or not}} to deploy VoIP is more concerned with technical implementation and Quality of Service (QoS) that with a cost benefit analysis. This thesis analysis some of the technical issues surrounding the use of Internet Telephony. Specifically, the Internet Architecture and required QoS for reliable voice, and issues that arise from a dynamic network such as the Internet, and both software and hardware approaches to workstation solution to Internet Telephony.

40|$|This {{newsletter}} {{consists of}} the following: (1) ARM Science Team Meeting Scheduled [...] The 11 th Annual ARM Science Team meeting is scheduled for March 19 - 23, 2001, in Atlanta, Georgia. Members of the science team will exchange research results achieved by using ARM data. The science team is composed of working groups that investigate four topics: instantaneous radiative flux, cloud parameterizations and modeling, cloud properties, and aerosols. The annual meeting brings together the science team's 150 members to discuss issues related to ARM and its research. The members represent universities, government laboratories and research facilities, and independent research companies. (2) Communications to Extended Facilities Upgraded [...] New communications equipment has been installed {{at all of the}} SGP extended facilities. Shelters were installed to house the new equipment used to transfer data from instruments via the Internet to the site data system at the central facility. This upgrade has improved data availability from the extended facilities to 100 % and reduced <b>telephone</b> <b>costs</b> greatly. (3) SGP Goes ''Buggy'' [...] Steve Sekelsky, a researcher from the University of Massachusetts, is planning to bring a 95 -GHz radar to the SGP central facility for deployment in March-October 2001. The radar will help to identify signals due to insects flying in the air. The ARM millimeter cloud radar, which operates at 35 GHz, is sensitive to such insect interference. Testing will also be performed by using a second 35 -GHz radar with a polarized radar beam, which can differentiate signals from insects versus cloud droplets. (4) Winter Fog [...] Fog can add to hazards already associated with winter weather. Common types of fog formation include advection, radiation, and steam. Advection fog: An advection fog is a dense fog that forms when a warm, moist air mass moves into an area with cooler ground below. For example, fog can form in winter when warmer, water-saturated air from the south (associated with a warm front) moves over the cold, snow-covered ground. The cold ground cools the warmer air, and the water vapor condenses into small water droplets, producing a thick fog. Radiation fog: Sometimes referred to as ground fog, a radiation fog typically forms at night when skies are clear and winds are calm. At night, the ground radiates heat away from the surface, cooling the ground and the layer of air directly above it. If this lower layer of air is moist, the cooling will condense the water vapor in it, and fog will form. Radiation fog can be very patchy. Steam fog: Steam fog forms over water when cooler air blows in over a warmer water surface. The warmer water evaporates from the water surface and rises into the cooler air. The cooler air then condenses water vapor into fog. Fog can usually be prevented if a wind is present. The wind mixes the air, bringing warmer air from aloft to the ground and reducing the condensing ability of the cold air near the ground. Fog ''burns off'' in the daytime as the morning sun warms the air and evaporates the fog droplets back into the vapor form...|$|E

50|$|Airfone was an air-ground {{radiotelephone}} service developed by MCI founder John D. Goeken, and operated under the names Airfone, GTE Airfone and Verizon. Airfone allowed passengers to make telephone calls (later including data modem service) in-flight. Airfone handsets were often {{located in the}} middle airliner seatbacks, with two handsets per row for 6-wide coach seating configurations, and more or less depending on the aircraft layout and fare class. First class cabins typically had one handset per seat. Some planes had one or more bulkhead mounted phone stations with cordless handsets that the passengers could use, instead of the multiple wired handsets.

On September 4, 1914, President Wilson called upon Congress to raise an {{additional}} $100 million through “internal” taxes (in contrast to customs duties). These revenues were needed {{not only because}} of the loss of revenues but also because of added federal spending related to the war being fought in Europe. In response, Congress passed the Emergency Internal Revenue Tax Act of 1914. The Act was mostly a renewal of the excises contained in the Spanish-American War Revenue Act. It included a tax of 1 cent for <b>telephone</b> calls <b>costing</b> more than 15 cents. The taxes instituted under this Act were initially set to expire on December 31, 1915. However, on December 17, 1915, Congress passed a joint resolution that continued the taxes instituted in 1914 through December 31, 1916.
