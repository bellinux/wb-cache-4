5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E

40|$|Fragility, {{quantifying}} the rapidity {{of variation}} of relaxation times, is analysed {{for a series}} of model glass formers, which differ in the softness of their interparticle interactions. In an attempt to rationalize experimental observations in colloidal suspensions <b>that</b> <b>softer</b> interactions lead to stronger (less fragile) glass formers, we study the variation of relaxation dynamics with density, rather than temperature, as a control parameter. We employ density temperature scaling, analyzed in recent studies, to address the question. We find that while employing inverse density in place of temperature leads to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>softer</b> interactions lead to stronger behaviour, the use of scaled variables involving temperature and density lead to the opposite conclusion, similarly to earlier investigations where temperature variation of relaxation dynamics was analysed for the same systems. We rationalize our results by considering the Adam-Gibbs (AG) fragility, which incorporates the density dependence of the configurational entropy and an activation energy that may arise from other properties of a glass former. Within the framework of the Adam-Gibbs relation, by employing density temperature scaling for the analysis, we find <b>that</b> <b>softer</b> particles make more fragile glasses, as deduced from dynamical quantities, which is found to be consistent with the Adam-Gibbs fragility...|$|R

5|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} the exceptional preservational quality of the Burgess Shale fossils are far from clear. The interpretation of what is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked: whether the animals were buried where they lived, or washed long distances by sediment flows; and whether the water at the burial sites was anoxic or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals. The traditional view is <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> bodies and organs could only be preserved in anoxic conditions, otherwise oxygen-breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization. This would imply that the sea-floor organisms could not have lived there. However, in 2006 Caron and Jackson concluded that the sea-floor animals were buried where they lived. One of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft-bodied animals such as polychaetes, which had already died shortly before the burial event, {{and would have been}} fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment. Other evidence for burial where the animals had lived includes the presence of tubes and burrows, and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed – such as a group of carnivorous priapulids clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened. Fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} {{should be allowed}} in schools {{has been on the}} rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools should be required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E

25|$|It remains {{possible}} that the correlation {{is due to a}} third factor: people who lead unhealthy lifestyles might consume more soft drinks.

25|$|The depositional {{environment}} {{of the majority of}} Burgess-Shale-type assemblages is outer shelf, deeper water. The Emu Bay Shale in contrast, appears to represent deposition in restricted basins on the inner shelf, indicating <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> tissue preservation occurred in a range of environmental settings during the Cambrian. Some Emu Bay fossils display extensive mineralization of soft tissues, most often of blocky apatite or fibrous calcium carbonate, including the oldest phosphatized muscle tissue – along with records from Sirius Passet in Greenland, the first thus far reported from the Cambrian. Mid-gut glands are preserved three-dimensionally in calcium phosphate in the arthropods Isoxys and Oestokerkus, as in related species from the Burgess Shale.|$|E

500|$|PepsiCo's {{acquisition}} {{was seen}} by some analysts {{as a means for}} the company to increase its soft drinks sales. PepsiCo chairman D.

Before the takeover, only 1,000 of the 6,500 KFC outlets sold Pepsi Cola, and PepsiCo switched 1,800 company-owned stores to their own soft drinks with immediate effect. The purchase of KFC by PepsiCo led to some fast food competitors switching from Pepsi to Coca-Cola.

[...] "The second law was widely accepted at the time.. has been decisively rejected by modern genetics." [...] However, in the field of epigenetics, there is growing evidence <b>that</b> <b>soft</b> inheritance plays a part in the changing of some organisms' phenotypes: it leaves the genetic material (DNA) unaltered (thus not violating the central dogma of biology) but prevents the expression of genes, such as by methylation to modify DNA transcription; this can be produced by changes in behaviour and environment. Many epigenetic changes are heritable to a degree. Thus, while DNA itself is not directly altered by the environment and behavior except through selection, the relationship of the genotype to the phenotype can be altered, even across generations, by experience within the lifetime of an individual. This has led to calls for biology to reconsider Lamarckian processes in evolution in light of modern advances in molecular biology.|$|E
