5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though starvation had been avoided in southern Finland. According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War would solve all past problems, but instead the power struggle led to starvation in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} {{a majority of}} the houses on Wisteria Lane, Paul announces that he plans to open a halfway house for ex-convicts on the street. A protest against his plan escalates into a violent riot and Susan is trampled by the unruly crowd. As a result, Susan loses a kidney and learns that her second kidney is deformed and she is at severe risk of renal failure. Susan reluctantly agrees to undergo dialysis while waiting for a transplant. After Paul throws her out, Beth submits paperwork indicating that in the event of her death, her kidney would be given to Susan, and then commits suicide. Despite initial refusal, Paul allows the operation to move forward and he and Susan reconcile. After discovering that Paul has been depressed following Beth's suicide, Susan begins cooking meals for him with the assistance of Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Beth's mother and Martha Huber's sister, who secretly adds antifreeze to <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> an effort to kill him. Paul nearly dies {{as a result of the}} poisoned food. Unaware that Felicia is helping prepare his meals, Paul has Susan arrested for attempting to kill him. Eventually, Susan is released, Paul confesses to the murder of Martha Huber, and Felicia presumably dies in a car crash while fleeing town. Susan and her family move back onto Wisteria Lane. During a dinner party, Gabrielle's former stepfather, Alejandro (Tony Plana), who raped her during her childhood, attempts to harm Gabrielle until her husband, Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) kills him. Susan, Lynette, and Bree agree to help cover up the crime.|$|E

25|$|Loons nest {{during the}} summer on {{freshwater}} lakes and/or large ponds. Smaller bodies of water (up to 0.5km2) will usually only have one pair.

25|$|Sometimes food {{not found}} in its {{original}} culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malaysian dishes. Food from one culture is sometimes cooked using styles taken from another. This means that although many Malaysian dishes originate from another culture, {{they have their own}} identities. Often <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia is different from the original dishes; for example, Chinese food is often sweeter in Malaysian versions than the original.

40|$|In {{the course}} of investigations, the {{structural}} changes in proteins were established, which {{were associated with the}} preliminary treatment of meat ingredients, a pH level of the system and parameters of thermal treatment. The pasteurization regimes allowed retaining a protein nitrogen proportion up to 94 % by the end of canned food storage duration. Upon sterilization, the losses in protein nitrogen were two times higher. A negative eﬀect of more acidic sauce on preservation of the protein nitrogen fraction <b>in</b> canned <b>foods</b> was established. An accumulation of the peptide nitrogen fraction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canned <b>foods</b> <b>in</b> tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization was two times more intensive. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> sterilized canned <b>foods,</b> <b>the</b> processes of accumulation of the low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds were more intensive, which suggests a depth of destruction of the protein and peptide nitrogen fraction. It was shown that an accumulation of amino-ammonia nitrogen during canned food storage was on average 12. 4 % irrespective of the pH value in the used sauces and the type of thermal treatment. A shiﬅ in the pH value of <b>the</b> canned <b>foods</b> toward <b>the</b> acid side upon pasteurization was noticed. With that, a degree of the shiﬅ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canned <b>foods</b> <b>in</b> tomato sauce was 2. 5 times higher than the pH value of <b>the</b> canned <b>foods</b> <b>in</b> sour cream sauce. When sterilizing canned foods, another dynamics of the pH values was observed: a pH value declined by 0. 39 units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canned <b>foods</b> <b>in</b> tomato sauce and grew by 0. 22 units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canned <b>foods</b> <b>in</b> sour cream sauce.

25|$|Symptoms of food {{intolerance}} vary greatly, {{and can be}} mistaken for the symptoms of a food allergy. While true allergies are associated with fast-acting immunoglobulin IgE responses, {{it can be difficult}} to determine the offending food causing a {{food intolerance}} because the response generally takes place over a prolonged period of time. Thus, the causative agent and the response are separated in time, and may not be obviously related. Food intolerance symptoms usually begin about half an hour after eating or drinking <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> question, but sometimes symptoms may be delayed by up to 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|Sharks {{are known}} to be {{opportunistic}} feeders, and the bull shark is no exception to this, as {{it is part of the}} Carcharhinus family of sharks. Normally, sharks eat in short bursts, and when food is scarce, sharks digest for a much longer period of time in order to avoid starvation. As part of their survival mechanism, bull sharks will regurgitate <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> their stomachs in order to escape from a predator. This is a distraction tactic; if the predator moves to eat the regurgitated food the bull shark can use the opportunity to escape.|$|E

25|$|The lower {{temperature}} of cooking (the boiling point of water) {{is a significant}} safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>in</b> a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces {{the time needed to}} heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels. Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.|$|E
