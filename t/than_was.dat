5|$|Although {{the rink}} was budgeted for $5 million, it was {{constructed}} for only $3.2 million ($ million today), {{making it one}} of the few Millennium Park attractions to cost less <b>than</b> <b>was</b> initially budgeted. The rink was funded by and named for the McCormick Tribune Foundation, which was established by former Chicago Tribune owner and publisher Robert R. McCormick. The McCormick Tribune Foundation is a supporter of the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum and the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, both of which are also located in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{improvements}} Galileo Galilei made to the telescope, with a magnifying capability of 20×, {{he was able to}} see celestial bodies more distinctly <b>than</b> <b>was</b> ever possible before. This allowed Galilei to discover in either December 1609 or January 1610 what {{came to be known as}} the Galilean moons.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more damage <b>than</b> <b>was</b> the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, {{even though there were}} only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E

40|$|Rabbit skin {{treated for}} a few minutes with ultra-violet light and then inoculated at once with vaccine virus is less {{susceptible}} to the action of the virus <b>than</b> <b>is</b> untreated skin. If 24, 48, or 72 hours elapse between the time of irradiation and inoculation, the treated skin appears to <b>be</b> more susceptible <b>than</b> <b>is</b> untreated skin. Skin repeatedly exposed to ultra-violet light is less susceptible to the action of vaccine virus <b>than</b> <b>is</b> non-irradiated skin...|$|R
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{case of this}} type occurs when a pronoun stands alone following the word than. Here the objective form is again predominant in informal usage (they <b>are</b> older <b>than</b> us), as would <b>be</b> expected if <b>than</b> <b>were</b> analyzed as a preposition. However traditionally <b>than</b> <b>is</b> considered a conjunction, and so in formal and grammatically careful English the pronoun often takes the form that would appear if <b>than</b> <b>were</b> followed by a clause: they <b>are</b> older <b>than</b> we (by analogy with ...<b>than</b> we <b>are),</b> but she likes him better than me (if the intended meaning is [...] "...than she likes me").|$|R
5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together {{with the presence of}} the E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period <b>than</b> <b>was</b> immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland won the AAFC {{championship}} {{again in}} 1947 behind an offensive attack that employed the forward pass more frequently and effectively <b>than</b> <b>was</b> typical at the time. The Browns' offensive success {{was driven by}} Brown's version of the T formation, which was gradually replacing the single-wing formation as football's most popular and effective scheme.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role <b>than</b> <b>was</b> previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less <b>than</b> <b>was</b> once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is {{only a small part of}} the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
50|$|Product {{churning}} is {{the business}} practice whereby more of the product <b>is</b> sold <b>than</b> <b>is</b> beneficial to the consumer.

5|$|DragonFly {{originally}} {{used the}} FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but {{starting with the}} 1.4 release switched to NetBSD's pkgsrc system, which was perceived {{as a way of}} lessening the amount of work needed for third-party software availability. Eventually, maintaining compatibility with pkgsrc proved to require more effort <b>than</b> <b>was</b> initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{was fitted}} {{experimentally}} {{with a larger}} bridge <b>than</b> <b>was</b> then standard, to house both ship and fire control personnel under armor, while Utah received a heavily armored fire-control tower atop a standard-sized bridge. The former proved especially successful, {{to the point that}} when a larger armored fire-control tower and standard bridge was proposed for the Nevada class, it was rejected in favor of a roomier bridge like that of Florida.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008 {{a company}} from the 1st Commando Regiment {{became the first}} formed Army Reserve unit to see combat since World War II when it was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of the}} Australian Special Operations Task Group. The initial deployment proved problematic however, with a subsequent inquiry finding that the company had received less support for its pre-deployment preparations <b>than</b> <b>was</b> typical for regular units and that its training was inadequate. The 1st Commando Regiment contributed forces to several other Special Operations Task Group rotations.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} supply U.S. allies, much more {{production}} was required <b>than</b> <b>was</b> possible through the firms producing the M2 (and the larger M3 Half-track). International Harvester (IH) could produce half-tracks, but some differences {{had to be}} accepted due to different manufacturing methods and components. This led to IH producing for lend-lease the M5 Half-track and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was made}} a fellow of Trinity on 10 October 1855, sooner <b>than</b> <b>was</b> the norm, and was asked to prepare lectures on hydrostatics and optics and to set {{examination}} papers. The following February he was urged by Forbes {{to apply for the}} newly vacant Chair of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen. His father assisted him in the task of preparing the necessary references, but died on 2 April at Glenlair before either knew the result of Maxwell's candidacy. Maxwell accepted the professorship at Aberdeen, leaving Cambridge in November 1856.|$|E
5|$|Monterverdi's recitative {{style was}} {{influenced}} by Peri's, in Euridice, although in L'Orfeo recitative is less preponderant <b>than</b> <b>was</b> usual in dramatic music at this time. It accounts {{for less than a}} quarter of the first act's music, around a third of the second and third acts, and a little under half in the final two acts.|$|E

For it is passively instead of actively impersonal.|$|R
50|$|The tiny {{auditory}} ossicles of {{the middle}} ear and associated areas were also well preserved in this Castorocauda fossil. Features of these bones confirms the evolutionary position of docodonts as more closely related to crown-group mammals <b>than</b> <b>is</b> Morganucodon.

50|$|Some {{teachers}} {{were more concerned}} about some problems than others.

Inexperienced teachers were more worried about fixed class schedules and the lack of supporting materials <b>than</b> <b>were</b> experienced teachers.|$|R
5|$|No Admiralty {{camouflage}} {{section was}} established until October 1940. Admiralty camouflage schemes promulgated in 1941 were not universally adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments. Nearly all destroyers and larger ships wore an Admiralty disruptive camouflage scheme by late 1942; but Commonwealth captains executed official camouflage schemes with greater variation <b>than</b> <b>was</b> customary with American measures.|$|E

5|$|Organ {{builders}} {{began to}} lean towards specifications with fewer mixtures and high-pitched stops. They preferred {{to use more}} 8 and 16 stops in their specifications and wider pipe scales. These practices created a warmer, richer sound <b>than</b> <b>was</b> common in the 18th century. Organs began {{to be built in}} concert halls (such as the organ at the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris), and composers such as Camille Saint-Saëns and Gustav Mahler used the organ in their orchestral works.|$|E

5|$|Overclaiming in {{aerial warfare}} is not uncommon. During the Second World War, pilots often claimed more {{aircraft}} shot down <b>than</b> <b>was</b> actually the case. The Air Ministry released a press statement on 15 September that 175–185 German aircraft {{had been shot}} down. The actual number of aircraft destroyed was ⅔ lower and significantly less {{than the number of}} German losses on 15 and 18 August (The Hardest Day), in which the Luftwaffe lost 75 and 69 respectively.|$|E

Since his introduction in Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas has received positive critical response from video game publications with most of them focusing on his development in 358/2 Days.

5|$|The RAF sought more thrust <b>than</b> <b>was</b> {{available}} from the Avon 100 series; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine.

The resulting Avon 203 produced 10,000lbf (44.48kN) of thrust, and was the engine for the Hunter F.6.|$|E
