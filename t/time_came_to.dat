5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst, Gelderland, growing up on a family farm with his parents and {{assisting}} his grandfather with the potato harvest each year. There were no machines or tractors, so when the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> extract the potatoes, his family tied a rope around Overmars' waist, connected it to a cart and made him run while they pulled the crop out.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA {{took action}} against Pittston's new plan of {{operation}} {{and offered to}} reach a settlement. The coal company stayed quiet, and when the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> renew the health care and retirement benefit plans for its workers, Pittston refused. The refusal to renew the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. These people were not just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|E

5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Achebe {{moved away}} from his family {{to the village of}} Nekede, four {{kilometres}} from Owerri. He enrolled as a student at the Central School, where his older brother John taught. In Nekede, Achebe gained an appreciation for Mbari, a traditional art form that seeks to invoke the gods' protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form of sculpture and collage. (He would later suggest the name for the Mbari Writers and Artists Club that was founded in Ibadan by Ulli Beier and others in 1961.) When the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> change to secondary school, in 1944, Achebe sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha and the even more prestigious Government College in Umuahia.|$|E
5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> move Missouri.|$|E

5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage {{that preceded the}} infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over an assault {{that was going to}} cost dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E
5|$|Józef Młynarczyk, the team's goalkeeper, was hungover {{when the}} <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> leave the hotel for the airport, having {{not been to}} sleep {{following}} {{a night on the}} town with a friend. Kulesza and one of his assistants, Bernard Blaut, decided to leave Młynarczyk behind, much to the indignation of some players, including Stanisław Terlecki, Zbigniew Boniek, Włodzimierz Smolarek and Władysław Żmuda. Terlecki, a stridently pro-Western intellectual with a reputation for mocking the communist establishment, was particularly angered, and himself drove Młynarczyk to the airport, where the players continued their protests. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed Młynarczyk to travel with the team.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth {{and final}} {{season of the}} Australian police drama Blue Heelers premiered on the Seven Network on 1 April 2006 and aired on Saturday nights at 8:30 pm.

When, in late 2005, the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> renew Blue Heelers, Seven commissioned eleven further episodes to be produced, but its future after this was still undecided.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe's {{homosexual}} {{activities from}} time to <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{the attention of the}} authorities, and were investigated by the police; information was added to his MI5 file, but in no case was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E
5|$|Under the Mongols new {{technologies}} and commodities were exchanged across the Old World, particularly Eurasia. Professor Thomas T.Allsen noted many personnel exchanges occurred during the Mongol period. There were many significant developments in economy (especially trade and public finance), military, medicine, agriculture, cuisine, astronomy, printing, geography, and historiography, which were not limited to Eurasia but also included North Africa. The Mongolian Empire functioned as the principal cultural clearing house for the Old World until its downturn when it was gradually replaced by maritime Europe which in <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> perform similar offices for the Old World and the New.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{assemble}} {{and publish}} {{the story in}} book form, Hergé decided to divide it into two volumes and to give them each a new title; the first half, which is set in Egypt, Arabia, and India, he titled Cigars of the Pharaoh, while the second half, set in China, became The Blue Lotus. Cigars {{was the first of}} the Adventures published by Casterman, with whom Hergé had signed a contract in late 1933, although much to his annoyance, they delayed publication until the autumn of 1934, after the culmination of the summer holidays. In 1936, they successfully requested that he produce several colour plates to be inserted into the reprint of the book.|$|E

5|$|When the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} {{were faced with}} the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment (time spent filming and publicising each movie), together with finding it difficult to do other work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and when the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> move on, {{those who had not}} finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|At the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of {{the delegates}} were {{selected}} by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on {{the rank and file}} to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of}} his life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the game, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech would run away with an overwhelming victory. Tech received the ball to begin the game, and on the game's second play, Virginia Tech's Ken Edwards ran 58 yards on a trick play for the game's first touchdown. Mississippi fumbled the ball on its first offensive play and Virginia Tech recovered the turnover. Three plays later, Tech scored another touchdown on a seven-yard run by Terry Smoot. After stopping the Rebels with their defense, Tech appeared to have another chance to score when the Hokies' Ron Davidson returned an Ole Miss punt to the Rebels' 42-yard line. Despite the excellent field position, Tech was unable to score after Hokie quarterback Al Kinkaid was sacked for a 19-yard loss. Despite the setback, Tech was able to keep Ole Miss from scoring in {{the first quarter}} and tacked on a 29-yard field goal by kicker Jack Simcsak before <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> an end in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, Tech led 170.|$|E
5|$|Initially Los Alamos was to {{have been}} a {{military}} laboratory with Oppenheimer and other researchers commissioned into the Army. Oppenheimer {{went so far as to}} order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform, but two key physicists, Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California. Financial and procurement activities were the responsibility of the University of California under a 1 January 1943 letter of intent from the OSRD. This was superseded by a formal contract with the Manhattan District on 20 April 1943, which was backdated to 1 January. Financial operations were directed by the resident business officer, J. A. D. Muncy. The intent was that it would be militarized when the <b>time</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> finally assemble the bomb, but by this time the Los Alamos Laboratory had grown so large that this was considered both impractical and unnecessary, as the anticipated difficulties regarding civilians working on dangerous tasks had not occurred.|$|E
