By 1930, the population had grown to 59,091, although <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>was</b> boosted by the merging of Nørre Tranders, Rørdal Fabriksby, Øster Sundby and Øster Uttrup into Aalborg.

The rescue allowed the vast majority of Denmark's Jewish population to avoid capture by the Nazis.

5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>was</b> $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E
5|$|Other basic {{defensive}} measures {{included the}} removal of signposts, milestones (some had the carved details obscured with cement) and railway station signs making {{it more likely that}} an enemy would become confused. Petrol pumps were removed from service stations near the coast and there were careful preparations for the destruction of those that were left. Detailed plans were made for destroying anything that might prove useful to the invader such as port facilities, key roads and rolling stock. In certain areas non-essential citizens were evacuated.

5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain who the {{causeway}} is named after, but <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>was</b> at the latest pre-Renaissance, {{and the majority of}} sources agree that it has its origins in the medieval period or earlier. The name Wade appears {{as one of the most}} common surnames in a 1381 poll tax register from Suffolk, and philologist P H Reaney reports multiple instances of it from the 11th and 12th centuries. The names Wade or Wada were common in pre-medieval English history and historian William Searle records around a dozen historic Wades in his Onomasticon of early Anglo-Saxon names. The earliest figure from the region identified as Wade in extant writings is Duke Wada, a historical personage of Saxon descent who is recorded in 1083 as having been a prominent figure living in the Yorkshire area around 798. It is possible that this person was either named after—or has been conflated over time with—one of several earlier, mythological figures known as Wade. Chadwick states that it is most probable that the causeway is named directly after a well-known mythological, rather than historical, Wada.|$|E
5|$|Looking 4 Myself was {{predicted}} to sell 120,000 – 130,000 units during its first-week in the United States, based upon first day sales. <b>The</b> <b>figure</b> <b>was</b> under-weight compared to his previous effort Raymond vs. Raymond (2010), which sold 329,000 units {{during the same}} period and to date has sold over two million copies worldwide. Despite the low figure estimation, Looking 4 Myself was still expected to top the Billboard 200 chart on the week ending June 17, 2012, and did so with 128,000 first-week copies sold domestically. The album marks Usher's fourth consecutive number one studio album in the United States. The following week of the album's release, Looking 4 Myself dropped to number six on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 48,000 copies. In its third week, the album again dropped positions, falling three spots to number nine, selling 36,000 units. In its fourth week, Looking 4 Myself fell to number fifteen, and in its fifth week rose to number fourteen, selling 20,178 copies.

5|$|The Burnside Fountain is a non-functioning {{drinking}} fountain at {{the southeast corner}} of Worcester Common in Worcester, Massachusetts. It consists of two parts, a pink granite basin, and a bronze statue of a young boy riding a sea turtle. The basin was designed by architect Henry Bacon, who later designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., and <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>was</b> created by sculptor Charles Y. Harvey. Harvey committed suicide before finishing the sculpture, and Sherry Fry completed the bronze. The Burnside Fountain was commissioned in 1905 by the city of Worcester after Harriet F. Burnside bequeathed US $5,000 to create a fountain to provide fresh water for people, horses and dogs, in the memory of her father, a prominent lawyer. The fountain was installed in 1912 in Central Square, then moved in 1969 to its current location on Worcester Common. In 1970 the statue was stolen, and was re-installed two years later. An attempted theft occurred in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The Great Famine in Ireland of the 1840s drove {{migrants}} {{across the}} Irish Sea, and many {{settled in the}} industrial cities of the North, especially Manchester and Liverpool – at the 1851 census, 13% {{of the population of}} Manchester and Salford were Irish-born, and in Liverpool <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>was</b> 22%. In response there was a wave of anti-Catholic riots and Protestant Orange Orders proliferated across Northern England, chiefly in Lancashire, but also elsewhere in the North. By 1881 there were 374 Orange organisations in Lancashire, 71 in the North East, and 42 in Yorkshire. From further afield, Northern England saw immigration from European countries such as Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Scandinavia, and from East Asia and Africa. Some immigrants were well-to-do industrialists seeking to do business in the booming industrial cities, some were escaping poverty, some were servants or slaves, some were sailors who chose to settle in the port towns, some were Jews fleeing pogroms on the continent, and some were migrants originally stranded at Liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to the United States or to colonies of the British Empire. At the same time, hundreds of thousands from depressed rural areas of the North emigrated, chiefly to the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{factors in the}} decline of coal {{were related to the}} massive {{under-investment}} in Rhondda mines over the past decades. Most of the mines in the valleys were sunk between the 1850s and 1880s, which, as a consequence, meant they were far smaller than most modern mines. The Rhondda mines were in comparison antiquated, with methods of ventilation, coal-preparation and power supply all of a poor standard. In 1945 the British coal industry cut 72 per cent of their output mechanically, whereas in South Wales <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>was</b> just 22 per cent. The only way to ensure the financial survival of the mines in the valleys was massive investment from the NCB, but the 'Plan for Coal' paper drawn up in 1950 was overly optimistic in the future demand for coal, which was drastically reduced following an industrial recession in 1956 and an increased availability of oil.|$|E
