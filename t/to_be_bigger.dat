25|$|Although {{the types}} of prey Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica forage are almost the same, that of Vespula germanica are {{generally}} 2–3.5 times bigger and heavier than that of Vespula vulgaris. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the Vespula germanica foragers are bigger in morphology than those of Vespula vulgaris, and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> {{to be able to}} hold larger prey.|$|E

25|$|The {{discriminant}} of K can {{be referred}} to as the absolute discriminant of K to distinguish it from the relative discriminant of an extension K/L of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of L, and like the absolute discriminant it indicates which primes are ramified in K/L. It is a generalization of the absolute discriminant allowing for L <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> than Q; in fact, when L=Q, the relative discriminant of K/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant of K.|$|E

[...] "Victory of the Daleks" [...] was seen by 8.2 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD, placing second for the night it aired.

500|$|The {{third and}} final film in the trilogy, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), {{received}} a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims, as Six says [...] "each film is {{a reaction to the}} other. And the film got so big, it was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and things… it had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> and bigger. And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself." [...] As Full Sequence was intended to make First Sequence look like My Little Pony in comparison, Final Sequence was intended to make Full Sequence resemble a Disney film. The movie features the tag-line [...] "100% Politically Incorrect". Both Dieter Laser and Full Sequence star Laurence R. Harvey returned in starring, albeit different, roles.|$|E

In a press release on their official website, the album is described as [...] "a killer hybrid of rock, pop, funk and R." [...] The band's frontman Adam Levine described Mutt as one of the most successful producers who have ever lived. Jesse Carmichael, the band’s keyboardist, said, [...] "Mutt really helped us play to the best of our ability. And it drove us <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> and better than ever." [...] Hands All Over was released on September 21, 2010 in the United States. It received generally favorable reviews from music critics and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of {{construction}} of the DRR, in the hope of saving money by buying already-existing trains for the attraction, Walt Disney tried to buy a set of [...] gauge ridable miniature locomotives from William [...] "Billy" [...] Jones, but after Jones declined his offer, Disney decided that he wanted the railroad's rolling stock <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> and made from scratch. For this task, Disney again turned to Roger Broggie, who was confident that he and the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop team could use the design for Disney's 1:8-scale miniature Lilly Belle locomotive and enlarge it to build the DRR's locomotives. The exact size of the rolling stock for the new railroad was determined after Disney saw a set of narrow-gauge Oahu Railway and Land Company passenger cars that had recently arrived at the Travel Town Museum, whose dimensions Disney found to be favorable. The scale of the design for the DRR's passenger cars, based on the [...] narrow-gauge passenger cars at the Travel Town Museum, was nominally 5:8-scale when compared to the size of [...] rolling stock. The same scale was also chosen for the steam locomotives planned for the DRR, and when its locomotives and passenger cars were completed and paired with its [...] narrow-gauge track, the railroad had nearly identical proportions to those of a conventional standard gauge railroad.|$|E
500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I {{made up my mind}} to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger.</b> This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan did not look up Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane will have to come clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reproducing females {{become the}} {{dominant}} female, usually, by founding new colonies, fighting for the dominant position, or taking over once the reproducing female dies. These reproducing females tend to have longer bodies than that of their non-reproducing counterparts of the same skull width. Interestingly enough, the measurements of females before they became reproductive and after show significant increases in body size. It is believed that this trait does not occur due to pre-existing morphological differences but to the actual attainment of the dominant female position. As with the reproductive females, the reproductive males also appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> in size than their non-reproducing counterparts {{but not as much}} so {{as in the case of}} the females.
