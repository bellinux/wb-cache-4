5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to <b>talcum</b> powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets {{to determine if they}} share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of the}} Solar System's formation.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a <b>talcum</b> powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

25|$|Much of the Martian {{surface is}} deeply covered by dust {{as fine as}} <b>talcum</b> powder. The global {{predominance}} of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over {{many areas of the}} planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the iron(III) oxide-hydroxide mineral goethite.|$|E
25|$|Talc can {{sometimes}} be contaminated with asbestos due to the proximity of asbestos ore (usually tremolite) in underground talc deposits. By 1973, US federal law required all talc products to be asbestos-free, and today there is strict quality control {{in the production of}} talc products, separating cosmetic-grade talc (e.g. <b>talcum</b> powder) from industrial-grade talc (often used in friction products) has largely eliminated this issue for consumers.|$|E
25|$|Anshan is rich {{in other}} mineral wealth too. The {{southern}} and south eastern areas of Anshan are rich in magnesite.

Anshan also has the world's largest reserve of <b>talcum,</b> accounting for fully one third of the entire world supply. The Xiuyan area of Anshan is known for the production of the precious stone, Jade. The largest single jade stone ever found came from Xiuyan, now carved into the form of a Buddha, it is a major tourist attraction in the area.|$|E
25|$|Sited on {{the edge}} of the Liao River plains, Anshan has wide flat lands in the west and central regions that develop into hilly and the mountainous terrain on the eastern fringes. The area is rich in mineral wealth {{including}} iron ore, coal, magnesite, <b>talcum</b> and jade. The plains of western Anshan are good for agriculture. The large flat fields make it ideal for modern agricultural methods. In total, Anshan contains 24480 hectares of arable land accounting for 26.4% of the total land area. One agricultural product that Anshan has become well known for is the production of Nangua Pears.|$|E
500|$|Physical {{pest control}} {{involves}} trapping or killing pests such as insects and rodents. Historically, local people or paid rat-catchers caught and killed rodents using dogs and traps. On a domestic scale, sticky flypapers {{are used to}} trap flies. In larger buildings, insects may be trapped using such means as pheromones, synthetic volatile chemicals or ultraviolet light to attract the insects; some have a sticky base or an electrically charged grid to kill them. Glueboards are sometimes used for monitoring cockroaches and to catch rodents. Rodents can be killed by suitably baited spring traps and can be caught in cage traps for relocation. <b>Talcum</b> powder or [...] "tracking powder" [...] {{can be used to}} establish routes used by rodents inside buildings and acoustic devices can be used for detecting beetles in structural timbers.|$|E

She entered the stage in a procession inspired by a Japanese wedding, and as the lights dimmed, she sat at her piano on the rotating stage and belted out [...] "Speechless", which {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Alejandro", where she was picked up by one of her dancers, who appeared to be covered in <b>talcum</b> powder. Gaga taped a medley of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Alejandro" [...] for the ninth season of American Idol on April 28, 2010. Her performance aired on the show's May 5, 2010 episode. The performance started with Gaga playing the piano for a slowed-down snippet of [...] "Bad Romance". She was dressed in a revealing-but-veiled black outfit, wielding a cape and was surrounded by shirtless dancers. Halfway through the performance, she shed her cape and began writhing on the floor. Over {{in one corner of the}} stage, a statue of the Virgin Mary had flames pouring out of the top of it, as Gaga sang the chorus. Fog filled the stage, as Gaga and her dancers performed an energetic dance routine. Luchina Fisher from ABC News called it a [...] "thinly-veiled performance dripping with sex and violins" [...] and [...] "Gaga doing her best Madonna impression." [...] On July 9, 2010, the song was performed on The Today Show, where she sang it on a stage, outside the studio.

500|$|Following the {{break-up}} {{of their previous}} band Mythology in 1968, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston, Birmingham. They enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: [...] "Ozzy Zig Needs Gig â€“ has own PA". The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band, the name taken either from a brand of <b>talcum</b> powder or an Indian/Pakistani clothing shop; the exact origin is confused. The Polka Tulk Blues Band included slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne's, and saxophonist Alan [...] "Aker" [...] Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band again changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated) and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke. Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece. While the band was performing under the Earth title, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as [...] "The Rebel", [...] "Song for Jim", and [...] "When I Came Down". The demo titled [...] "Song for Jim" [...] was in reference to Jim Simpson. Jim Simpson was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea & Symphony. Simpson was also a trumpet player for the group Locomotive. Simpson had recently opened a new pub named Henry's Blues House and offered to let Earth play some gigs in his club. The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth.|$|E

An editorial that followed used the story to protest the feminization of American men, and blamed the <b>talcum</b> powder on Valentino and his films. The piece infuriated Valentino and he challenged the writer to a boxing match since dueling was illegal. Neither challenge was answered. Shortly afterward, Valentino met with journalist H.L. Mencken for advice {{on how best to}} deal with the incident. Mencken advised Valentino to [...] "let the dreadful farce roll along to exhaustion," [...] but Valentino insisted the editorial was [...] "infamous."

2500|$|In the copal {{hardening}} process, the resin {{is wrapped}} in aluminum foil, then {{treated in the}} autoclave for several hours, increasing the temperature, pressure and heating time. Green or other colors are obtained by adding water at each stage of the process. After the copal has hardened, the aluminum foil is removed and the hardened resin is cut to produce the desired shape (i.e. bead or cabochon). It is then mixed with <b>talcum</b> and heated again in the autoclave. Thereafter, it can [...] be cut and polished to obtain the desired finish.|$|E
2500|$|Analysis of {{the soil}} samples {{collected}} by the Viking landers in 1976 indicate iron-rich clays consistent with weathering of basaltic rocks. There {{is some evidence that}} some portion of the Martian surface might be more silica-rich than typical basalt, perhaps similar to andesitic rocks on Earth, though these observations may also be explained by silica glass, phyllosilicates, or opal. [...] Much of the surface is deeply covered by dust as fine as <b>talcum</b> powder. The red/orange appearance of Mars' surface is caused by iron(III) oxide (rust). Mars has twice as much iron oxide in its outer layer as Earth does, despite their supposed similar origin. It is thought that Earth, being hotter, transported much of the iron downwards in the [...] deep, , lava seas of the early planet, while Mars, with a lower lava temperature of [...] was too cool for this to happen.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that all of ancient Africa possessed a multitude of water-spirit traditions before the first contact with Europeans. Most of these were regarded as female. Dual natures {{of good and evil}} were not uncommon, reflecting the fact that water is an important means of providing communication, food, drink, trade, and transportation, but it can drown people, flood fields or villages, and provide passage to intruders. Van Stipriaan suggests that she may be based on the West African manatee, which is an idea that has been proposed by scientists of the Ghanaian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR); in fact, [...] "Mami Wata" [...] is a common name for this animal in the region. Jill Salmons argues that the mermaid image may have come into being after contact with Europeans. The ships of traders and slavers often had carvings of mermaid figures on their prows, for example, and tales of mermaids were popular among sailors of the time. On the other hand, white is traditionally associated with the spirit world in many cultures of Nigeria. The people of the Cross River area often whiten their skin with <b>talcum</b> or other substances for rituals and for cosmetic reasons, for example.|$|E
2500|$|Mousquetaire gloves have buttons at {{the wrist}} so the wearer {{could open the}} buttons and slip her hand out without taking the whole glove off. The finger section would be folded in and kept away tidily. This is how ladies wore gloves while dining. After the meal they would put their hands back into the gloves, usually {{for the rest of}} the evening. During the 19th century, {{especially}} from the mid-Victorian era onwards, gloves were tailored so as to fit very tightly onto the hands and armsso tightly, in fact, that it was often necessary to use aids such as <b>talcum</b> powder and buttonhooks to put on one's gloves; therefore, it was considered somewhat uncouth to put on or remove one's gloves completely in public and women would make sure to don their gloves in the privacy of their homes before going out to some event (another reason for the popularity of the mousquetaire opening). The mousquetaire opening/fastening for women's long gloves seems to have become most popular during the Victorian era; during the Napoleonic/Regency period, women's long gloves were often tailored to fit loosely on the wearer's arm, and were often worn gathered below the elbow or held up on the biceps with a garter-like strap. (In the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice, Rosamund Pike and several other actresses wear opera-length gloves with drawstring ties at the top of the glove, but this might not be an accurate representation of the style of long gloves in the Regency era; fashion plates from the period do not appear to show gloves with drawstring-type ties, but do often show women wearing gloves held up by garterlike straps or ribbons.) ...|$|E

60|$|But he {{was reading}} the full report which many men had written on the ground. A white man had been there, he learned, {{and a number of}} blacks. Here a black had climbed a coconut tree and cast down the nuts. There a banana tree had been despoiled of its {{clustered}} fruit; and, beyond, it was evident that a similar event had happened to a breadfruit tree. One thing, however, puzzled him--a scent new to him that was neither black man's nor white man's. Had he had the necessary knowledge and the wit of eye-observance, he would have noted that the footprint was smaller than a man's and that the toeprints were different from a Mary's in that they were close together and did not press deeply into the earth. What bothered him in his smelling was his ignorance of <b>talcum</b> powder. Pungent it was in his nostrils, but never, since first he had smelled out the footprints of man, had he encountered such a scent. And with this were combined other and fainter scents that were equally strange to him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was due to}} Ruth, too, {{that they}} had so amiable a flat. Carl had been made {{careless}} of surroundings by years of hotels and furnished rooms. There was less real significance {{for him in the}} beauty of his first home than in the fact that they two had a bath-room of their own; that he no longer had to go, clad in a drab bath-robe, laden with shaving materials and a towel and <b>talcum</b> powder and a broken hand-mirror and a tooth-brush, like a perambulating drug-store toilet-counter, down a boarding-house hall to that modified hall bedroom with a tin tub which his doctor-landlord had called a bath-room. Pictures, it must be admitted, give a room an air; pleasant it is to sit in large chairs by fireplaces and feel yourself a landed gentleman. But nothing filled Carl with a more delicate--and truly spiritual--satisfaction than having a porcelain tub, plenty of hot water, and the privilege of leaving his shaving-brush in the Ericson bath-room with a fair certainty of finding it there when he wanted to shave in a hurry.|$|E
