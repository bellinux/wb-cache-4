This report reviews additional matters identified during GAO's fiscal year 2000 audit regarding accounting procedures and internal controls that could be improved. GAO found that IRS had immaterial internal control issues that affected reporting. IRS (1) was unable to determine if its costs for reimbursable activities were accurate and whether it was recouping the costs of the goods or services it provided, (2) lacked procedures to properly record its working capital fund prepaid expenses, (3) accepted information from its contractors for inclusion in its year-end financial reporting without sufficient oversight or review, and (4) did not always follow standard procedures with respect to the <b>transfer</b> of funds <b>between</b> <b>appropriations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Nonexpenditure {{transactions}} {{are defined as}} transactions that do not represent payments for goods and services, but serve only to adjust amounts available in accounts. They include transfers of appropriations (based on appropriation warrants), which increase or decrease <b>appropriation</b> amounts <b>between</b> <b>appropriation</b> and fund accounts {{as a result of}} legislation. These transfers must be authorized by law and are accomplished via SF 1151 : Nonexpenditure Transfer (NET) Authorization. 1 Nonexpenditure transfers must occur within the same fund group. That is, any <b>transfer</b> that occurs <b>between</b> funds within the Federal fund group 2 (i. e. <b>transfers</b> <b>between</b> general, special and revolving funds) is to be classified as nonexpenditure. Likewise, any <b>transfer</b> <b>between</b> two trust funds is to be classified as nonexpenditure. There are four main groups of nonexpenditure transfers. These groups are...|$|R

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{considers the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} differences between appropria-tions and outlays {{and the implications of}} these differences for analyses of public budget-ing in the United States. The research focuses on two questions: (1) What is the relationship <b>between</b> <b>appropriations</b> and outlays over time in different budgetary functions? and (2) What is the consequence of using appropriations or outlays in analyses of budgetary change? Results indicate that the relationship <b>between</b> <b>appropriations</b> and outlays varies quite considerably (and surprisingly) across functions and that the differences matter quite a lot, at least in certain areas. Indeed, whether one uses appropriations or outlays may lead one to draw very different conclusions about the politics of public budgeting. Bud-getary measures, it appears, really matter...|$|R
2500|$|The Foundation {{said that}} the government's call for a {{distinction}} to [...] "be recognized <b>between</b> <b>appropriations</b> for 'Congressional programs' and 'general budget appropriations' made to fund executive operations", was not recognized conceptually or legally. They said the government had cited [...] "no decision that recognizes such a distinction <b>between</b> Congressional <b>appropriation</b> bills, nor is the distinction <b>between</b> Congressional <b>appropriation</b> bills, nor is the distinction provided with any conceptual plausibility." [...] They said [...] "The Constitution does not distinguish <b>between</b> Congressional <b>appropriations</b> made to administrative 'spending programs' and Congressional budget appropriations made to the executive branch. All appropriations require Congressional legislative action. The Congressional 'power of the purse' refers to this exclusive power of Congress to appropriate funds, which power derives from specific provisions of the Constitution, including Article I, § 8, which empowers Congress to 'pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States.' The Appropriations Clause, Article I, § 9, Cl. 7, further provides that 'no Money shall {{be drawn from the}} Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'" ...|$|R
50|$|In practice, the {{separation}} between policy making and funding and the division <b>between</b> <b>appropriations</b> and authorization activities are imperfect. Authorizations for many programs have long lapsed, yet still receive appropriated amounts, while other programs that are authorized receive no funds at all. In addition, policy language, which is legislative text changing permanent law, is included in appropriation measures.|$|R
