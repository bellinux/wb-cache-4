500|$|In {{contrast}} to the levity on their first train ride, the company was downcast and exhausted en route from Cleveland to Boston for the final tryouts. The show opened previews in Boston on May 6. A majority of the Boston critics liked the show, and expressed confidence that Rodgers and Hammerstein could fix {{the problems with the}} plot. The pair took out one song, [...] "Meat and Potatoes", which was felt to be too raunchy. After watching it performed by Joan McCracken, who played Betty (Carmen in the play-within-the-play), the pair decided it had too many double entendres and cut it. It was replaced by [...] "We Deserve Each Other", which the pair had written in a Cleveland hotel room. Another cut song, [...] "You Never Had It So Good", included lyrics which satirized the duo's own earlier efforts. Its lyrics, [...] "I'll sew, I'll bake / I'll try to make your evenings all enchanted. / My honeycake, / I'm yours to take, but don't <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> granted", alluded to two songs from South Pacific, [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun". Audiences continued to greet the show warmly.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song opens with a distinctive, Bach-inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's chorus. Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by {{a variation on the}} song's introduction, which then fades out. The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band's rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial radio stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long. Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes. The lead vocal on The Byrds' version of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan. The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997: [...] "I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him, 'Hey, God, <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a trip and I'll follow you.' It was a prayer of submission." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea that}} fanbases could be betrayed was first {{expressed}} in the season 2 episode [...] "Don't <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>For</b> Granted", in which Lucas says that a girl is [...] "slipping away" [...] {{and he needs to}} confess his love for her, but shows up at Brooke's house instead of Peyton's. Most viewers (including Lucas-Peyton and Brooke-Lucas fans) could not relate the [...] "slipping away" [...] line to Brooke, since Peyton had been the girl Lucas was in love with in season 1 and had since become estranged from him. Sources cited fans as pondering four questions: When was Brooke slipping away? Did Lucas simply mean {{he did not want to}} lose her? Was it a plot device to make it seem like Peyton? Or was it Peyton? Speculation that Murray and Bush's marriage affected Lucas's sudden change of heart, including whether or not Brooke and Lucas would be together, was also rampant.

2500|$|Then Vishnu, the omniscient {{director}} of the cosmic game, staged a small comedy. He transformed Nandi (the bull of Shiva) into a dancing bull and conducted {{him in front of}} Gajasura, assuming, at the same time, the appearance of a flutist. The enchanting performance of the bull sent the demon into ecstasies, and he asked the flutist to tell him what he desired. The musical Vishnu responded: [...] "Can you give me that which I ask?" [...] Gajasura replied: [...] "Who do you <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>for?</b> I can immediately give you whatever you ask." [...] The flutist then said: [...] "If that's so, liberate Shiva from your stomach." [...] Gajasura understood then that this must have been no other than Vishnu himself, {{the only one who could}} have known that secret and he threw himself at his feet. Having agreed to liberate Shiva, Gajasura asks him for two last gifts: [...] "I have been blessed by you with many gifts; my last requests are that everyone should remember me adoring my head and you should wear my skin." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Paris {{still wanted}} to resist, most of France wanted {{an end to the}} war as soon as possible. Thiers was a {{candidate}} in the elections, and won in twenty-six different departments, with a [...] total of two million votes. He chose to represent a seat in Paris. The majority of the two hundred newly elected deputies favored a constitutional monarchy, though it is also included a substantial group of republicans, including Victor Hugo. At the first session, Jules Grévy, a republican sympathetic to Thiers, was elected president of the assembly, with 519 votes of the 536 voting. On 14 February the Assembly voted to pass the powers of the Government of National Defense to the new Assembly. On 17 February, on a proposition by Grévy, Thiers was elected the Chef du pouvoir executive, or Chief Executive of the government. He asked the Assembly that the words [...] "Of the French Republic" [...] be added to his title. [...] "i have great admiration for cooks," [...] he told the Assembly. [...] "They call them Chefs. You have named me the Chef of the Executive Power. Do you <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a cook? Do you take France for a kitchen?" [...] The deputies laughed and agreed to the addition. The new government was promptly recognized by Britain, Italy, Austria, and Russia. For the first time since 1852, France was once again officially a republic.|$|E

Money and things are what interest her. Jack didn't give her these fast enough in the early stages of their marriage, which is partly why it turned sour. It also went wrong because of sex: he just didn't turn her on...or didn't turn her on enough. And she never stops reminding him of how much of a man he isn't.

2500|$|The {{property}} behind Stimson House (on Chester Place) was {{the home}} of Carrie Estelle Doheny, the widow of wealthy oil man, Edward L. Doheny. [...] Mrs. Doheny {{had grown up in}} the neighborhood and had watched as the Stimson House was built. [...] She recalled, [...] "I remember when Mr. Stimson was building this house. [...] When I was just a little girl, my father would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a walk on Sunday afternoons, and we’d always walk this way to see how far along the work had progressed." [...] For eight years from 1940 to 1948, Mrs. Doheny lived behind the fraternity, and the boisterous parties in the house’s dungeon-like [...] "catacombs" [...] were an ongoing source of annoyance. [...] Mrs. Doheny repeatedly complained to the university president, Rufus B. Von Kleinsmid, about disturbances, a former house president recalling that he was called before Kleinsmid [...] "once a month or so" [...] {{as a result of her}} complaints. [...] By 1948, Mrs. Doheny had dealt with the fraternity for long enough and offered $75,000 to purchase the house that the fraternity bought eight years earlier for $20,000. [...] The fraternity house was already struggling with the cost of maintaining the large house and accepted Mrs. Doheny’s offer. [...] After the sale closed, Mrs. Doheny assured herself that she would have no further problems with noisy neighbors by deeding Stimson House to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet for use as a convent. [...] At the time, the Los Angeles Times noted: [...] "The parlor where merry parties reveled at the turn of the century will become a chapel where reverent nuns will now bow in humble devotion. [...] The gay conversation of the festive past will yield place to solemn intonations of morning prayers." ...|$|E
