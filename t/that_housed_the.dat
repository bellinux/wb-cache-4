5|$|Research {{started by}} Count Gabriel de La Rochefoucauld, {{which had been}} {{interrupted}} by the war, uncovered a buried part of the castle dating to the 12th and 13th centuries, including the room <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> drawbridge mechanism.|$|E
5|$|A {{temple was}} {{constructed}} in AD60–70, and a bathing complex was built up over the next 300years. Engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, the spring was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).|$|E
50|$|The College of Teacher Development is the {{undergraduate}} {{school of the}} university that offers bachelor's degree in early childhood education, elementary education, and secondary education with various fields of specialization.

5|$|Neither the {{clockwork}} {{visible to}} {{the left side of the}} machine nor the drawer <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} was then {{deposited in the}} temple <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> Treasury (the aerarium). While a senatus auctoritas (vetoed Senate motion) had no legal value, it did serve to show {{the opinion of the}} Senate. If a senatus consultum conflicted with a law (lex) that was passed by a Roman Assembly, the law overrode the senatus consultum, because the senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A senatus consultum, however, could serve to interpret a law.|$|E
5|$|Hardenbergh's {{design was}} {{described}} as employing both Gothic elements and classical forms that preceded the extreme eclecticism that was to mark a later Victorian Gothic Revival period. The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick, but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built {{on the south side}} of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) the year before. The third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.|$|E

5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E
5|$|The park {{celebrates the}} early {{political}} {{history of the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. It features replicas of three buildings that stood on the original city square, including the courthouse that housed ten constitutional conventions between 1785 and 1792; these conventions ultimately led to Kentucky's separation from Virginia. It also includes the original building <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> first U.S. post office west of the Allegheny Mountains and several other early 19th century buildings of historical import. The site comprises {{the majority of the}} Constitution Square Historic District which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1976. Among the annual events held at the site are the Great American Brass Band Festival and the Kentucky State Barbecue Festival.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November, Vizeadmiral Prince Heinrich, who had {{replaced}} Hoffmann as the I Squadron commander, raised his flag aboard Kaiser Friedrich III; the ship held the role as squadron flagship {{for the next}} three years, interrupted only during the annual fleet exercises conducted in August and September, when Admiral Hans von Koester, the Generalinspekteur der Marine (Inspector-General of the Navy), commanded the fleet from Kaiser Wilhelm II. Through November, the ships of the squadron were occupied with individual training. On 17 November 1900, Kaiser Friedrich III was steaming to Kiel after conducting training exercises. Kaiser Wilhelm II attempted to pass Kaiser Friedrich III, so the latter stopped and allowed the former to pass to port. However, the order to resume steaming was given too quickly, and the ship accidentally rammed Kaiser Wilhelm II. Kaiser Friedrich III suffered minor damage to her bow, while her sister was slightly damaged in the compartment <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> steering engines. Repairs were completed within three days, without the need for either vessel to enter drydock. On 4 December, the ships began a winter training cruise, during which they stopped in Larvik, Norway, from 10 to 12 December. The squadron returned to Germany three days later.|$|E

5|$|The {{first three}} seasons of Prison Break were {{primarily}} filmed outside of Hollywood. The {{majority of the}} first season of the series was filmed on location in and around Chicago. After it was closed down in 2002, Joliet Prison became the set of Prison Break in 2005, standing in as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen. Scenes set in Lincoln's cell, the infirmary, and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison. Lincoln's cell was alleged {{to be the same}} one in which serial killer John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated, which at least one member of the production crew refused to enter, because it was alleged to be haunted. Other sets were built at the prison, including the cell blocks <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> general prison population; these blocks had three tiers of cells (as opposed to the real cell block's two) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras. Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around Chicago, Woodstock, and Joliet in Illinois. Other locations included O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Prison Break spent $2 million per episode in the state of Illinois, which cost them a total of $24 million in 2005.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor, Armstrong oversaw many issues that {{concerned}} the city. In March 1911, he expressed his support for a new city hall building to be built, expressing his dissatisfaction with the existing building <b>that</b> <b>housed</b> <b>the</b> council and civic employees, mentioning the ever-expanding number of staff. Later in that year, a committee would be formed concerning the issue, and a new structure would be planned with a planned cost of one million dollars. In July of that same year, he would sign a bylaw that would allow an American entrepreneur to establish a gas plant in the city, an issue that had been presented to council for debate several months prior. Later that year, {{the prospect of a}} municipal gas plant would also be supplied to city council. In July 1911, when, along with the city council, he dismissed a pair of city commissioners after months of debate. The firing triggered a by-election when alderman James H. McKinley would resign in protest to the action. In 1911, he also served as {{a vice president of the}} Union of Alberta Municipalities. Involved in national and provincial affairs, he voiced his support for a canal to be constructed in the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, stating that the presence of such canal would improve the trading relations of Canada with the United States by allowing an easier route between the two countries. He also was in favour of a hydroelectric project in the Athabasca River. Additionally, during t{{his first term}} as mayor, Armstrong also oversaw the city's festivities on George V's coronation and moved to form a municipal purchasing department.|$|E
