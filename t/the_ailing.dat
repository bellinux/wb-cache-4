Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path of discipline and control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects of public life.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} enter (invade) {{eucaryotic}} cells is a property common to many pathogenic bacteria. Yersinia enterocolitica is a facultative intracellular pathogen whose primary site of multiplication is the reticuloendothelial system. In {{an effort to}} understand how Y. enterocolitica crosses the intestinal epithelial cell layer, we previously reported the cloning of two loci from Y. enterocolitica that individually conferred an invasive phenotype to the normally noninvasive Escherichia coli HB 101. One of these loci, ail, is encoded by a region of DNA that is less than 650 base pairs. We have identified <b>the</b> <b>ail</b> gene product in maxicells as a 17 -kilodalton membrane-associated protein. <b>The</b> <b>Ail</b> protein has been purified, and its N-terminal sequence has been determined. The nucleotide sequence of <b>the</b> <b>ail</b> gene revealed a single unique open reading frame of 178 amino acids. Comparison of amino acid sequences deduced from the gene and obtained by analysis of the purified protein identified the first 23 amino acids as a signal sequence. The site(s) at which transcription initiates on <b>the</b> <b>ail</b> gene was identified by primer extension analysis and shown to be identical in E. coli and Y. enterocolitica. Two small open reading frames downstream of ail were found and shown to exhibit considerable identity to the proposed IS 3 transposase...|$|R

5|$|In late September {{or early}} October 1942, Baćović and Jevđević held talks with Muslim leader Ismet Popovac {{and agreed to}} recruit Muslims into the Chetnik ranks. Popovac's Muslim Chetnik militia later fought the Partisans during the Axis-led Case White {{offensive}} in early 1943, but did not distinguish itself. By December 1943, an estimated 4,000 (or eight percent) of Mihailović's Chetniks were Muslim. In November and December 1942, the Italians helped about 4,000 of Baćović's Chetniks in Herzegovina relocate to northern Dalmatia and Lika with another 4,000 to be relocated later.

40|$|Background: Yersinia enterocolitica is an enteric {{pathogen}} that invades the intestinal mucosa and proliferates within the lymphoid follicles (Peyer’s patches). The attachment invasion locus (ail) mediates invasion by Y. enterocolitica and confers an invasive phenotype upon non-invasive E. coli; <b>ail</b> is <b>the</b> primary virulence factor of Y. enterocolitica. The ferrioxamine receptor (foxA) {{located on the}} Y. enterocolitica chromosome, together with its transport protein, transports a siderophore specific for ferric ion. Currently, <b>ail</b> is <b>the</b> primary target gene for nucleic acid detection of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica. Results: <b>The</b> genes <b>ail</b> and foxA in 271 pathogenic and 27 non-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains isolated from China and 10 reference strains were sequenced, aligned, compared to <b>the</b> <b>ail</b> and foxA sequences of Yersinia enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081 (Genbank: NC_ 008800), and analyzed for sequence polymorphism. <b>The</b> <b>ail</b> from <b>the</b> 282 strains showed 3 sequence patterns: 277 strains of serotypes O: 3, O: 9 and O: 5, 27 with identical nucleic acid sequences formed pattern A 1; 4 strains of serotype 1 B/O: 8 with identical nucleic acid sequences formed pattern A 2; and one Chinese isolate 2 /O: 9 formed pattern A 3. In the primary coding region of the foxA ORF (Genebank: X 60447 nt 433 - 1866; nt 28 to 1, 461 in the ORF), the sequences formed 3 groups and were further divided into 8 sequence patterns.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Young Turk Revolution deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{and a series}} of wars plagued <b>the</b> <b>ailing</b> empire's capital.

The Armenian population of the city was also affected by the deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915, in which leaders of the Armenian community were arrested and mostly killed as part of the Armenian Genocide. To commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide, 24 April has now become the day of remembrance. The final Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI, was exiled in November 1922 by Atatürk; the following year, the occupation of Constantinople ended with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne and the recognition of the Republic of Turkey, declared by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.|$|E
5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of <b>the</b> <b>ailing</b> French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E

40|$|Although {{adhesion}} to host {{cells is}} a critical step {{in the delivery of}} cytotoxic Yop proteins by Yersinia pestis, the mechanism has not been defined. To identify adhesins critical for Yop delivery, we initiated two transposon mutagenesis screens using the mariner transposon. To avoid redundant cell binding activities, we initiated the screen with a strain deleted for two known adhesins, pH 6 antigen and the autotransporter, YapC, as well as the Caf 1 capsule, which is known to obscure some adhesins. The mutants that emerged contained insertions within <b>the</b> <b>ail</b> (attachment and invasion locus) gene of Y. pestis. A reconstructed mutant with a single deletion in <b>the</b> <b>ail</b> locus (y 1324) was severely defective for delivery of Yops to HEp- 2 human epithelial cells and significantly defective for delivery of Yops to THP- 1 human monocytes. Specifically, the Yop delivery defect was apparent when cell rounding and translocation of an ELK-tagged YopE derivative into host cells were monitored. Although <b>the</b> <b>ail</b> mutant showed only a modest decrease in cell binding capacity in vitro, the KIM 5 Δail mutant exhibited a > 3, 000 -fold-increased 50 % lethal dose in mice.
