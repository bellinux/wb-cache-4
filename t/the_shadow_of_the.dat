5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, under the title In <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin {{was not interested}} in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to release the game for the console. In North America, Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood. Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Templars title.|$|E

5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi. As time passed, the Yasakani, tired of living in <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kusanagi, made a blood pact with Orochi. This gave them greater powers, but in return, they and their {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. In response, the Kusanagi declared war on the Yagami, which led to many clan members on both sides being killed.|$|E
