5|$|Hundreds {{of spectators}} had slept on wet {{pavements}} outside the stadium in rainy weather {{on the eve}} of the Test <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> for tickets.

5|$|Operation Stack is {{a traffic}} {{management}} {{system on the}} M20 through and near Ashford, which allows HGVs <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> for the Channel Tunnel and the Port of Dover when there is bad weather or industrial action. The scheme is controversial as it involves closing the entire eastbound motorway to through traffic. In 2013, Kent County Council sought funding to build a dedicated lorry park in Ashford.|$|E
5|$|After {{the match}} against Durham, Australia headed south to The Oval for the Fifth Test, which started on 14 August. Barnes and Tallon {{returned}} from injury, while Ernie Toshack was omitted with knee troubles, and the leg spin of Doug Ring replaced Johnson's off spin. Overnight, hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements in rainy weather <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> for tickets. Bradman had already {{announced that he}} would retire {{at the end of the}} season, and the public were anxious to witness his last Test appearance.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E

5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for every day since its opening, people have had <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had fortuitously pitted {{immediately prior to}} the safety car's deployment and was also fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following the pit stops, he was set to take the lead once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not pitted under the safety car conditions) pitted for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at the pit exit, pushing him over the white line separating the pit lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
5|$|The two Ferrari {{cars and}} the Renault of Kubica became the first cars <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> up behind the safety car, {{while the rest of}} the field had enough notice to divert to the pitlane for their first stop. The {{significance}} of these events was that both Vettel and Hamilton were able to make their first stops before their advantage over the rest of the field was cancelled out by catching the safety car, while Alonso, Massa and Kubica fell down the order. Hamilton's stop was for a replacement front wing. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 14 and the cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel locked his tyres and ran deep driving into the final turn, and resisted Hamilton's attempt at overtaking him. Alonso immediately pushed hard and passed Hülkenberg for ninth place at turn 17 on the 15th lap. A line of cars formed behind Kobayashi while Vettel and Hamilton pulled away from the rest of the field, as the front two began trading the fastest lap time of the event. Button gained a large amount of top speed but remained behind both Sauber cars. Schumacher passed both Virgin cars to move into the 17th position by lap 17.|$|E

The rate of credit accumulation and release can be adjusted on a queue-by-queue basis to produce a weighted queuing behavior.|$|R

According {{to the chairman}} of Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics, vessels now need <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> up outside of Hong Kong port for two to four days before being able to berth; the wait was negligible just before the strike. The association estimated 120,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) have accumulated since the strike action began two weeks earlier.|$|E
25|$|When Phase 3 {{registrations}} {{started on}} 30 August, {{there were still}} 6,000 available places across all primary schools in Singapore. Principals had advised parents against homing in on certain schools since all schools provide quality education. In spite of this, camping tents were set up at Tanjong Katong Primary School, maids were asked <b>to</b> <b>queue,</b> and parents came prepared with packets of food and blankets. On 29 August, MOE had informed the parents that the school had only one place left, and that place {{would go to the}} first person in the queue as balloting would not be carried out unlike in the earlier phases. Despite this, four of the original 11 parents continued to remain in the queue.|$|E

25|$|To {{get access}} to the show courts, fans will {{normally}} have <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> overnight. This is done by fans {{from all over the}} world and, although considered vagrancy, is part of the Wimbledon experience in itself. The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight. Tickets returned by people leaving early go on sale at 2:30pm and the money goes to charity. Queuing for the show courts ends after the quarter finals have been completed.|$|E
25|$|The Qbot is a {{handheld}} device which park guests can rent for the day. On the device, users can select an amusement ride they wish <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> {{for and the}} device will add them to a virtual queue. The Qbot device will notify users once their virtual queue time has elapsed through vibration and beeping. In 2011, the Qband was introduced for use at water parks. The device, which is similar in size and shape to a watch, functions similarly to the Qbot. Currently the Qband is used at waterparks around the world including: Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, Splish Splash, Wet'nWild Sydney, Raging Waters San Dimas. The Qsmart requires users to have a smartphone which they can use to join virtual queues in a similar method to the Qbot. It replaced the Q-txt product which allowed any mobile phone to register a spot in virtual queues.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of {{liberalisation}} in 2002/03, there were only 180 ADMARC outlets. By 2009/10, the number of ADMARC-operated markets had grown to 788, and in 2010/11 the figure rose to 904. It remains {{under the control of}} politicians, and this has led to claims of corruption and the public perception that ADMARC does not act {{in the best interests of}} those it is meant to assist. ADMARC expanded in the decade after 2002 and still exists because of the failure of the agro-dealer programme to create an efficient private sector marketing system. This does not mean that ADMARC is efficient, it was heavily criticised in early 2013 for allowing stored grain to rot in its silos as many went hungry for lack of maize in ADMARC markets. Had that maize been released on the market before it spoiled, it was claimed, it would have helped to lower prices and prevented many having <b>to</b> <b>queue</b> for scarce maize.|$|E
