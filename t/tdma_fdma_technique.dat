FCA requires manual frequency planning, which is an arduous task in <b>TDMA</b> and <b>FDMA</b> based systems since such systems are highly sensitive to co-channel interference from nearby cells that are reusing the same channel. Another drawback with <b>TDMA</b> and <b>FDMA</b> systems with FCA is {{that the number of}} channels in the cell remains constant irrespective of the number of customers in that cell. This results in traffic congestion and some calls being lost when traffic gets heavy in some cells, and idle capacity in other cells.|$|R

50|$|All {{radio access}} {{technologies}} have {{to solve the}} same problems: to divide the finite RF spectrum among multiple users as efficiently as possible. GSM uses <b>TDMA</b> and <b>FDMA</b> for user and cell separation. UMTS, IS-95 and CDMA-2000 use CDMA. WiMAX and LTE use OFDM.|$|R
30|$|It is {{also worth}} making the analogy with {{other types of}} {{channels}} where the ability to bridge the extremes of treating interference as noise and fully decoding interference has appeared. Considering a two-user SISO IC, interference is fully decoded in the strong interference regime and is treated as noise in the weak interference regime. Between those two extremes, interference is neither strong enough to be fully decoded nor weak enough to be treated as noise. The best known strategy for the two-user SISO IC is obtained using RS (so-called HK scheme). RS in this context is well known to be superior to strategies relying on fully treating interference as noise, fully decoding interference, or orthogonalization (<b>TDMA,</b> <b>FDMA)</b> [25, 35]. Limiting ourselves to those extremes strategies is suboptimal [25, 35].|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{a system where}} a number of indepen-dent, time-triggered or event-triggered control loops are closed over a shared communication network. Each plant is described by a first-order linear stochastic system. In the event-triggered case, a sensor at each plant frequently samples the output but attempts to communicate only when {{the magnitude of the}} output is above a threshold. Once access to the network has been gained, the network is busy for T seconds (corresponding to the communication delay from sensor to actuator), after which the control action is applied to the plant. Using numerical methods, we compute the minimum-variance control performance under various common MAC-protocols, including <b>TDMA,</b> <b>FDMA,</b> and CSMA (with random, dynamic-priority, or static-priority access).

Moreover, the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the uplink OFDM transmit signal can be greatly reduced if this OFDM-FDMA multiple access scheme is additionally combined with a data spreading technique based on a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) spreading matrix using only the user specific subcarriers.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} novel robust and {{self-organizing}} architecture for mobile ad hoc networks. The proposed architecture, space {{division multiple access}} (SDMA), relies on user position information and provides users access to the communication channel based on their spatial locations. SDMA divides the geographical space, where the users are located, into smaller spaces. The key element of the design is a one-to-one map between the space divisions and the bandwidth divisions of time slots, frequency divisions, etc. Therefore, SDMA is compatible with any multiple access scheme such as <b>TDMA,</b> <b>FDMA,</b> CDMA, etc. The system requirement is the user information of its position and a priori knowledge of the one-to-one map between the space divisions and the bandwidth divisions. The scheme is self-starting and self-maintaining. It provides collision-free access to the communication medium for the users, and thereby, facilitates ad hoc communication address resolution amongst the users. In addition, SDMA guarantees delay-bounded communication in real-time. The paper presents the SDMA architecture and discusses its advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, enhanced SDMA is discussed for increased bandwidth efficiency. Keywords — Vehicle Communication, Ad hoc Network, Medium Access Control, Address Resolutio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) {{transmission}} technique can efficiently deal with multi-path propagation effects especially in broadband radio channels. It {{also has a}} high degree of system flexibility in multiple access schemes by combining the conventional <b>TDMA,</b> <b>FDMA</b> and CDMA approaches with the OFDM modulation procedure which is particularly important in the uplink of a multi-user system. In OFDM-FDMA schemes carrier synchronization and the resulting subcarrier orthogonality plays an important role to avoid any multiple access interferences (MAI) in the base station receiver. An additional technical challenge in system design is the required amplifier linearity to avoid any non-linear effects caused by a large peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of an OFDM transmission signal. A specific OFDM-FDMA uplink procedure is proposed and will be designed in this paper which {{can be seen as a}} combination of a specific subcarrier spreading scheme and subcarrier selection process. The resulting transmit signal consists of a periodic extension and multiple repetition of all modulation symbols and leads therefore to an extremely low computation complexity in the transmitter. Furthermore, the transmit signal shows simultaneously a constant envelope to avoid any non-linear effects in the amplification process. This uplink scheme can be considered as a trade off between low computation complexity and system performance...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new cellular architecture for radio access, CDPA {{that can be}} applied to present and future cellular systems, independently of the cell size. It poses as an appealing alternative to systems based on classical bandwidth subdivision methods, namely <b>TDMA,</b> <b>FDMA</b> or CDMA. In these systems, parallelism of communications is achieved by subdividing the band width “a priori ” among cells. In CDPA no bandwidth sub division is operated. All cells and terminals use a single frequency channel and transmit packets on a slotted channel. Parallel transmission in different cells is achieved through the “capture ” capability. A dynamic polling mechanism, C-PRMA, managed by the base station, guarantees almost immediate re transmission of packets that are not captured, thus assuring that packets are eventually correctly received. Analytical evaluations show that CDPA has the potential to provide larger capacity than the other cited systems in the case of continuous traffic sources. Furthermore, as C-PRMA is inherently apt to sustain bursty traffic, the system capacity is easily doubled in the case of packetized voice transmission using silence suppression. The paper compares the performance of two channel access schemes suitable for the cellular environment, which, in particular allow the packet capture and can deal with inter-cell interference...|$|R

Based on the model provided by Dr. J. P. Linnartz, the simulations are done using Matlab in frequency domain. ^ It is shown in this research work that the performance of synchronous MC-CDMA employing CI codes is slightly inferior to that of employing Walsh-Hadamard codes, but that the difference is not significant. As CI codes can double the network capacity in terms of number of users without losing performance in terms of BER, we can conclude that CI codes are promising codes for synchronous downlink MC-CDMA even in fading channel environment.
