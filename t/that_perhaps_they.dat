5|$|As {{the pairs}} go their {{separate}} ways, an enforcer for the loan shark {{catches up with}} the duplicated pair {{to get the money}} back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money he and Stewie borrowed and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the real pair worry about getting caught Stewie suggest that they make a run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won.|$|E
25|$|Believing that Jane and Michael need {{personal}} growth, Mary {{decides to}} leave Cherry Tree Lane ("Chim Chim Cher-ee – Rooftop Duet"), {{to bring them}} to their senses. Her distraught charges find a note saying <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> will see Mary again eventually.|$|E
500|$|In addition, the {{nationalistic sentiments}} that {{exacerbated}} the naval arms race {{gave way to}} slowing economies and negative public opinions which came to support investing inside the country instead. Commenting on this, the United States' Minister to Chile, Henry Prather Fletcher, wrote to Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan: [...] "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> are much more in need of money than of battleships." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last she}} cried out, poignantly, [...] "They are not here. They have deserted us. What shall I do?" [...] She {{turned toward the}} table. [...] "Rebuild my altar. You said you would. Restore <b>that</b> and <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> will come to us again. They are angry with me now. They have left me, perhaps forever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm a-going, Davy, you see, to my brother's, first, {{for another}} fortnight's visit--just till I have {{had time to}} look about me, and get to be {{something}} like myself again. Now, I have been thinking <b>that</b> <b>perhaps,</b> as <b>they</b> don't want you here at present, you might be let to go along with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|ABSOLUTE O, most certainly--sure, now, this is {{much better}} than being in love!--ha! ha! ha!--there's some spirit in this!--What signifies {{breaking}} some scores of solemn promises:--all that's of no consequence, you know. To be sure people will say, that miss don't know her own mind--but never mind <b>that!</b> Or, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>they</b> may be ill-natured enough to hint, that the gentleman grew tired of the lady and forsook her--but don't let that fret you.|$|R
500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E
500|$|Astronomers at the time, {{including}} Edmond Halley, {{speculated that}} this comet was {{a return of}} a bright comet seen close to the Sun in the sky in 1106. 163 years later, the Great Comet of 1843 appeared and also passed extremely close to the Sun. Despite orbital calculations showing {{that it had a}} period of several centuries, some astronomers wondered if it was a return of the 1680 comet. [...] A bright comet seen in 1880 was found to be travelling on an almost identical orbit to that of 1843, as was the subsequent Great Comet of 1882. [...] Some astronomers suggested <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> were all one comet, whose orbital period was somehow being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage, perhaps by retardation by some dense material surrounding the Sun.|$|E
500|$|As {{they were}} walking home after the evening performance, Lennon and Shotton {{discussed}} the afternoon encounter with McCartney, and Lennon said <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> should invite McCartney to join the band. Two weeks later Shotton encountered McCartney cycling through Woolton, and conveyed Lennon's casual invitation for him to join the Quarrymen, and Vaughan also invited McCartney to join. McCartney said he would join after Scout camp in Hathersage, and a holiday with his family at Butlins holiday camp in Filey, Yorkshire. Shotton and Davis both left the Quarrymen in August, feeling that the group was moving away from skiffle and towards rock, leaving their instruments superfluous. When McCartney returned from holiday he began rehearsing with the Quarrymen, playing songs such as, [...] "Bye Bye Love" [...] (The Everly Brothers) and [...] "All Shook Up", that Lennon and the group {{had been trying to}} learn, without success.|$|E
60|$|To his {{disappointment}} the lad could hear {{nothing of the}} conversation which was going on within the hut. The murmur of voices came to his ear, but no words were audible; however, he remained patiently, thinking <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> as <b>they</b> came out a word might be said which {{would give him a}} clue to the object of the mysterious interview between a knight and one who was evidently a fugitive from justice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, I {{have heard}} young women talk like <b>that</b> before, though <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> think {{differently}} afterwards. Of course I {{have no right}} to obtrude myself, but when you are comfortably married, what is going to become of Honham I should like to know, and incidentally of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{sank into}} a quiet contemplation, till she said, [...] "It is best, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should be gone.--Yes--I see it is! Better {{that they should}} be plucked fresh than stay to wither away miserably!" ...|$|R
2500|$|She is also closely {{associated}} with the white mist that often surrounds the mountain. [...] While in just a few stories either her skin or hair is white, in most tales, it is her radiant clothing which makes people who have seen her think <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> just saw a wisp of cloud through the trees and mistook it for Maria.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{prolonged}} silence, Henry eventually dispatched {{a letter from}} Ceuta to Edward, arguing against fulfilling the treaty he had himself signed. [...] Henry noted that the skirmish on the beach exempted the Portuguese from fulfilling the agreement, and proposed instead <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> could swap Salah ibn Salah's son (still being held by Henry) for Prince Ferdinand. [...] But Edward himself received a note from the captive Ferdinand at the same time, reporting that the Marinids would accept nothing less than Ceuta, and wondering why {{it had not been}} evacuated yet. [...] It is clear from these letters, that, contrary to later legend (propagated by Henry himself), Ferdinand did not seek out a martyr's fate, that he expected the treaty to be fulfilled and to be swiftly released.|$|E
2500|$|The {{later stages}} of Pahawh became typologically more like Lao and the Roman alphabet, {{suggesting}} <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> influenced its evolution. However, {{even from the}} start, Pahawh is [...] "fascinatingly similar [...] and fascinatingly different" [...] from the Lao alphabet (Smalley et al. 1990:90). For example, it resembles an abugida such as Lao where the order of writing {{does not reflect the}} order of speech, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. There is an inherent vowel, as in Lao, though only on one tone, but also an inherent consonant. In Lao, tone depends on the consonant; it is modified with diacritics, but the patterns of modification are complex. In early Pahawh, tone depends on the rime and is modified with irregular diacritics. Starting with stage 2, there are two tone-classes of rime, just as in Lao there are two tone-classes of consonant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} of <b>that,</b> Wilfrid. Yes, <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> have guns. Well, you know, it has always been agreed that in case of danger three shots should be fired as a warning to those who might be out. If we fire and they hear it they will hurry back." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the moon}} had set, {{and only the}} summer stars threw their light into the great damp garden, she fancied that she heard voices in <b>that</b> direction. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> were the voices of Bob and Matilda taking a lover's walk before retiring. If so, how sleepy they would be next day, and how absurd it was of Matilda to pretend she was tired! Ruminating in this way, and saying to herself that she hoped they would be happy, Anne fell asleep.|$|R
25|$|This {{generation}} was active mostly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Tom Vague describes them as more vicious {{than their predecessors}} and says <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>perhaps</b> didn't have as much cause as the earlier generations to rebel.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Tanhuma {{taught that}} Moses prostrated himself before the Israelites {{and said to}} them the words of [...] "You are to pass over the Jordan," [...] noting that he would not. Moses gave the Israelites the {{opportunity}} to pray for him, but they did not. The Midrash compared this to a king who had many children by a noble lady. The lady was undutiful {{to him and he}} decided to divorce her. He told her {{that he was going to}} marry another wife. She asked who, and he told her. She summoned her children and told them that their father intended to divorce her and marry the other woman, and asked the children if they could bear being subjected to her. She thought <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> would understand what she meant and would intercede with their father on her behalf, but they did not understand. As they did not understand, she commanded them only for their own sake to be mindful of the honor of their father. So it was with Moses. When God told him in [...] "You shall not go over this Jordan," [...] Moses spoke to the Israelites and stressed the words in [...] "You are to pass over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once when Rabbi Hanina {{went out}} to the country, some villagers noted an {{apparent}} contradiction between two verses. [...] says: [...] "And the house which King Solomon built for the Lord, the length thereof was 60 cubits, and the breadth thereof 20 cubits, and the height thereof 30 cubits." [...] And [...] says: [...] "And before the Sanctuary which was 20 cubits in length, and 20 cubits in breadth, and 20 cubits in the height thereof." [...] Rabbi Hanina replied that [...] accounts for the space {{from the edge of the}} Cherubim upwards. The Gemara deduced that [...] thus teaches that the 10 cubits of space below (from the floor to the top of the Cherubim) was like the 20 cubits of space above (the Cherubim) in that neither space served any material purpose. (Both spaces were devoid of any structure.) This supports Rabbi Levi (or others say Rabbi Johanan), who said it is a tradition passed down from our fathers that the place of the Ark and the Cherubim is not included in the measured space (and miraculously they occupied none of the space of the Sanctuary). So, as well, it was taught in a Baraita that the Ark that Moses made had a free space of 10 cubits on every side (and miraculously occupied none of the space of the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle). Ravina said in the name of Samuel that the Cherubim made by Solomon stood by a miracle (and took up no space), for [...] says, [...] "And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits." [...] (The two Cherubim would thus have filled up the entire 20 cubits of the Sanctuary.) As the Sanctuary thus left no room for their bodies to stand, the Gemara inferred that they stood by a miracle. Abaye demurred that they might have been standing with their bodies under their wings like hens (whose wings touch each other on their backs, leaving their entire bodies covered by their wings). Rava demurred <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> did not stand opposite each another (and thus their wings overlapped). Rav Aha bar Jacob demurred that they might have stood diagonally. Rav Huna the son of Rav Joshua demurred that the house might have been wider above than below. Rav Papa demurred that their wings might have been bent. Rav Ashi demurred that their wings might have overlapped each other.|$|E
60|$|Upon hearing Sir Rowland's message {{his heart}} fainted, despite his good intentions, and he urged <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> had better {{hear what the}} baronet might have to say.|$|E
50|$|William Provost and {{his second}} wife, Maeijken Stevens, may have fled Antwerp in 1576 {{at the time of}} the Spanish Fury. However, this has not been confirmed. Indeed there are records for William Provost’s family in Antwerp up to 1584 (although no {{supporting}} evidence is given in <b>that</b> reference). <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> fled and then returned. At some time William Provost and his family seem to have moved to nearby Middelburg in the Province of Zeeland. Unfortunately Middelburg's archives were destroyed during World War II.|$|R
50|$|Miles offers Arde {{a chance}} to stay on with the Dendarii as a shuttle pilot but Arde refuses stating that that was drudge work. The only reason you {{put up with that}} was so you could jump. Miles then tells him there is a man who will lease the RG132 for a local space {{freighter}} and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> somewhere <b>they</b> may find a salvaged set of Necklin Rods for the ship. They both consider it a quest and a glimmer of hope for Arde.|$|R
6000|$|IT is {{not long}} since, here among all these folk in London, I should have held myself of no account whatever, but should have stood aside {{and made them}} way {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> had more right than I--for who was I? ...|$|R
60|$|They {{heard nothing}} of it, when Jim {{afterwards}} met {{one of the}} men in a public-house he did not mention a meeting, and they thought <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> had not been recognized. But the second time was worse.|$|E
60|$|He was favourably {{known to}} the merchants of Portsmouth, {{and thanks to the}} efforts of his friend, Andrew McCleary,--ten years his senior,--several tradesmen had intimated <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> might advance {{sufficient}} money to start the enterprise in a limited way.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have some}} food in our haversacks, sir. We breakfasted before we started, and we filled our haversacks with biscuits, {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> would be welcome, for {{we knew that}} none of the troops had anything to eat before leaving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As regards Julia, I do {{not know}} whether it may not be for the best. It seems to be a cruel thing to say, but of course I cannot but think most of her. You have heard, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have not been happy?" ...|$|R
50|$|Schottky's {{contributions}} in surface science/emission electronics and in semiconductor-device theory now form {{a significant and}} pervasive part of the background to these subjects. It could possibly be argued <b>that</b> - <b>perhaps</b> because <b>they</b> are {{in the area of}} technical physics - they are not as generally well recognized as they ought to be.|$|R
60|$|Mr Milvey smiled again, as {{he remarked}} to himself 'Those {{kings and queens}} were always wishing for children.' It {{occurring}} to him, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> had been Curates, their wishes might have tended in the opposite direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, my dear," [...] {{replied the}} Sea Serpent in a {{grateful}} voice. [...] "People who are always understood are very common. You {{are sure to}} respect those you can't understand, for you feel <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> know more than you do." ...|$|E
60|$|The art-students {{came down}} with Berry, who shook hands so cordially with him <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> could not help it. Miss Carver seemed to hesitate, but she gave him her hand too, and she asked, as the others had done, whether he had found his family well.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} {{they sat down}} to lunch. When Harry rejoined the others, he fancied he saw traces of tears {{in the eyes of}} Mrs. Lindsay and her daughter; and he thought <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> had been {{thinking}} that, if their own boys had lived, they also would be young men now.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} this singing style {{are not known}} and {{according}} to its foremost singer Teejan Bai, it might be {{as old as the}} Mahabharata itself, as few people could read in those times and <b>that</b> is how <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> passed on their stories generation after generation. Traditionally, Pandavani was performed exclusively by men. Since the 1980s, however, women also began to present Pandavani.|$|R
5000|$|Steven {{experiences}} {{a vision of}} himself floating among the shards of the Cluster. He realizes he can communicate with the shards, which are obsessed with trying to take form in order to feel whole. He tries to persuade them <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> all <b>they</b> need is each other's company. The shards begin conversing with each other, but cannot resist the impulse to take form. Steven encases a few shards in bubbles, and then wakes up in the drill to see the shards slowly begin to bubble each other. Steven eventually merges all the small bubbles into one huge bubble, encasing the Cluster.|$|R
60|$|I mused {{for some}} time upon what he had said, and found {{it was a very}} {{rational}} conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this it presently occurred to me, that in a little while the ship's crew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in their other boat to see for them; and <b>that</b> then <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> might come armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed was rational.|$|R
