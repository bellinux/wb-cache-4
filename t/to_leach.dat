5|$|Rockwell workers mixed {{hazardous}} {{and other}} wastes with concrete to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were {{stored in the}} open under tarps on asphalt pads. The pondcrete {{turned out to be}} weak storage, an outcome that had been predicted by Rockwell's own engineers. Relatively unprotected from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} iron {{occur in the}} iron sulfide mineral pyrite (FeS2), but it is {{difficult}} to extract iron from it and it is therefore not used. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it. During weathering, iron tends <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate. Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as iron(III) oxide.|$|E

25|$|The black-ash {{product of}} firing must be lixiviated right away to prevent {{oxidation}} of sulfides back to sulfate. In the lixiviation process, the black-ash is completely covered in water, again to prevent oxidation. To optimize the leaching of soluble material, the lixiviation {{is done in}} cascaded stages.

25|$|The {{presence}} of acid-forming materials exposed {{as a result}} of surface mining can affect wildlife by eliminating habitat and by causing direct destruction of some species.

25|$|The initial {{winemaking}} {{steps of}} Madeira start out {{like most other}} wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines – Bual and Malvasia – are often fermented on their skins <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> more phenols from the grapes to balance {{the sweetness of the}} wine. The more dry wines – made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole – are separated from their skins prior to fermentation. Depending on the level of sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral grape spirits.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer has {{inherited}} Wyeth's liabilities in the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site {{is highly}} toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land {{in order to}} clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses. The Sierra Club and the Edison Wetlands Association have come out {{in opposition to the}} cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants <b>to</b> <b>leach.</b> The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil off site could expose cleanup workers. The EPA's position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.|$|E
25|$|The late 20th century saw {{a wave of}} {{winemaking}} {{innovation and}} the popularization of several winemaking techniques. The mid-1980s saw increased usage of oak barrels for fermentation over stainless steel fermenting tanks. The process of stirring the lees (bâtonnage) also became more commonplace. By stirring the lees, the dead yeast come into greater contact with the wood-based tannins and pigments that are usually extracted into the wine. The lees act {{as a sort of}} buffer between the wines and the oak elements, allowing the wine to maintain its color and not become too harsh and tannic. In the late 1990s, more Muscadet producers started extending {{the amount of time that}} the must spends in contact with the grape skins prior to fermentation. This extended maceration allowed the wine <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> more phenolic compounds from the skin which can add complexity to the wine.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} natural and {{synthetic}} hinokitiol, {{as well as a}} water soluble derivative (hinokitiol sodium salt), to protect wood against fungal attack was examined. Synthetic and natural hinokitiol provided similar protection. All three materials exhibited similar antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Penicillium citrinum on yellow poplar wafers at concentrations of 1 mg/mL or greater. Fungal attack by Gloeophyllum trabeum or Trametes versicolor was completely inhibited in soil block tests in wood treated with any of the three extracts at concentrations of 20 mg/mL or greater. The water soluble hinokitiol sodium salt was highly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>leaching,</b> and blocks subjected <b>to</b> <b>leaching</b> had little resistance to fungal attack. The results suggest that further formulation development will be necessary to produce a water-soluble hinokitiol system that can resist leaching and retain biological activity...|$|R
25|$|Urea {{is usually}} spread at rates of between 40 and 300kg/ha but rates vary.

40|$|Although boron {{has many}} {{advantages}} as a wood preservative, this chemical performs poorly in leaching exposures. In this study, we investigated {{the potential for}} decreasing the leachability of boron preservatives with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Southern pine (Pinus spp.) test samples impregnated with combinations of sodium borate or boric acid and PEG were subjected <b>to</b> both <b>leaching</b> and decay tests. Samples treated sequentially with sodium borate or boric acid and then with PEG- 400 or PEG- 600 showed a significantly increased resistance <b>to</b> boron <b>leaching.</b> However, decay tests indicated that blocks treated with sodium borate or boric acid and PEG experienced slightly higher weight losses at nearly all retention levels, possibly {{as a result of}} PEG depletion. Thus, although the results suggest that bulking agents may enhance the resistance of boron <b>to</b> <b>leaching,</b> the enhanced leach resistance may be a temporary effect...|$|R
25|$|Most pottery {{produced}} in central Mexico is fired at low temperatures (low-fire) {{and covered with}} a glaze made with lead and other minerals. This is because lead will fuse and produce a shine at a firing temperature of less than 800C, while alternatives require temperatures twice as high. The use of lead in these wares has produced health warning in both Mexico and the United States, with the risks being known as early as the late 19th century. Lead from the glaze tends <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> into foods after repeated use. Use of this type of ware has been linked to elevated blood levels in children in Mexico City, Oaxaca and other places and severely high levels in children of potters. The lead content is highest in Oaxacan pottery. This lead content has blocked most rurally produced ceramics from the United States market, where they could fetch much higher prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{staple foods}} then used by other American Indian tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without {{irrigation}} in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see Mediterranean climate). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, {{and the environmental}} management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico. Indians thrived by catching and eating deer, Tule elk, small game, fish, mollusks, grass seed, berries, insects, edible plants and roots, {{making it possible to}} sustain a subsistence hunter-gatherer economy without any agriculture. Without agriculture or migratory herds of animals or fish there are no known ways to support villages, towns or cities—small tribes and extended family groups are the typical hunter-gatherer grouping. A dietary staple for most Indian tribes in interior California was acorns, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, roasted and soaked in water <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> out their tannin. The holes they ground into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.|$|E

500|$|Ireland has 12,000km² (4,633miles²) of bogland, {{consisting}} of two distinct types, blanket bogs and raised bogs. Blanket bogs are the more widespread of the two types. They are essentially a product of human activity aided by the moist Irish climate. Blanket bogs formed on sites where Neolithic farmers cleared trees for farming. As the land so cleared fell into disuse, the soil began <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> and become more acidic, producing a suitable environment {{for the growth of}} heather and rushes.

500|$|Supplements of {{potassium}} are {{most widely used}} in conjunction with diuretics that block reabsorption of sodium and water upstream from the distal tubule (thiazides and loop diuretics), because this promotes increased distal tubular potassium secretion, with resultant increased potassium excretion.

Typical doses range from 10mmol (400mg), to 20mmol (800mg).
