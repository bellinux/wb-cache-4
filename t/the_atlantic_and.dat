5|$|After her April 1916 commissioning, Tucker sailed in <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>and</b> the Caribbean.

In June, Tucker was transferred to Brest, France, and spent the remainder of the war there.|$|E

In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed.

5|$|By October 1938, {{the ship}} had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>and</b> Gulf coasts, {{and it is likely}} that Pan Gulf called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston during this time.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, {{restrictive}} practices {{on both sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>and</b> subsidised competition from American shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only. An example of the delaying effect of the strikes in the Canadian ports, with consequent impact on operating costs, was an extended ninety-day return voyage to Quebec City in early 1967 by the new Manchester Progress.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{composition}} of two deep-sea viral communities obtained from the Romanche Fracture Zone in <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean (collected at 5200 m depth) and the southwest Mediterranean Sea (from 2400 m depth) using a pyro-sequencing approach. The results are based on 18. 7 % and 6. 9 % of the sequences obtained from <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea, respectively, with hits to genomes in the non-redundant viral RefSeq database. The identifiable richness and relative abundance in both viromes were dominated by archaeal and bacterial viruses accounting for 92. 3 % of the relative abundance in <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean <b>and</b> for 83. 6 % in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite characteristic differences in hydrographic features between the sampling sites in <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea, 440 virus genomes were found in both viromes. An additional 431 virus genomes were identified in <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean <b>and</b> 75 virus genomes were only found in the Mediterranean Sea.
