The definitions of waters subject to CWA jurisdiction are contained in regulations of the Corps of Engineers and EPA, the agencies with primary responsibility for administering section 404.

Furthermore, the table of <b>the</b> existing waste <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> and industrial waste <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> in Slovenia is included, because the locations of already existent waste <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> have to be considered when spatially planning <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> infrastructure in <b>the</b> environment.

5000|$|Operation CHASE (an {{acronym for}} [...] "Cut Holes And Sink 'Em") was a United States Department of Defense {{program for the}} {{disposal}} of unwanted munitions at sea from May 1964 until the early 1970s.

Surface soil samples (n= 12 + 12) were collected from both the open waste dumping areas allocated by Capital Development Authority (CDA) and sub- sectors of H-belt of Islamabad city (representative of control site).
