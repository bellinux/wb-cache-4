5|$|In August 2016, RBS {{cancelled}} {{its plan}} <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> Williams & Glyn {{as a separate}} business, stating that the new bank could not survive independently. It revealed it would instead seek to sell the division to another bank. In February 2017, HM Treasury and the European Commission reached a provisional agreement in which RBS {{would be able to}} retain the Williams & Glyn assets in return for investing £750 million into a fund aimed at increasing SME lending by challenger banks and for RBS agreeing to allow SME customers of challenger banks to use its branch network for cash and cheque handling. The European Commission confirmed in April 2017 that it would scrutinise the proposal.|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of Smith and Brinker, Pillsbury allowed many of their changes to be relaxed, as well as scaled back on construction of new locations which {{had the effect of}} stalling corporate growth. By failing to follow through on the changes of the two men, Pillsbury caused its own value to diminish as it derived more than one third of its sales and two thirds of its profits from the burger chain. When the British alcoholic beverages company Grand Metropolitan PLC made a hostile bid for Pillsbury, the company devised a plan <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> the financially flailing restaurant unit in hopes to raise an estimated US$2billion {{that could be used to}} fend off the unwanted suitor. The complex potentially tax-free stock split plan would have led to the chain, along with its distribution system Distron, becoming a separate entity for the first time in over twenty years.|$|E

25|$|After privatization, the Shinkansen network {{continues}} to see significant expansion to less populated areas, but {{with far more}} flexibility <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days.

25|$|The circuit is not, however, {{without its}} critics. After qualifying, Jenson Button {{claimed that the}} track was getting bumpier as the weekend went on, {{particularly}} at Turn 8, which was what caused so many drivers <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off.</b> This harks back to another circuit designed by Hermann Tilke, Shanghai International Circuit, which {{is said to be}} sinking in places because it was built on the site of a former swamp. Jarno Trulli was notable for his lukewarm feeling towards the circuit, saying that he felt the circuit was easy to learn, and that good performance was down more to the car than the driver.|$|E
25|$|As the {{manufacturing}} branch expanded, its production ability increased beyond {{the demand for}} phones, and it faced closure for several months a year without manufacturing other products. This was a problem because the Bell Telephone Company of Canada's (later renamed to Bell Canada) charter would {{not allow them to}} build other products. So in 1895, the Bell Telephone of Canada was required <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> its manufacturing arm to build phones for sale to other companies, as well as other devices such as fire alarm boxes, police street call boxes, and fire department call equipment. This company was incorporated as the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited.|$|E

25|$|Under {{pressure}} from major investors Peter May and Nelson Peltz, in late 2005, Wendy's {{announced it would}} sell between 15% and 18% of the Tim Hortons operations in an initial public offering, which was completed on March 24, 2006, and subsequently said it would spin off to shareholders its remaining interest {{by the end of}} 2006. Wendy's cited increased competition between the two chains and Tim Hortons' increasing self-sufficiency as reasons for its decision, but the company had been under shareholder pressure to make such a move because of the strength and profitability of the Tim Hortons brand. Peltz in 2008 acquired Wendy's after pressuring them initially <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> Tim Hortons.|$|E
25|$|The company {{currently}} owns all the land, {{valued at}} an estimated $16 to $18 billion, on which its restaurants are situated. The company earns {{a significant portion of}} its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010 and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue {{at the end of the}} period. In recent times, there have been calls <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> the company's US holdings into a potential real estate investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too large a risk to the company's business model.|$|E
25|$|By mid 2007 the {{relaunch}} and {{redesign of}} HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, {{and the business}} started to turn around. In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO. The IPO launched in August 2008. A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.|$|E

In March, the company declared its tender offer for Swiss biotechnology company Actelion successful on Friday, reporting that Janssen Holding GmbH controlled 77.2 percent of the voting rights after the main offer period, equating to 83,195,346 Actelion shares. In keeping with earlier agreements, the company announced its intention to delist Actelion, whilst spinning out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd.

25|$|In 1970, the FCC forced Triangle to {{sell off}} its {{broadcasting}} properties due to protests from then-Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Shapp complained that Triangle had used its three Pennsylvania television stations—WFIL-TV, WLYH-TV in Lebanon and WFBG-TV (now WTAJ-TV) in Altoona—in a smear campaign against him. The WFIL stations, along with radio-television combinations in New Haven, Connecticut and Fresno, California, were sold to Capital Cities Communications. As a condition of the sale, Capital Cities had <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> the radio stations to other entities – in Philadelphia, WFIL-FM (now WIOQ) was sold to its general manager John Richer, and WFIL radio went to LIN Broadcasting. On April 27, 1971, shortly after the sale was approved and Capital Cities took control of channel 6, the station changed its call letters to the current WPVI-TV.|$|E
25|$|After {{making a}} {{television}} production: La Matiouette ou l'arrière-pays, (1983), Téchiné returned to critical attention with Rendez-vous (1985), a sexy noir melodrama replete with the seductive {{surface of the}} era. In the film a would-be actress, Nina, fleeing her provincial home for Paris, enters a turbulent love relationship with a sadistic, self-destructive young actor, who caused {{the death of his}} former girlfriend. When the actor himself is killed in an accident, or possible suicide, his former mentor/director, and father of the dead girlfriend, determines to cast the inexperienced Nina as the female lead in 'Romeo and Juliet', a role his deceased daughter played. The film is ultimately a vehicle for exploring the violent intensity of certain emotional attachments and their ability to cause one's life <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> in unexpected directions. By now a key director of the post-New Wave, this film earned Téchiné the Cannes Festival Best Direction Award while helping launch the career of Juliette Binoche.|$|E
