25|$|Many Ainur descended, taking {{physical}} form and becoming bound to that world. The greater Ainur {{became known as}} the Valar, while the lesser Ainur were called the Maiar. The Valar attempted to prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and Men), while Melkor, who wanted Arda for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> thousands of years until, through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} myth surrounding {{the origins of}} Somananda. He claimed he was a descendent of the sage Durvasa. Durvasa received from Shiva the spiritual mission of keeping the tradition and secrets of Agamic Shaivism alive. It is said that Durvasa created his son, Tryambaka, directly from the mind (in a similar way {{with the creation of}} Athena directly from the mind of her father, Zeus, in the Greek mythology). In turn, Tryambaka also created a son directly from his mind. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 15 generation terminating with the father of Sangamaditya, who took a woman as a wife. Then, there were three more generations until Somananda. So, Somananda claims a divine spiritual ancestry and investiture.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E
5000|$|He {{also appears}} in the opening scene of George Gershwin's opera, Porgy and Bess, with the {{spelling}} 'Jasbo Brown'. He takes no part in the plot, but plays [...] "a low-down blues" [...] on the piano while couples dance. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> several minutes, expanding as the chorus and orchestra join in, before transitioning into the song [...] "Summertime".|$|R
6000|$|With {{the second}} glass of champagne, {{a kind of}} hum makes itself heard, which, when {{divested}} of casual accessories and resolved into its primal element, {{is found to be}} James telling a story, and <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a long time, encroaching sometimes even upon what must universally be recognised as the crowning point of a Forsyte feast--'the saddle of mutton.' ...|$|R

500|$|The Cenacle was run {{under the}} {{supervision}} of [...] Dom C. Shiarella, the treasurer of the First National Bank in New Kensington and the cashier of the Building Fund Campaign. He was in charge of collecting all of the pledges made [...] toward the Building Fund. This work kept him in the bank for one or two hours longer than the other employees every evening. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> almost five years. [...] Mr. Shiarella was also in charge of making sure there was enough money in the church's bank account for the payroll that was taken out every other Friday. The needed funds were always collected in time and there was never a week when the account bounced.|$|E
500|$|Since {{finding the}} right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time, the show had already begun taping around the {{character}} for two weeks. Nader spent his first weeks on All My Children working overtime to catch up. [...] "By the time we had resolved some of the terms," [...] he said, [...] "they were really against the wall in terms of back story.... In retrospect, I should have just slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day!" [...] Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene's main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, [...] "They had devised this sort of 'tapestry' layered look for Dimitri {{and it was like}} doing scenes inside a sauna." [...] This was eventually rectified, but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks.|$|E
2500|$|... {{disconnected}} {{power to}} the microphone. Then in a nonviolent resistance act of public social rejection, reminiscent of {{the scene in the}} film Casablanca, the congregation sang [...] "", [...] "", and other songs. A woman in her 80's who had spent 10 years in a Communist prison reflected that, even the Communists were afraid to close churches. A furious, intense clapping broke out as the bishop stood frozen. Louder and louder it grew, with accusations of 'Traitor' and 'Judas' chanted at Lennon. Those in the pews burst into religious and patriotic hymns, 'Boze Cos Polske' and 'Serdeczna Matko.' <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> approximately 15 minutes. At the end of the Mass, the bishop stood {{at the back of the}} church with the undercover police trying to compose himself and greet people. Many of the faithful would have no part of him.}} ...|$|E

2500|$|Now I {{will never}} forget this incident... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other {{frontier}} base and word came through about 6 {{o'clock in the morning}} that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [...] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [...] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village {{to the scene of the}} mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I {{will never forget}} arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and <b>this</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> about 20minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground... Monty had him [...] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said [...] "Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't." [...] Monty said [...] "All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future." ...|$|E

5000|$|The poem was {{originally}} sent to Hagar Olsson in an April 1920 letter where Edith recounts flu, abject poverty, and a humiliating attempt {{to sell some}} old underwear to get money.

He saw himself making noble provision for his only daughter.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> {{four or five}} days.

50|$|Betrayed {{a second}} time, Millie becomes very bitter. With her female cohorts, Helen and Angie (Lilyan Tashman and Joan Blondell, respectively), she becomes {{a woman who}} loves a good time, {{floating}} from man to man. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> several years, until she hears that Damier has taken an interest in her teen-age daughter, Connie, who bears {{a striking resemblance to}} her. Millie warns Damier to leave her daughter alone, but, although he promises to stay away from Connie, he ignores Millie's warning and takes Connie to a remote lodge to seduce her. Millie is tipped off, goes to the lodge with a gun, confronts Jimmy and kills him.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Hartmuot and his warriors return home. There Kudrun and her {{ladies in}} waiting are {{introduced}} into the royal household. But because Kudrun declares she can never love Hartmuot and will always regard herself as a captive, she and her attendants are forced by Hartmuot’s mother, Queen Gerlint, {{into the role of}} castle servants in an effort to break Kudrun’s will. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> eight years, but Kudrun remains firm. So Hartmuot asks his sister to take over and try kindness instead. The result is the same: Kudrun never stops refusing to become Hartmuot’s queen. So Gerlint takes over again and Kudrun is forced to become the castle washerwoman.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> five glorious years, {{the only}} {{years of my}} life I'd ever lived, and then came, as I thought, the end of everything.

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a few days, and {{although}} the subject was not mooted, Mrs. Sankey felt that unless some concession on her part was made it was likely that the match would fall through. This she had not the slightest idea of permitting, and rather than it should happen she would have married without any settlement at all, for she really loved, in her weak way, {{the man who had}} been so attentive and deferential to her.|$|E
60|$|Again Godfrey dreamed, {{a strange}} and {{beautiful}} dream which went on from day to day. It {{was that he was}} very ill and that Isobel had come to nurse him. She came quite suddenly and at first seemed a little frightened and disturbed, but afterwards very happy indeed. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a while, till suddenly there struck him a sense of something terrible that had happened, of an upheaval of conditions, of a wrenching asunder of ties, of change utter and profound.|$|E
5000|$|Both Crun and Minnie {{would often}} welcome others {{with the word}} [...] "Morrrrrning!", {{repeated}} again and again. Another of Crun's catchphrases was [...] "You can't get the wood, you know ..." [...] Minnie's catchphrase is [...] "we'll all be murdered in our beds," [...] and often refers to other characters as 'buddy'. They have many ways of taking {{a long time to}} answer the door, such as a humorous sketch when FX make it sound as if Minnie is walking down several long flights of stairs. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> about a minute, until Henry says [...] "I can't understand it, we live in a bungalow!" ...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the movie}} reveals that an Israeli soldier, Youssef (Maher Bsaibes), {{stationed}} at the border {{is in love with}} Lamia. After Lamia comes to live in Samy’s house, she barely eats or sleeps or talks; <b>this</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 20 days. Later, during an argument with her husband, Lamia tells him that she loves someone else, who turns out to be Youssef. Samy’s family gets frustrated with Lamia and takes her to the border so that she can talk to her mother. Lamia is given binoculars, but instead of looking at her mother, she turns to look at Youssef and exchanges smiles with him. Both families fume at this and her binoculars are taken away.|$|R
60|$|The next tidings that {{happened}} at Froda {{were that the}} shepherd came in and was very silent; he spoke little, and that in a frenzied manner. Folk were most inclined {{to believe that he}} had been bewitched, because he went about by himself, and talked to himself. <b>This</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some time, but one evening, when two weeks of winter had passed, the shepherd came home, went to his bed, and lay down there.

Still Zikali sat silent and I, who was acquainted with the habits of this people, knew that I was witnessing a conflict between two they considered to be respectively a spiritual and an earthly king. It is my belief that unless he were first addressed, Zikali would have sat all night without opening his lips. Possibly Cetewayo {{would have done the}} same if the impatience of public opinion had allowed him. At any was rate it was he who gave way.|$|E
50|$|On the show, celebrity {{teams of}} five were sent into two {{separate}} rooms. In each round of play, {{a set of}} five movie titles to be guessed are predetermined by the producers. One person from each team is given the first title; then each must run to {{a section of the}} house where his/her teammates are waiting, then pantomime the title. The team member who guesses correctly subsequently runs to the central location where someone is waiting with the second answer to be guessed. <b>This</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> five answers. When all answers are guessed, the team must come up with the common theme that chains the answers together. The first team to do so wins the round.|$|R
