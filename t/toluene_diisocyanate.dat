40|$|An {{improved}} {{method was}} developed and validated for measuring low-level concentrations of <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanates</b> (TDls) in air. The method is based on OSHA Method 42 for industrial applications. Airborne TDls were trapped on a 25 -mm glass-fiber filter impregnated with 50 pg of 1 -(2 -pyridy 1) piperazine. A filter holder was constructed to minimize contamination and losses of the analytes. The derivatized TDls were extracted by immersion of the filter in a small volume of solvent. The analysis was performed with a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a fluorescence detector and a CIB base-deactivated silica column. The modified method has a lower limit of quantitation of 0. 02 ppb in 15 L of air for both 2, 4 -toluene diisocyanate (2, 4 -TDI) and 2, 6 -toluene diisocyanate (2, 6 -TDI), {{which is about a}} fifteen-fold enhancement over Method 42. The recovery efficiencies and 95 % confidence intervals for vapor-spiked filters were 77 {+-} 6 percent for 2, 4 -TDI and 69 {+-} 10 percent for 2, 6 -TDI. The precision of replicate analyses was ten percent or better. The method was used to screen flexible polyurethane foam for emissions of unreacted TDls...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of specific phase-separated morphologies {{is central to}} achieving high performance polyurethanes. Polyurethanes are composed of various structural elements possessing a mixture of different functional groups, molecular weights, and sequence lengths. The chemistry, the phase behavior, and the kinetics of phase evolution will influence the type of phase-separated morphology formed. In fact, the phase behavior also depends upon the chemical structure and the molecular weight distribution of the components. Despite the importance of chemical structure, {{it is still not}} understood quantitatively. In addition, little is known about how the developing structure organizes into different phase-separated morphologies. ^ The work herein addresses these issues. The molecular weight distributions, end groups, and linkages of polyurethane structural elements were quantitatively determined. The structural elements included polyether and polyester macrodiols, polyurethane prepolymers, and polyurea hard segments. Under homogeneous conditions, the molecular weight distribution formed obeys a Schultz-Flory distribution; although when <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanates</b> are used as the diisocyanate the effect of change in reactivity narrows the distribution. Under heterogeneous conditions, the phase separation of water causes a change in the local stoichiometry and narrows the distribution further. In the presence of typical polyurethane side reactions, the distribution is broadened. The {{formation of}} allophanate linkages was most prevalent in PPG prepolymers prepared at reaction temperatures of 145 °C. ^ Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the crystallization behavior of semicrystalline polyurethanes and the reaction and morphological evolution of polyurethane foams. Hydrogen bonding between urethane groups was shown to influence all aspects of the crystallization behavior, including the initial state, nucleation and growth rates, and the final morphology. Hydrogen bonding proves to be less crucial in the onset of phase separation in polyurethane foams. The most crucial parameter was shown to be hard segment anisotropy. Foams prepared from diisocyanates yielding highly anisotropic hard segments phase separate at lower reaction conversion, with a faster rate, and to a higher degree of phase separation and perfection. ...|$|R

The 13 C-NMR spectrum revealed a peak at 20 ppm, that {{can be attributed to the}} CH 3 of the polyether chain, and two small peaks at 117 and 140 ppm, attributed to the aromatic ring. The X-ray diffractograms also indicated that after the grafting reaction, the samples of amylopectin-rich starch are more amorphous. Moreover, the glass transition temperature (Tg) dropped from 50 °C to - 11 °C. These results indicate formation of grafted products and the low Tg of the samples suggests that polyether-grafted starch is a good candidate to obtain solid polymeric electrolytes...|$|R

50|$|The {{aromatic}} polyurethane and urea type crosslinker {{is one of}} {{the significant}} reasons why many cathodic electrocoats show high levels of protection against corrosion. Of course {{it is not the only}} reason, but if one compares electrocoating compositions with aromatic urethane crosslinkers to analogous systems containing aliphatic urethane crosslinkers, consistently systems with aromatic urethane crosslinkers perform significantly better. However, coatings containing aromatic urethane crosslinkers generally do not perform well in terms of UV light resistance. If the resulting coating contains aromatic urea crosslinks, the UV resistance will be considerably worse than if only urethane crosslinks can occur. A disadvantage of aromatic urethanes is that they can also cause yellowing of the coating itself as well as cause yellowing in subsequent topcoat layers. A significant undesired side reaction which occurs during the baking process produces aromatic polyamines. Urethane crosslinkers based on <b>toluene</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (TDI) can be expected to produce toluene diamine as a side reaction, whereas those based on Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate produce diaminodiphenylmethane and higher order aromatic polyamines. The undesired aromatic polyamines can inhibit the cure of subsequent acid catalysed topcoat layers, and can cause delamination of the subsequent topcoat layers after exposure to sunlight. Although the industry has never acknowledged this problem, many of these undesired aromatic polyamines are known or suspected carcinogens.|$|E
