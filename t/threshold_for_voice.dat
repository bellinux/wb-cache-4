40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The analysis, parameterization and modeling of voice source estimates obtained via inverse filtering of recorded speech {{are some of the}} most challenging areas of speech processing owing to the fact humans produce a wide range of voice source realizations and that the voice source estimates commonly contain artifacts due to the non-linear time-varying source-filter coupling. Currently, the most widely adopted representation of voice source signal is Liljencrants-Fant's (LF) model which was developed in late 1985. Due to the overly simplistic interpretation of voice source dynamics, LF model can not represent the fine temporal structure of glottal flow derivative realizations nor can it carry the sufficient spectral richness to facilitate a truly natural sounding speech synthesis. In this thesis we have introduced Characteristic Glottal Pulse Waveform Parameterization and Modeling (CGPWPM) which constitutes an entirely novel framework <b>for</b> <b>voice</b> source analysis, parameterization and reconstruction. In comparative evaluation of CGPWPM and LF model we have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to preserve higher levels of speaker dependant information from the voice source estimates and realize a more natural sounding speech synthesis. In general, we have shown that CGPWPM-based speech synthesis rates highly on the scale of absolute perceptual acceptability and that speech signals are faithfully reconstructed on consistent basis, across speakers, gender. We have applied CGPWPM to voice quality profiling and text-independent voice quality conversion method. The proposed voice conversion method is able to achieve the desired perceptual effects and the modified speech remained as natural sounding and intelligible as natural speech. In this thesis, we have also developed an optimal wavelet <b>thresholding</b> strategy <b>for</b> <b>voice</b> source signals which is able to suppress aspiration noise and still retain both the slow and the rapid variations in the voice source estimate...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} generic traffic models {{which can}} be used <b>for</b> integrated <b>voice</b> and data traffic for networks with various characteristics. The main focus is on the impact of buffering voice and data packets having various traffic loads and analyzing the effects of mobility issues on system performance. Analytical models for single and multi-channel systems are developed and their solution techniques for finite and infinite queuing capacities are presented. For single server systems a new product form solution approach is only provided for the static stations. For more complex systems, when multi-server systems and mobile stations are considered, it may not be possible to find a product form solution because the increased number of transitions makes the solution intractable. Therefore, Kolmogorov equations are used effectively to find the solutions for the finite queuing capacities. On the other hand, Spectral Expansion is used for systems with in- finite queuing capacities. The results obtained are validated using a discrete-event simulation (DES) tool. In integrated voice and data wireless networks, the most important consideration is to utilize the resources in an efficient way and maintain the required quality of service (QoS). Because of the increasing demand in using wireless networks for multiple services, efficient Buffer Management (BM) analysis, Call Admission Control (CAC) techniques and also threshold analysis in order to find the minimum and maximum values for the system resources (i. e. buffer and channel capacities) are required for integrating different services such as voice and data in order to provide the expected QoS to users. Unlike traditional networks, it is possible {{to take advantage of a}} single network for multiple services in the current wireless networks (WLAN, EDGE, 3 G, HSDPA, HSPA, LTE). The integration of services prevents the need for many overlaying networks, which makes network management difficult. Service requirements are different <b>for</b> <b>voice</b> and data traffic. While voice packets are delay-sensitive, data packets cannot tolerate blocking (i. e. being dropped). In order to provide high QoS at all times, it is important to consider the trade-off between voice and data traffic. Current wireless network systems are indeed getting faster and faster. Therefore, it may be possible to queue voice calls. In addition, channel reservation is widely accepted as the only way to provide acceptable QoS for Wide Area Networks (WANs) as different characteristics of services are integrated. In this thesis, firstly, we developed a performance model of a cell for WLAN and cellular network systems where the impact of buffering voice packet is considered <b>for</b> integrated <b>voice</b> and data services. Following this, service and buffer management analysis is carried out to minimize the cost of data packets over voice packets and therefore prevent data packets to be lost. Furthermore, the effect of handoff arrival is included. Algorithms to determine the buffer <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> <b>voice</b> packets and the overall capacity are developed. Traffic constraints and mobility issues are integrated and a generic traffic model is proposed. The proposed generic model can be applied to all networks using different policies and algorithms. The results obtained from this study clearly show that it is possible to queue voice packets with a small portion of buffering. This reduces the blocking probability and hence allows for better operation of both traffic services. Moreover, apart from the prioritization of traffic classes, it is also important to optimize the buffering scheme for the overall system performance. Furthermore, this work points out that channel reservation, which is commonly used, is not the only way to provide acceptable QoS for integrated service networks. Different analytical solution techniques are used in order to obtain results which are validated using discrete-event simulation techniques. This study sheds a light to better understand the trade-off between different types of services to provide high QoS for wireless networks. Hence, the proposed models in this study can be considered as part of a generic model in the design and development of future wireless systems and therefore can be modified to support not only voice and data services but also video applications over several networks...|$|R

2500|$|One {{disadvantage}} of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard AM) {{is that the}} receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received signal-to-noise ratio, say, {{by a factor of}} 10 (a 10 decibel improvement), thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to [...] frequency modulation (FM) and digital radio where the effect of such noise following demodulation is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> reception.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess if core {{temperature}} <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> exercise ventilation differ between sites of core temperature measurement during an incremental exercise test from rest to the point of exhaustion. It was hypothesized that the core temperature <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (VE/VO 2),measured with ingestible pill temperature, would not be different from the oesophageal temperature and tympanic membrane temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2. METHODS: Four females volunteered for this study that was approved by the SFU Office of Research Ethics. Two of the female volunteers were amenorrheic and the other two were in follicular phase of their menstrual cycles. The results were then compared to four males VE/VO 2 oesophageal (TOES) and tympanic membrane (TTY) temperature thresholds from a published study. Each volunteer after a 24 h reflection period, signed a medical history form, a PAR-Q, as well as gave their signed informed consent. Core temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> exercise ventilation were assessed with an ingestible pill temperature (TPILL) sensor, with a TOES probe and with TTY probe. Minute ventilation (VE) and volume of consumed oxygen (VO 2) were quantified by indirect calorimetry. Vieth threshold software was employed to determine the core temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2. An unpaired, two-tailed t-test was used to compare the core temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> exercise ventilation. The P value was set at 0. 05. RESULTS: The TPILL <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2 of 37. 1 ± 0. 4 °C(mean±SD) showed a trend (p= 0. 06) to be lower than the TES <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2 of 37. 5 ± 0. 2 °C. No difference was evident between TPILL threshold and TTY threshold of 37. 03 ± 0. 2 °C for VE/VO 2.
