40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the attitudes of restaurant managers, employees and customers towards a <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban</b> policy in restau-rants. A restaurant based survey in an urban area of Kunming City, China, was carried out from May to August 2009. One hundred managers, 1, 055 employees and 5, 213 customers aged 15 years or above were interviewed using a structured ques-tionnaire. The percentage of respondents supporting a <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban</b> in restau-rants was 17 % among managers, 13. 4 % among employees, and 16. 6 % among cus-tomers. Multilevel analysis confirmed respondents who did not smoke, who were educated, and who worked or dined at a restaurant with fewer than 200 seats were more likely to support a <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban.</b> A <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban</b> in restaurants is unlikely to be supported by people involved in the restaurant business in the study area. This coincides with poor awareness of the harms of smoking. Key words: smoking ban, restaurant, attitude, Chin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{introduction}} of <b>total</b> smoking <b>bans</b> represents {{an important step}} in addressing the smoking and physical health of people with mental illness. Despite evidence indicating the importance of staff support in the successful implementation of smoking bans, limited research has examined levels of staff support prior to the implementation of a ban in psychiatric settings, or factors that are associated with such support. This study aimed to examine the views of psychiatric inpatient hospital staff regarding the perceived benefits of and barriers to implementation of a successful <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban</b> in mental health services. Secondly, to examine the level of support among clinical and non-clinical staff for a <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban.</b> Thirdly, to examine the association between the benefits and barriers perceived by clinicians and their support for a <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban</b> in their unit. Methods Cross-sectional survey of both clinical and non-clinical staff in a large inpatient psychiatric hospital immediately prior to the implementation of a <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban.</b> Results Of the 300 staff, 183 (61 %) responded. Seventy-three (41 %) of total respondents were clinical staff, and 110 (92 %) were non-clinical staff. More than two-thirds of staff agreed that a smoking ban would improve their work environment and conditions, help staff to stop smoking and improve patients' physical health. The most prevalent clinician perceived barriers to a successful <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban</b> related to fear of patient aggression (89 %) and patient non-compliance (72 %). Two thirds (67 %) of all staff indicated support for a <b>total</b> smoking <b>ban</b> in mental health facilities generally, and a majority (54 %) of clinical staff expressed support for a ban within their unit. Clinical staff who believed a smoking ban would help patients to stop smoking were more likely to support a smoking ban in their unit. Conclusions There is a clear need to more effectively communicate to staff the evidence that consistently applied smoking bans do not increase patient aggression. There is also a need to communicate the benefits of smoking bans in aiding the delivery of smoking cessation care, and the benefits of both smoking bans and such care in aiding patients to stop smoking. </p...|$|R
