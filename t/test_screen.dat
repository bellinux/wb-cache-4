500|$|DreamWorks {{contracted}} Amazon.com {{to create}} the official website, marking {{the first time that}} Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film. The website included an overview, a photo gallery, cast and crew filmographies, and exclusive interviews with Spacey and Bening. The film's tagline—"look closer"—originally came from a cutting pasted on Lester's workplace cubicle by the set dresser. DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers—one aimed at adults, the other at teenagers. Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose. Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films, David Hochman of Entertainment Weekly rated American Beautys highly, saying it evoked the tagline; he said, [...] "You return to the poster again and again, thinking, this time you're gonna find something." [...] DreamWorks did not want to <b>test</b> <b>screen</b> the film; according to Mendes, the studio was pleased with it, but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward. The studio reluctantly agreed and showed the film to a young audience in San Jose, California. Mendes claimed the screening went very well.|$|E

For the American {{theatrical}} release, the studio hired the National Research Group to <b>test</b> <b>screen</b> the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13million and US$15million in its opening weekend. Fight Club opened commercially in the United States and Canada on October15, 1999 and earned US$11,035,485 in 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend. The film ranked {{first at the}} weekend box office, defeating Double Jeopardy and The Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener. The gender mix of audiences for Fight Club, argued to be [...] "the ultimate anti-date flick", was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's expectations. Over the second weekend, Fight Club dropped 42.6% in revenue, earning US$6,335,870. Against its production budget of , the film grossed [...] from its theatrical run in the United States and Canada and earned [...] in theaters worldwide. The underwhelming North American performance of Fight Club soured the relationship between 20th Century Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000.|$|E

50|$|TELON is an {{application}} code generator that uses macros to generate COBOL, COBOL/II, or PL/I code that can run natively {{in the target}} environment without run-time proprietary code. Developers create screen designs in the TELON Design Facility (TDF) and define attributes for the screen. The design can then be run through a prototyper to <b>test</b> <b>screen</b> flow. Next, macros generate the code using the information created by the TDF. Lastly, the TELON Test Facility is used, in conjunction with code debuggers, to search for and fix bugs before the application is moved into production.|$|E
50|$|Christensen and McNeil {{spent the}} {{following}} few years {{working on the}} next claims processing application. McNeil designed the template COBOL programs and Christensen coded the macros to generate the actual COBOL programs. They created a system that could generate COBOL code from screen layouts created by users. The COBOL ran in IBM's TSO interactive environment and it allowed the users and engineers to <b>test</b> <b>screen</b> flow. When a user wanted a change, the layout was altered using a design tool and new COBOL was generated. This {{turned out to be}} a very successful way to prototype the new system. Liberty Mutual put out a bid to create the new system which the Digital Equipment Corporation won in 1979. Christensen then left IBM to work as a private consultant for Liberty Mutual. When Liberty Mutual moved their offices to New Hampshire in that year, McNeil left the company to study classical guitar on Cape Cod.|$|E

30|$|As noted, {{with the}} {{development}} of technology-based assessments, test developers face new challenges, which we considered carefully. After the item construction and technology-based implementation, 2 a comprehensive technology check was conducted. Sophisticated technologies (e.g., Javascript and multimedia elements) were excluded from our assessment to provide an optimal assessment condition. Moreover, because of different <b>test</b> <b>screen</b> sizes, the assessment screen was fixed. In our technology check, for example, the newly developed assessment was conducted using several browsers and different versions to exclude browser-specific differences in the layout. In a pilot study, a drop-out analysis was conducted to reveal any technical difficulties. Finally, in the pilot study, the automatically recorded assessment time of each participant was considered as an additional indicator of the function of the technology-based assessment. After the development of the technology-based assessment, a technology check was conducted by an online test to ensure an error-free assessment. This online pre-test revealed technology-based problems. Moreover, the pre-test checked, for example, whether sound was available and whether the Internet capacity was suitable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Glycolytic {{isozymes}} {{that are}} restricted to the male germline are potential targets {{for the development of}} reversible, non-hormonal male contraceptives. GAPDHS, the sperm-specific isoform of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, is an essential enzyme for glycolysis making it an attractive target for rational drug design. Toward this goal, we have optimized and validated a high-throughput spectrophotometric assay for GAPDHS in 384 -well format. The assay was stable over time and tolerant to DMSO. Whole plate validation experiments yielded Z ’ values> 0. 8 indicating a robust assay for HTS. Two compounds were identified and confirmed from a <b>test</b> <b>screen</b> of the Prestwick collection. This assay was used to screen a diverse chemical library and identified fourteen small molecules that modulated the activity of recombinant purified GAPDHS with confirmed IC 50 values ranging from 1. 8 to 42 �M. These compounds may provide useful scaffolds as molecular tools to probe the role of GAPDHS in sperm motility and long term to develop potent and selective GAPDHS inhibitors leading to novel contraceptive agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} less empirical way of selecting an appropriate polymeric stabilising agent that would effectively maintain good dispersibility of a given drug substance with known physico-chemical properties. This was achieved by quantifying the adsorption of different polymers onto a range of drug substances from different solvent environments and to establish which physico-chemical properties of the polymers control their adsorption or non-adsorption onto a particular drug. The pharmaceutical actives, two proprietary compounds SB- 223412, SB- 204269 and loperamide HCl were investigated. The drugs are particulate, with very poor water solubility. The drug particles were examined using SEM. The mean particle size was 1. 1, 1. 4 and 1. 0 µm respectively. The polymeric excipients chosen for this investigation were the water-soluble polymers hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), gum arabic (GA), guar gum (GG) and lambda-carrageenan (l-carrageenan). The physico-chemical methods developed in this work help improve the current empirical selection of an appropriate polymer in pre-formulation studies. The methods include an initial bottle <b>test</b> <b>screen.</b> The aim of the screen was to establish which polymers were the most effective in producing stable dispersions of the chosen drug substances. The bottle <b>test</b> <b>screen</b> results showed l-carrageenan and HPMC to be effective stabilisers on SB- 223412 and loperamide HCl particles respectively. GA, HPMC and 0. 15 M NaCl l-carrageenan caused partial dispersion on SB- 223412, SB- 204269 and loperamide HCl respectively. Stable dispersions were monitored by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) for changes in particle size after their preparation and also for up to three months thereafter. Samples remained dispersed at three months. The adsorption characteristics of the stabilising and partially stabilising polymers were quantified by the construction of adsorption isotherms under various conditions of pH and ionic strength. All isotherms were low affinity with a pronounced shoulder region followed by a plateau. Generally all stabilising polymers adsorb to approximately the same amount. Clear differences were seen in the amount adsorbed of partial dispersions. The isotherms provided information regarding how much polymer was required to saturate the surface of a given mass of drug and also some insight into the stabilising mechanism. The combined techniques provided very useful qualitative and quantitative information about the physico-chemical, intermolecular and structural properties of pharmaceutical dispersions in a pre-formulation stage.

40|$|Abstract Automated GUI tests {{typically}} {{comprise of}} several test steps that are executed on the GUI before reaching {{a point of}} assertion. Comparing a longer and complex exe-cution of a GUI test to its test instructions for debugging is a laborious task: re-establish the test environment, slow down test execution for human perception, and locate the currently executed test step. Video documentation of GUI tests for debugging purposes is already present in several industry tools. However, it is not optimized for effective documentation of on-screen actions nor synched with the executed test instructions. We present a video-based documentation of automated GUI tests that links the executed test case instruction to the on-screen response of the application under <b>test.</b> <b>Screen</b> recording is optimized for speed and memory consumption while all relevant details are captured. Additional browsing capabilities for easier debugging are introduced. Concepts of aspect-oriented programming are adapted for tracing of pre-compiled test case scripts. Our concepts are evaluated by a working implementation, a series of performance measurements during a technical experiment, and industrial experience from 370 real-world test cases carried out in a large software company. The limits of our implementation regarding video capturing and code tracing are explored with a specialized test frame...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{frequency}} of and attitudes toward Papanicolaou (Pap) <b>test</b> <b>screening</b> in women who have sex with women (WSW) and to determine prevalence of genital human papillomavirus (HPV). METHODS: Women were eligible if they reported having engaged in sex with another woman in the preceding year Medical and sexual histories were obtained. Cervical specimens for Pap tests and cervical and vaginal specimens for HPV DNA testing were collected. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 31 of 248 WSW (13 %). Women who had never had sex with men were less likely to have undergone pelvic examinations and had fewer recent Pap tests. Reasons for not undergoing Pap tests included lack of insurance, previous adverse experiences, and belief that Pap tests were unnecessary. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the occurrence of genital HPV, WSW do not receive adequate Pap <b>test</b> <b>screening.</b> Pap <b>test</b> <b>screening</b> recommendations should not differ for WSW, regardless of sexual history with men...|$|R
