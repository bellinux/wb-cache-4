40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a formula for {{estimating}} the concentration time in a river basin, the-oretically and practically. The concentration time {{is defined as the}} time required for disturbanceof rainwater to propagate from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> located at the remotest portion of the basin in thesense of dynamics to the outlet. Based on this definition, the equation for the concentration timeis derived from the kinematic wave theory to emphasize being a function of the average effectiverainfall intensity or peak discharge and of the area of watershed. By applying an approximatemethod to estimate the concentration time, the hydrological data in 18 natural river basins of 0. 13 - 740 km 2 are examined to propose a practical formula for the concentration time. Theformula is also modified to extend its applicability to grazing and urban watersheds...|$|E

40|$|Grapevine is a {{perennial}} crop whose growth and productivity {{can be affected}} by many pedoclimatic and agrotechnological factors. Currently, land terracing is a common field organization for new vineyard plantations, reducing slope on the cultivated land, and for {{the introduction of new}} areas for agricultural production. One of these pedoclimatic factors is the position of vines on vineyard slope. The aim of this paper was to assess the effect of the grapevine position on the field slope on growth expressed by pruning weight and on cold hardiness of bud and cane grapevine. The research used relatively simple methods and it was conducted in a commercial hillside vineyard from Samburesti viticultural region in Romania. The grapevines used for this study were represented by three red grape varieties: Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, Vitis vinifera L. cv. Merlot, and Vitis vinifera L. cv. Feteasca Neagra. Annual growth of grapevine and cane maturation in the previous growing season was influenced by slope positions. The lowest pruning weight was recorder in Merlot planted {{at the top of the}} vineyard slope. For all grapevine cultivars we found statistically significant differences between vines cultivated on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> and vines cultivated on the foot of slope...|$|E
40|$|Landslide occurrences {{had caused}} failure of {{sheet pile wall}} located about 6 m from Bangunan Tambahan, Fakulti Kejuruteraan Mekanikal (FKM), Universiti Telcnologi Malaysia in Skudai, Johor. With the aim of {{investigating}} cause(s) of the failure, the slope stability conditions prior and after construction were simulated using SLOPE/W Version 3. 03. The results showed that effects of load of a newly filled water tank sited on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> contributed to subsident of the slope surface within the vicinity by creating tension cracks near its raft footing. The slope became more unstable as the soil moisture or pore-water pressure increased due to infiltration of rainwater. This has reduced the shear strength, in particular the cohesion value, c. The simulation also confirmed the hyphothesis that the global soil mass movement started from the hill top where the water tank was located toward the installed sheet pile. The combined mobilized shear force and lateral pressure of the global slope was about 8 times {{the strength of the}} sheet pile. The associated stresses are found {{to be related to the}} formation of the heave pushing up the soil at the toe of slope and soil under the road pavement adjacent to the new laboratory buildings...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} seismic {{liquefaction}} related to artificial fill embankment is complicated. In this study, by making using of Finn model, a typical artificial fill embankment was simulated {{by means of}} Finn model in FLAC. Numerical simulation {{results indicated that the}} pore water pressure of saturated sand soil increased extremely which resulted in the significant decrease of the effective stress. When the effective stress decreased approximately to zero, the liquefaction phenomena occurred. According to the change of pore water pressure at different locations and depths, three rules have been obtained. Firstly, the occurrence time for the first peak of pore water pressure coincided with the seismic peak acceleration of input wave. Secondly, the liquefaction occurred earlier in the upper layer of saturated sand soil than in the lower layer below the bottom of slope. However the duration of liquefaction in the lower layer of saturated sand soil was longer than in the upper layer. Thirdly, the upper layer of saturated sand soil was almost not liquefiable below the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope,</b> while the lower layer was easily liquefiable with long duration time. In summary, the characteristics of seismic liquefaction in the artificial fill embankment were closely related to the seismic wave, locations and depths of saturated sand soil in a slope. 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Torrential {{rainfall}} in mid-July 2009 triggered numerous geodisasters such as slope {{failure and}} debris flow in Chugoku and Northern Kyushu areas of Japan. A number of slope failures and debris flows occurred in Yamaguchi and Fukuoka prefectures resulting in extensive damage {{to human life}} and infrastructure. One {{of the most serious}} geodisasters included a slope failure followed by debris flow at Sasaguri-machi and Fukuchi-machi, Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. This paper summarizes the results of geotechnical investigations on the geodisaster sites in Fukuoka prefecture. The geotechnical investigation included determining a series of grain size distributions, consistency limits and conducting direct box shear tests for collapsed soils collected at six disaster sites. The generation mechanisms of slope failure followed by debris flow were also investigated by analyzing the precipitation, topography, geology, and strength properties of the collapsed soils. Moreover, slope deformation and stability analyses were coupled with an unsaturatedsaturated seepage analysis to investigate the slope failure mechanism. The main findings from the study are summarized as: The physical properties, such as the grain size distribution, the plastic limit and liquid limit of collapsed soils, are summarized and compared with the results of other failure slopes in the literature. The collapsed soil was characterized as being a well grained soil (the uniformity coefficient > 50) and highly weathered (the ignition loss > 5 z), however, with regard to the liquid limit and plastic index, there were no remarkable findings. The original shear strength for collapsed soils with natural water content is relatively large and slope failure doesn't occur because the cohesion in the shear strength is induced by a suction force between the soil particles under unsaturated condition. However, water seepage into the soil induces a drastic decrease in the shear strength, which is mainly caused by a decrease in cohesion (losing suction) resulting from soil saturation. In addition, the drained/undrained condition in the shear process is also sensitive to shear strength. For example, both water seepage and the shear process with constant volume cause an approximate 30 z reduction in shear strength for Fukuchi-machi and Sasaguri-machi soil samples. Therefore, the reduction of cohesive strength due to water seepage and the low permeability of the slope are the parameters which trigger geodisaster. Based on the results of slope deformation and a stability analyses which took the change in water pressure and cohesive strength into account, the geodisaster at Fukuchi-machi was simulated, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the shallow failure near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> occurred due to torrential precipitation of about 100 mm per hour which triggered a debris flow...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} fire history reconstructed from select coast redwood {{stands in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, California based on the fire scar record in specimens collected between 2008 and 2013. The research is one component of a larger multidisciplinary examination of indigenous burning practices in the Central California Coast region (Lightfoot et al. 2013). Research presented herein exhibits concordance with results from related studies, including analyses of soil phytolith content (Evett and Cuthrell 2013), faunal assemblages (Gifford-Gonzalez et al. 2013), and microscopic pollen and charcoal evidence (Cowart and Byrne 2013). Fire history research was conducted in three coastal watersheds in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, California using standard dendroecological techniques, {{as well as a}} novel statistical approach developed to address undated, floating chronologies. A total of 103 coast redwood samples were collected from 95 sample trees in 19 plots within the study area. The fire return intervals recorded from the dated redwood samples in this study were relatively frequent. Fire information was estimated for three focal management eras: the native and ranching eras (1600 - 1850), intensive commercial logging (1850 - 1950), and the modern fire suppression/sustainable harvest era (1950 - 2013). Results from dated fire scars indicate that fires were less frequent in the native and ranching period (mean FRI 7. 6 years; range 1 - 29) than the intensive logging period (mean FRI 3. 1 years; range 1 - 11), as well as the modern period (mean FRI 4. 6 years; range 1 - 12). However, use of a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) on undated, floating chronologies indicated that the probability of fire may have been quite high in the earlier period, and that three independent variables were significant predictors in assessing the annual probability of the occurrence of fire in the study area: physiographic zone; position on slope; and linear distance to pre-colonial, native habitation sites. The GLMM also indicates that fire probabilities are not distributed uniformly in study watersheds. Trees located in close proximity to native residential sites had a high probability of being burned than those farther away (42 - 69 % vs. 17 - 38 %). Similarly, <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> fire were more likely in all watersheds and physiographic zones, though varying in degree. The season of fire occurrence was determined for 85 % of the fire scars. Dormant or late season fires accounted for a combined total of 87 % of all fires for the entire period of record (1350 - 2013; 55 % dormant, 33 % late) - indicating that historic fires most likely took place between approximately mid-August to late March. Early season (approx. April to August) fires accounted for 13 % of fires. In the 1600 - 1850 period, combined dormant and late season fires accounted for 91 % of fires (64 % and 27 %, respectively), with 9 % of fires occurring in the early season. During the intensive logging period (1850 - 1950) combined dormant and late season fires accounted for 85 % of fires, and 15 % in the early season. In the modern era (1950 - 2013), dormant and late season fires still account for the majority of fires (86 %), but with a marked shift into the drier late season (mid-August - September), which now account for 43 % of fires. Early season fires represent 14 % of fires in this period. Though this study faced significant challenges (i. e. low sample density for earlier period specimens, large study area, experimental use of a GLMM), these data reveal interesting and potentially useful patterns of historic fire occurrence in the Santa Cruz Mountains, especially with respect to human influence over coastal fire regimes. All sources of information indicate that coastal Santa Cruz Mountains experienced far more ignitions than would be expected under a lightning-driven fire regime (roughly 4 strikes per century), and that human activity is strongly linked to fire frequency in throughout observable time periods. There is ample opportunity to improve on this data with future work in efforts to inform and refine modern approaches to resource management in this region...|$|E

In such cases, good engineering practice and experience suggest the use of tension cracks at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>slope</b> to flatten the exit angle {{at the lower end of}} the slip surface (Duncan 1996). Such cases are mostly ignored by most engineers due to the lack of solid engineering understanding <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> stability analysis limitations resulting in misleading factors of safety.|$|R
