25|$|While Ellis' {{personal}} atheism and humanism remained consistent, {{his views}} about <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> mental health changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions {{and at his}} institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In The Case Against Religiosity, a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists.|$|E

It created a general right to privacy (Griswold v. Connecticut), limited <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> public school (most prominently Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District v. Schempp), incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the States—prominently Mapp v. Ohio (the exclusionary rule) and Gideon v. Wainwright (right to appointed counsel),—and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police (Miranda v. Arizona); At the same time, however, the Court limited defamation suits by public figures (New York Times v. Sullivan) and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories.|$|E

His hold on power was short lived and lasted only a year. During this time, in August 1309, Ibn Taymiyyah {{was taken into custody}} and placed under house arrest for seven months in the new sultan's palace in Alexandria. He was freed when Al-Nasir Muhammad retook the position of sultan on 4 March 1310. Having returned to Cairo a week later, he was received by the sultan Al-Nasir. The sultan would sometimes consult Ibn Taymiyyah on religious affairs and policies during the rest of his three-year stay in Cairo. During this time he continued to teach and wrote his famous book Al-Kitab al-Siyasa al-shar'iyya (Treatise on the Government of the Religious Law), a book noted for its account of <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> politics.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table {{his experience as a}} senior officer in the Air Force Reserve. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the Christian right on the Republican Party so conflicted with Goldwater's views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as abortion, gay rights, and <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> public life. After narrowly winning re-election to the Senate in 1980, he chose not to run for a sixth term in 1986, and was succeeded by fellow Republican John McCain. A significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the Pentagon by placing the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{into the}} new millennium, the {{conversation}} on a National level turned to <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> ritual. In 1968, Theta Phi opened its doors to women of all faith and replaced the crucifix used in ritual to a cross. In 1988, there was discussion of removing the cross in ritual. The discussion was tabled during convention but {{it was decided that}} the cross would have a less prominent role in ritual In 1990, Theta Phi Alpha surveyed the sisters about the Catholic influences in the ritual. The most positive response was to adjusting the ritual to match the current views of the national fraternity, while the most negative response was to removing all references to God in the ritual. This dissonance between the sisters is still discussed today. However, Theta Phi Alpha is slowly removing religious aspects, in 1990 the Lord's Prayer was removed from the ritual. In 1992, the Theta Phi Alpha Prayer was removedand the following year a less religious ritual for deceased members and a nonreligious national philanthropy, The House that Theta Phi Alpha Built were introduced.|$|E

25|$|The most heated {{controversy}} {{was over}} {{the status of the}} Catholic Church. From a dominant position in 1788, it was almost destroyed in less than a decade, its priests and nuns turned out, its leaders dead or in exile, its property controlled by its enemies, and a strong effort underway to remove all influence of Christian religiosity, such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies. The movement to dechristianise France not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious. Napoleon's Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Catholic Church's traditional roles but not its power, its lands or its monasteries. Priests and bishops were given salaries as part of a department of government controlled by Paris, not Rome. Protestants and Jews gained equal rights. Battles over <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> the public sphere, and closely related issues such as church-controlled schools, that were opened by the Revolution have never seen closure. They raged into the 20th century. By the 21st century, angry debates exploded over the presence of any Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as the headscarves for which Muslim girls could be expelled. J. Christopher Soper and Joel S. Fetzer explicitly link the conflict over religious symbols in public to the French Revolution, when the target was Catholic rituals and symbols.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of Atatürk's {{reforms are}} called Kemalists, as {{distinguished}} from Islamists, representing the two diverging views regarding <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> legislation, education and public life. The Kemalist view supports {{a form of}} democracy with a laicist constitution and Westernised secular lifestyle, while maintaining the necessity of state intervention in the economy, education and other public services. Since the 1980s, issues such as income inequality and class distinction {{have given rise to}} Islamic populism, a movement that supports a larger role for religion in government policies, and in theory supports obligation to authority, communal solidarity and social justice; though what that entails in practice is often contested. Turkey under Tayyip Erdoğan and the AKP has been described as becoming increasingly authoritarian. Prior to the constitutional referendum in 2017 the Council of Europe saw Turkey drifting towards an autocracy, warning of a [...] "dramatic regression of its democratic order".|$|E
500|$|The {{sociology}} of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles {{of religion in}} society. There is particular emphasis on the recurring {{role of religion in}} all societies and throughout recorded history. The {{sociology of}} religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what Peter L. Berger has described as a position of [...] "methodological atheism". It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates among Roman Catholic and Protestant populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of economic sociology and social stratification: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), [...] (1915), [...] (1915), and Ancient Judaism (1920). Contemporary debates often centre on topics such as secularization, civil religion, the intersection of religion and economics and <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> a context of globalization and multiculturalism.|$|E

500|$|During {{all of his}} {{political}} campaigns, Romney has avoided speaking publicly about Mormon doctrines, referring to the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of religious tests for public office. But persistent questions about <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> Romney's life, as well as Southern Baptist minister and former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee's rise in the polls based upon an explicitly Christian-themed campaign, led to the December 6, 2007, [...] "Faith in America" [...] speech. In the speech Romney declared, [...] "I believe in my Mormon faith and endeavor to live by it. My faith is the faith of my fathers. I will be true {{to them and to}} my beliefs." [...] Romney added that he should neither be elected nor rejected based upon his religion, and echoed Senator John F. Kennedy's famous speech during his 1960 presidential campaign in saying, [...] "I will put no doctrine of any church above the plain duties of the office and the sovereign authority of the law." [...] Instead of discussing the specific tenets of his faith, he said he would be informed by it, stating: [...] "Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom. Freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone." [...] Academics would later study the role religion had played in the campaign.|$|E

Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's lack of complexity was refreshing, but ultimately the [...] "awkward" [...] performances and [...] "cheesy" [...] approach to its subject matter detracted from it. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B, describing it as [...] "an episode {{about a man who}} finds himself trying to lose his faith but being unable to do so". VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from [...] "the typical Millennium problems", including [...] "an overreliance on trite philosophical dialogue"; however, he found that it contained [...] "something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely". The episode's thematic concern with <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>in</b> society was noted as being [...] "the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on".
