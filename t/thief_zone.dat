50|$|The {{primary means}} of {{detecting}} a kick while drilling is a relative change in the circulation rate {{back up to the}} surface into the mud pits. The drilling crew or mud engineer keeps track of the level in the mud pits and/or closely monitors the rate of mud returns versus the rate that is being pumped down the drill pipe. Upon encountering a zone of higher pressure than is being exerted by the hydrostatic head of the drilling mud (including the small additional frictional head while circulating) at the bit, an increase in mud return rate would be noticed as the formation fluid influx blends in with the circulating drilling mud. Conversely, if the rate of returns is slower than expected, it means that a certain amount of the mud is being lost to a <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> somewhere below the last casing shoe. This does not necessarily result in a kick (and may never become one); however, a drop in the mud level might allow influx of formation fluids from other zones if the hydrostatic head at is reduced to less than that of a full column of mud.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA 3 D, multi-phase, multi-component {{numerical}} model of injection into a storage reservoir with an abandoned wellbore is developed. A shallow aquifer is modeled above the storage reservoir {{separated by a}} caprock layer. An intermediate permeable layer {{assumed to be a}} <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> is modeled. The abandoned wellbore penetrates the entire model from the surface, through shallow aquifer and <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> {{to the bottom of the}} primary storage reservoir. The amount of CO 2 captured within the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> and released to the shallow aquifer and atmosphere is assessed. A Latin Hypercube sample evaluates the effects of variations in CO 2 injection rate, depth of the reservoir, relative depth of the <b>thief</b> <b>zone,</b> and permeability of the wellbore, <b>thief</b> <b>zone,</b> and shallow aquifer. In addition, full factorial design parameter studies evaluate the effect of differing wellbore permeabilities above and below the <b>thief</b> <b>zone.</b> Analyses of the Latin Hypercube sample and parameter studies provide indications of the necessary conditions for secondary capture in thief zones and potential for leakage to the shallow aquifer and atmosphere...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{this paper}} {{focuses on the}} {{formation}} of <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> in mature reservoirs caused by variant of water phase saturation induced by the areal permeability heterogeneity during water flood. At first, a not very strict theory analysis shows that negligence of the uneven water saturation distribution cannot explain the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> appearing in mature reservoirs after many years development. Then, numerical simulation based on PEBI grids studies the characteristic of the pressure transient response for the wells located in the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> with high water saturation. Finally, {{a case study in}} Daqing oilfield is studied.|$|E
30|$|There {{have been}} many dynamic {{monitoring}} methods used to identify <b>thief</b> <b>zones.</b> Chetri et al. (2003) and Azim et al. (2003) used core, logs and injection profiles/production profiles to understand the vertical distribution of the water injected/oil produced and to identify <b>thief</b> <b>zones.</b> Feng et al. (2010) used well test method to quantitatively identify <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> between wells, and to estimate parameters of the reservoir. Li et al. (2008) presented a methodology of recognizing different types of <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> in the Mauddud carbonate reservoir through integration of high-resolution image logs with PLT, NMR and conventional logs, and detected the <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> in carbonate reservoirs by integrating borehole image with dynamic measurements.|$|R
30|$|Figures  4, 5 and 6 {{show that}} when ratio of k·k rw {{in the region}} to k·k rw in {{ordinary}} reservoir is 15.4 for case 1 and 7.26 for case 2, characteristics of <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> are obvious. Because the ratio of k {{in the region to}} k in ordinary reservoir is only two, the effective permeability difference is mainly caused by water saturation, which is induced by permeability heterogeneity. Therefore, the numerical simulation shows that the uneven water saturation could be main contribution to the formation of <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> in mature reservoirs.|$|R
30|$|In all, {{the results}} suggest that DTTM {{can be used as a}} foaming and water viscosification agent. Similar to polymer {{enhanced}} foam, viscosification is a means to increase foam stability, and thereby the effective viscosity of aqueous foams for gas mobility control. The surfactant can be injected in CO 2 or brine to generate foam in situ for reducing gas mobility in excessively gas processed <b>zones</b> (<b>thief</b> <b>zones).</b> Foam stability and propagation can be enhanced as the formation brine is viscosified in situ.|$|R
30|$|The flux in {{capillary}} {{is proportional}} to radius’ fourth power, and permeability {{is proportional to}} radius’ second power. Therefore, if the permeability in the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> is more than 20 times {{of that in the}} ordinary reservoir, the radius of the porous throat in <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> will be 4 times bigger than the porous throat radius in ordinary reservoirs. If the size of porous throats increases 4 times, the size of pore bodies will increase too. Therefore, not very strictly, the porosity of the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> is about more than 10 times bigger than the porosity of the normal reservoir, which may be not true.|$|E
30|$|In {{this field}} case, {{formation}} of the interpreted <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> is mainly determined by the water saturation difference. As mentioned before, the absolute permeability in the red color region is only 2.3 times of absolute permeability in ordinary reservoir, while the relative permeability k rw in the red color region is 3.9 times of relative permeability k rw in ordinary reservoir. Therefore, relative permeability k rw decided by water saturation has more contribution to high mobility in the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> than the absolute permeability does, which indicates that uneven water saturation distribution induced by permeability heterogeneity is main contribution to formation of <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> in mature reservoirs.|$|E
30|$|Although {{many studies}} have focused on the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> {{formation}} caused by areal or vertical absolute permeability heterogeneity, the effect of increasing water saturation induced by the areal permeability heterogeneity on the formation of thief zones is not fully studied. Bane et al. (1994) only refer to approached residual oil saturation of <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> and Feng et al.(2010) just take approached residual oil saturation as assumption. Furthermore, Zhong et al. (2007) find that some wells with the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> characteristics do not have water breakthrough at early stage; however, when injection pressure decreases at the late stage, injection rate of these wells is higher than before, which obviously cannot be explained by the absolute permeability difference.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to increase oil production and reserves in the Uinta Basin by demonstrating improved completion techniques. Low productivity of Uinta Basin wells is caused by gross production intervals of several thousand feet that contain perforated <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> and water-bearing zones, and unperforated oil-bearing intervals. Geologic and engineering characterization and computer simulation of the Green River and Wasatch Formations in the Bluebell field will determine reservoir heterogeneities related to fractures and depositional trends.

40|$|As {{the demand}} {{for oil and gas}} {{resources}} increases, the need to venture into more hostile environments becomes a dynamic focus in the petroleum industry. One problem associated with certain high risk formations is lost circulation. As a result, engineers have concentrated research efforts on developing novel Lost Circulation Materials (LCM??s) that will effectively treat <b>thief</b> <b>zones.</b> The most pioneering LCM??s require mixing energy to activate a reaction involving two or more chemicals. However, minimal research has been conducted to accurately predict downhole mixing capabilities. Therefore, this research focuses on developing a correlation between laboratory experiments and scaled model experiments for accurate prediction of downhole mixing energies in terms of flow rate for adequate mixing of lost circulation prevention fluids...|$|R
30|$|The {{well in the}} <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> has small {{pressure}} {{change and}} its bump of the pressure derivative is not obvious.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, the {{characteristic}} of transient pressure for the well in <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> {{is the small}} pressure change and relatively flat derivative at early stage.|$|E
30|$|The {{saturation}} {{difference is}} an important factor for the formation of some <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> in mature reservoir. The absolute permeability heterogeneity is the initial factor. The areal permeability heterogeneity and water displacing lead to the uneven saturation distribution in mature reservoirs. The increase of the water saturation in the high permeable region leads to higher value of k·k rw in the high permeable region than the value of k·k rw in ordinary reservoir, and gradually the high mobility region becomes the <b>thief</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
30|$|Although polymer {{flooding}} {{can boost}} the oil recovery to over 50  %, {{which is about}} 10  % higher than water flooding (Jiecheng et al. 2010), there is still half oil remaining in the reservoir. The effect of polymer flooding is limited due to the following reasons: Firstly, the heterogeneity is aggravated during the polymer flooding process, in which the water and polymer fingering phenomena happens along <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> and high permeability streak resulting in low sweep efficiency. Secondly, the polymer displacement formula {{is not able to}} reduce the interfacial tension, so the displacement efficiency is low. In those means, how to improve the oil recovery after polymer flooding can take both the sweep efficiency and displacement efficiency into account (Jishui and Yiqiang 2002; Ting and Xiusheng 2004; Stoll et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Viscoelastic {{surfactant}} solutions increase {{oil recovery}} by selectively modifying the viscosity of the injected displacing fluid in different zones of the reservoir. We demonstrate that flow resistance in high permeability zones is increased whereas {{no significant change}} in viscosity occurs in low permeability zones. This greatly reduces injected fluid losses via the high permeability route. In two phase flow in sandstones, recovery increases by about 25 %. Efficiency also increases {{by a factor of}} 3 as shown by the large reduction in injected volume at breakthrough. Consequently less fluid is lost through high permeability <b>thief</b> <b>zones.</b> Recovery is increased in carbonates as well but the efficiency is depleted due to apparent changes in wetting. The reduction in injected fluid before breakthrough has the potential to prolong the economical lifespan of water wet reservoirs...|$|R

This completion technique is believed to leave many potentially productive beds damaged and/or untreated, while allowing water-bearing and low-pressure (<b>thief)</b> <b>zones</b> {{to communicate with the}} wellbore. Geologic and engineering characterization has been used to define improved completion techniques. The study identified reservoir characteristics of beds that have the greatest long-term production potential...|$|R
30|$|As {{the major}} {{oil and gas}} fields are {{becoming}} more and more mature, wells start to experience water breakthrough problems due to the presence of the <b>thief</b> <b>zone.</b> As early in 1975 (Felsenthal and Gangle), the thin layers penetrated by water were called “thief zones” because they draw off large quantities of water and thereby impair the economics of the waterflood operation. In that paper, a <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> is defined as a relatively thin layer comprising 5  % or less of the net pay thickness and taking more than 25  % of the injected water in a given well. The <b>thief</b> <b>zone,</b> also called “super permeability” zone or “speed zone” in some other studies, is defined by Bane as laterally continuous stratigraphic unit of relatively high permeability and large pore radius, which has approached residual oil saturation (Bane et al. 1994).|$|E
30|$|Many {{factors can}} lead to the {{formation}} of the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> according to the current studies (Felsenthal and Gangle 1975; Li et al. 2008; Azim et al. 2003; Shawket et al. 2010; Feng et al. 2010). Firstly, the widely accepted view is the serious reservoir heterogeneity. Areal and vertical reservoir heterogeneity is considered as main causes of early water breakthrough (Shawket et al. 2010). Viewed as two-layer infinite homogenous reservoir, Feng et al. (2010) consider the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> as a high permeability layer with residual oil saturation and provides an approach to <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> identification based on the combination of wellbore pressure and layer flow rates. Layer thickness and gravity are also considered as factors of formation of thief zones. Secondly, in the fractured reservoirs, the fracture connecting the producer and injector will lead to water breakthrough and easily forms the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> (Li et al. 2008; Azim et al. 2003). Furthermore, some papers mention that the porosity structure of reservoirs will change distinctly after long-term water flooding due to the dissolution and erosion of the formation, which forms the high porosity and high absolute permeability channel and contributes to formation of thief zones (Li et al. 2008; Feng et al. 2010).|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{production}} well 1 has bigger production rate and smaller pressure change, while injection well 7 has bigger injection rate and smaller pressure change, {{which indicates that}} there is a high permeable zones connecting the two adjacent wells. Judging from fine geological study, there is a high permeability zone connecting the two wells and the absolute permeability difference is about two times. Incorporating with the transient pressure response, we judge that well 1 and well 7 are likely located in a <b>thief</b> <b>zone,</b> and the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> is mainly caused by water saturation difference.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to increase the}} recoverable heavy oil reserves within sections of the Wilmington Oil Field, near Long Beach, California.

It is hoped that the successful application of these technologies will result in their implementation throughout the Wilmington Field and through technology transfer, will be extended to increase the recoverable oil reserves in other slope and basin clastic (SBC) reservoirs. The existing steamflood in the Tar zone of Fault Block (FB) II-A has been relatively insufficient because of several producability problems which are common in SBC reservoir; inadequate characterization of the heterogeneous turbidite sands, high permeability <b>thief</b> <b>zones,</b> low gravity oil and non-uniform distribution of the remaining oil. This has resulted in poor sweep efficiency, high steam-oil ratios, and early breakthrough.

30|$|Thief {{zones are}} {{generally}} a channel with high absolute permeability. However, a not very strict theory analysis shows that neglecting {{the effect of}} variant of water saturation on formation of <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> in mature reservoirs cannot explain some thief zones in mature reservoirs. This paper focuses {{on the effect of}} water saturation on <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> development for wells in mature reservoirs with areal permeability heterogeneity. The water saturation increases in high permeable channel with water passing through, which gradually leads to higher value of water phase relative permeability, and thus leads to higher value of effective permeability k·k rw in the high permeable channel than that in surrounding reservoir. The gradually increasing difference of effective permeability k·k rw between permeable channel and surrounding reservoir would be the main reason for formation of thief zones in mature reservoir. The oil–water two-phase numerical model based on PEBI (perpendicular bisection) gridding is used to study effect of variant of water phase saturation on formation of <b>thief</b> <b>zone.</b> We find that relatively small pressure change and not obvious bump in pressure derivative curves during shut-in are indicators of thief zones in mature reservoirs. This finding provides a further understanding for the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> development and also gives us a guidance to interpret the buildup pressure data in the mature sandstone reservoirs. A field case study verifies the effectiveness of the new explanation.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, Fig.  5 again {{means that}} large {{difference}} of k·k rw between {{the region and}} ordinary reservoir leads to small pressure change and low bump of the pressure derivative, which would be an indicator of <b>thief</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{prediction}} of {{spatial distribution of}} reservoir and rock properties in Pennay field using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN) involve the use of seismic attributes as input to predict these properties (permeability, porosity, volume of shale, hydrocarbon saturation and net to gross) away from well control and the uncertainty in resulting maps were quantify {{in terms of its}} root-mean-square error (RMSE). Root–mean-square error is the Standard deviation of residual which is difference between the predicted values and observed values, i.e., input and output of the network. RMSE ranges from 0 to 1. Values closer to zero (0) indicate a fit that is more useful for prediction and also very high confidence level for the resulting output (Kellar and Perez 2002). RSME is also a way to quantify the uncertainty and measure of accuracy in prediction and the predictive power. Effective porosity was modelled at RMS error of 0.0053 with resulting average effective porosity of 0.295. The effective porosity slice on top of reservoir 2 (Fig.  15) revealed the lateral variation of effective porosity across the field with very high effective porosity areas coincide with the delineated regions of interests. The resulting reservoir permeability map (Fig.  16) was modelled at RMSE of 0.030, revealed some <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> (channel with high absolute permeability) within and outside the areas with well concentration. The average permeability of the reservoirs modelled by MLPNN was 635 md. Moreover, hydrocarbon saturation (Fig.  17) was also modelled at RMSE of 0.0282 with average of 69.9 % and volume of shale (Fig.  18) was modelled at RMSE of 0.028 and average volume of shale of 9 %. MLPNN-modelled map of net-to-gross (NTG) (Fig.  19) at RMSE of 0.0290 revealed that 72 % of the reservoir has a very high NTG (ratio of the volume of the sand in the reservoir to the total volume of the reservoir) with average NTG of 0.7184. A comparison of MLPNN slices of petrophysical properties on the mapped horizons revealed that relatively higher NTG, low volume of shale, high hydrocarbon saturation, high permeability and high effective porosity were observed in these regions of interest. MLPNN-modelled maps revealed some bypassed sand channels and some <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> (channel with high absolute permeability) within and outside the areas with well concentration that are not evident on the structural maps and attribute slices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Acid {{stimulation}} of carbonate formations using hydrochloric (HCl) acid-based systems to improve hydrocarbon production or water injection {{has been a}} common practice. The challenge of achieving full zonal coverage with the stimulation fluid still persists. This task is even more difficult in highly slanted layered, naturally fractured reservoirs exhibiting high permeability and porosity contrast. During acid stimulation treatments, the fluid has a natural tendency to take {{the path of least}} resistance, penetrating layers with the highest porosity and permeability while little or no acid is injected into lower-quality zones. Excessive fluid loss to these high-quality <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> results in a nonhomogenous distribution of stimulation fluids across the targeted interval. This leaves neighboring lower-quality zones unstimulated, preventing them from reaching their maximum potential. In this paper, a gel acid system composing hydrophobically modified PAM and viscoelastic surfactant (SA- 16) as a novel self-diverting acidizing system was introduced, which can lower acid loss. This novel system was evaluated on temperature stability, viscosity test, gel breaken and acid-rock kinetics test supported by laboratory study. Its favorably high viscosity, ideal gel breaken, upstanding temperature resistance and other prior properties can be applied to acid stimulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the impact of glacial and interglacial cycles and ice streaming on the sediments of the North Sea Basin. An improved understanding of the past cycles of glaciation, timing and extent, has far reaching implications for better understanding global climate change and ice-sheet behaviour. The 1000 metre-thick Quaternary sediment sequence of the North Sea Basin forms the overburden and geological seals to underlying CO 2 storage complexes and migration pathways (e. g. <b>thief</b> <b>zones)</b> for fluids. These Quaternary strata also form the foundations for offshore renewable installations and infrastructure for hydrocarbon exploration and extraction. The impact on geotechnical properties of glacial loading and unloading and lateral variation in these deposits is an important consideration for offshore development. Glacial geomorphology shapes the current sea-bed topography and glacial deposits determine sea-bed composition which impacts on the benthic community composition and distribution. Multibeam echosounder datasets have been combined with high-resolution topographic digital surface models (NEXTMap), 2 D seismic reflection profiles, shallow vibrocore and borehole samples. Initial interpretations reveal a complex interplay of overprinted glacial landforms and a vastly more varied distribution of sea-bed sediments, the coarser fraction of which are derived from glacial deposits...|$|R
30|$|The {{results can}} help us to {{understand}} thief zones better and offer {{a new way to}} identify some kind of <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> in mature reservoirs, which is not fractures or does not have a very big permeability difference compared to the surrounding formation.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, the {{magnitude}} of difference of water phase relative permeability between the <b>thief</b> <b>zone</b> and the ordinary reservoir is more likely the main contribution {{to the formation of}} some thief zones in mature reservoirs, while absolute permeability heterogeneity is a relatively minor factor, but it is the initial factor.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of suspension filtration in porous media {{has been established}} based on mass conservation principle and characteristics of particles depositing and blocking. On this basis, percolation rules and blocking characteristics of suspension in heterogeneous reservoir were investigated. It is showed that suspension injection could remarkably reduce the permeable ratio and improve the heterogeneity significantly. Low-speed and low-viscosity injection could achieve shallow profile control, and high-speed and high-viscosity injection could achieve deep profile control. Adjusting the injection rate or viscosity of carrying fluid slug {{at the right time}} to make the particle retention concentration profile in <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> and the water-flood front keep consistent could achieve dynamic profile control. For the reservoirs without a good interlayer, the optimum injection rate and viscosity of carrying fluid were chosen based on the connectivity of layers, and in the reservoirs with good interlayers the injection rate and viscosity should be lowered appropriately under the field permitting conditions. When the suspension concentration was constant, the instantaneous fractional flow of high permeable layer first decreased sharply and then ramped up with the increasing injection volume. Initial percolation coefficient is the basis of a high utilization of suspension and a good result in profile control.

40|$|CO 2 can {{flow upward}} and leak through <b>thief</b> <b>zones</b> due to {{buoyancy}} effect during geological sequestration. To tackle this issue, the ex situ dissolution (ESD) concept was introduced aiming at full dissolution of CO 2 at the surface, {{before it is}} injected into the ground, to increase the storage capacity and {{lower the risk of}} leakage. A mathematical model for CO 2 droplets evolution in the ESD process is presented, followed by an experimental investigation to verify the proposed model. The developed model accounts for the droplet break-up process and transient mass transfer involved in the ESD. A number of mathematical correlations were developed to compute the average droplet size, break-up frequency, and droplet population in a turbulent dispersion regime. Experimental and mathematical results revealed that a minimum stable CO 2 droplet is achievable within a pipeline length of less than 50 m if the CO 2 volume fraction is in the range of 5 – 15 % and the brine flow rate varies between 0. 25 and 2. 0 Mt/yr.
