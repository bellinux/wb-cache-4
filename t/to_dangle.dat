5|$|For its {{transition}} to Rougarou, the ride received three new floorless trains which allows riders' legs <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> freely above the track, {{as there is}} no floor between rows. Each has the same 32-rider configuration as the previous trains on Mantis. Riders are also secured by an over-the-shoulder harness with an interlocking seatbelt.|$|E
5|$|Griffon {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains, colored red, yellow, and black. Each train has three rows that seat ten riders across {{for a total}} of 30 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over-the-shoulder restraint with a seatbelt. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,400 riders per hour. Unlike traditional roller coasters, Griffon's trains are floorless, allowing the riders' legs <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> throughout the ride. Riders also experience up to 4 times the force of gravity.|$|E
25|$|Rosenqvist {{tried again}} at passing Verstappen {{entering}} Lisboa corner but the latter again held his position. Auer upfront was now holding a two-second {{advantage over the}} rest of the field, with the hope that no accidents would occur that would necessitate the safety car's deployment. However this would not happen as on the fourth lap, Verstappen lost control of his vehicle under braking in the Solitude Esses and broke his front-left suspension in an impact with the wall. This caused his wheel <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> off the car along with him sustaining a rear-left puncture. Verstappen lost all turning room while attempting to get round the Melco hairpin but returned to the pit lane and into retirement. In the group behind Latifi was overtaken by King while Coletti was being caught by Fuoco and Serrallés. The safety car was required on the same lap when MacLeod crashed and blocked half the track at Paiol corner since no recovery cranes were in that area of the track. Confusion was created under the safety car as it did not pick up race leader Auer but Goddard instead. Gelael returned to the pit lane to stop him impeding other drivers and retired. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap seven and racing resumed with Auer leading Rosenqvist.|$|E

25|$|In 1821, Greek nationalists in the Romanian Principalities {{and in the}} Peloponnese and the Aegean islands, {{launched}} a series of uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, aiming to liberate ethnic Greeks from three centuries of Ottoman rule (see Greek War of Independence). The Ottoman government responded with a determined effort to defeat the rebellion. For the Ottoman government, Greece was a core province. Its loss could not be contemplated, unlike other regions such as the Romanian Principalities and Serbia, which were considered peripheral vassal-states. The fear of the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II (ruled 1808–39), was that the secession of even {{a small part of}} Greece such as the Peloponnese would lead to demands by Greek nationalists for the liberation of all the other regions of the empire containing Greek majorities, including central Greece, Macedonia, Thrace, Constantinople itself, western Anatolia, the Aegean islands and Crete, threatening the empire's very existence. In addition, the Greeks were economically critical, as they dominated the empire's trade through their ownership of much of its merchant shipping. On a personal level, Mahmud considered the Greek revolt a monstrous betrayal by a conquered nation that had always been treated generously by the Porte. The Sultan vented his fury on the ethnarch and spiritual leader of the Greeks, the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, whom he suspected of colluding with the rebels. As the Patriarch emerged from his cathedral, in full regalia, after celebrating Easter Mass in April 1821, he was seized by Janissaries and hanged on the spot, from the cathedral gates. After being left <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> in public for three days, his corpse was dragged through the streets and flung into the Bosporus.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} films, the plot was criticized as incoherent and confusing. The Arizona Republic critic Bill Goodykoontz rated the film two out of five, stating that [...] "the movie {{is a series of}} distractions tossed together in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story. That never really happens." [...] Online reviewer James Berardinelli considered the script [...] "little more than a clothesline from which <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> all of the obligatory set pieces", and USA Todays Claudia Puig found On Stranger Tides [...] "familiar and predictable...often incoherent and crammed with pointless details." ...|$|E

2500|$|The hung oven was {{developed}} in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain. It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees. The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270 °C (525°F) for 30–40 minutes. While the ducks are cooking, the chef may use a pole <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> each duck closer to the fire for 30 second intervals. Almost every part of a duck can be cooked.

They also hung him up backwards, with his hands bound behind his back. Kurnaz is not sure how long he was suspended by his arms, but other prisoners informed him it was five days. Later he learned that this hanging treatment had killed prisoners at the Bagram base; he believes a prisoner in the room next to his died from being hung up by his arms.|$|E

2500|$|The cage {{giving way}} {{completely}} {{was a surprise}} to both Foley and The Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall. [...] Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes." [...] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir Have a Nice Day, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring he landed in had a harder surface than the modern rings do, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.|$|E

Thierry Nguyen of 1UP.com rated the game [...] "A" [...] and concluded, [...] "While Mass Effect 3 stumbles at times, the fact that it's the ultimate culmination of my own Shepard's story makes it one of the signature (and somewhat-literal) role-playing-games of this year." [...] Edge rated the game 8/10 saying [...] "It's off-putting to new players, too busy tying up loose ends <b>to</b> <b>dangle</b> any threads of its own, and fails to stand up as its own game in the same manner as its predecessors. But it's also a spectacular, powerfully imagined and dramatically involving final act to one of gaming's richest sci-fi sagas." [...] Tom Francis of PC Gamer U.S. gave the game a score of 93/100 and ended with saying [...] "...the end of the series is a mixed bag. Satisfying in some ways, nonsensical in others, and ultimately too simple. But the sheer scale of the adventure it's ending – and the music, which is gorgeous throughout – gives it an emotional impact that goes beyond its plot payload." [...] Mass Effect 3 was nominated for five awards in the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, including Game of the Year, and it won one, Best RPG. Game Informer awarded it their game of the year award.|$|E
