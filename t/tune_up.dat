500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the <b>tune</b> <b>up</b> and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{theme was}} composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills {{and was released}} as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. [...] The various parts were built up using musique concrète techniques, by creating tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test oscillators and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme <b>tune</b> <b>up</b> {{to the end of}} season 17 (1979–80). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, [...] "Did I write that?" ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tuned</b> <b>up</b> mopeds and light-mopeds {{involved}} in accidents; interview {{study of the}} settlement of such accidents {{by the police and}} insurance companies. Research has shown that many mopedists and light-mopedists ride faster than their speed limit allows. This is often the results of having <b>tuned</b> <b>up</b> their mopeds. This is illegal in The Netherlands. It could work preventatively if insurance companies were to use the so-called ‘right of recourse’, in this case because the vehicle involved had been <b>tuned</b> <b>up.</b> The present study deals with the following research questions: (1) Which procedure does the police follow if a (light-) moped {{involved in}} an accident has been <b>tuned</b> <b>up?</b> We refer specifically to the technical inspection and the summons. (2) How do insurance companies use the right of recourse if it appears that the (light-) moped involved had been <b>tuned</b> <b>up?</b> To answer the first question, the results were used of a 1999 SWOV study of serious accidents involving (light-) mopeds. What makes this study so special is that the policeman who had registered such an accident was telephoned for further information about that accident. For the present further study, a number of police stations were telephoned again, but only concerning the technical inspections. This further study established that the police issues a summons if a (light-) moped involved in an accident had been <b>tuned</b> <b>up.</b> Insurance companies can obtain such summonses together with the appropriate accident registration forms. This means that the insurance companies do not have to conduct a technical inspection to establish whether or not the (light-) moped involved in an accident had been <b>tuned</b> <b>up.</b> To answer the second question, three insurance companies were asked how they usually settled a claim for (material) damages. It was determined that insurance companies sometimes attempt to get the damages paid out to (light-) mopeds repaid, if it appears that the vehicles had been <b>tuned</b> <b>up.</b> This often leads to problems because the (light-) mopedists concerned do not have the money to reimburse the company. Insurance companies are recommended to be more consistent {{with the use of the}} right of recourse. Intensive contacts between young people will, anyway, lead to experiences with the rules governing damage payments being discussed in greater depth. It is also recommended that insurance policy terms be explained, using clear examples. This will increase the knowledge of the exclusions in the policy terms. It is desirable that general publicity about this subject be spread, together with attention for the theory certificate. It is further recommended that insurance companies agree uniformly what is meant by ‘tune up’. It can be assumed that the settlement of damages and publicity about this subject will then be more effective...|$|R
