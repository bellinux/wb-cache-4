5|$|Predators such {{as other}} ants and the <b>thorny</b> devil lizard (Moloch horridus) {{predominantly}} feed on Ochetellus workers; {{the number of}} ants that a <b>thorny</b> devil can consume per minute is around 24 to 45. The total number of ants consumed in a day can {{be as many as}} 2,500 individuals, based on an examination of the lizard's stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{are also}} eaten by various wild birds and mammals, {{including}} pronghorn, desert bighorn sheep, and deer. The <b>thorny</b> plants provide escape for cover for many small animals.|$|E
5|$|Tropical dry {{deciduous}} {{forests are}} found {{in all parts of}} the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. Large tracts of these forests have been cleared for cultivation. Tropical <b>thorny</b> forests, consisting of widely scattered <b>thorny</b> trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state. These forests are confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70cm), a mean annual temperature of 25–27°C and low humidity.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (<b>thorny</b> headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the <b>thorny</b> headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|Other {{common names}} for this species include black spotted ray, rough-skinned ray, roughback stingaree, Solander's ray, and <b>thorny</b> ray. There {{may be more}} than one species of {{porcupine}} ray, as is currently recognized.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban iguana {{makes its}} burrow near cacti or thistles, {{sometimes}} {{even within the}} cactus itself. These <b>thorny</b> plants offer protection and their fruit and flowers offer the iguanas food. In areas without cacti, the lizards make their burrows in dead trees, hollow logs, and limestone crevices.|$|E

5|$|Vegetation {{is typical}} of the Sahara-Sahel region, and is mainly desert with <b>thorny</b> steppe land. Soil erosion is a problem, as many {{previously}} wooded areas have disappeared as the locals use wood for fuel, and inadequate farming practices have sometimes resulted in soil exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in <b>thorny</b> bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.|$|E
5|$|Myrrh is a bitter-tasting, aromatic, {{yellow to}} reddish brown gum. It is {{obtained}} from small <b>thorny</b> flowering {{trees of the}} Commiphora genus, which {{is a part of}} the incense-tree family (Latin: Burseraceae). There are two main varieties of myrrh: bisabol and herabol. Bisabol is produced by C. erythraea, an Arabian species similar to the C. myrrha, which produces the herabol myrrh. C. myrrha grows in Ethiopia, Arabia, and Somalia.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} issues are aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the <b>thorny</b> issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E
5|$|Some bivalves, {{including}} the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the <b>thorny</b> oysters and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The dromedary's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation mostly <b>thorny</b> plants. A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%). The dromedary {{is primarily a}} browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.|$|E

5|$|Within its Indus valley {{breeding}} range in Pakistan and western India, the Sind sparrow is patchily distributed in riverine and wetland habitats with <b>thorny</b> scrub and tall grass. During the non-breeding season, some birds enter drier habitats as they disperse short distances from their breeding habitat, or migrate into western Pakistan and the extreme east of Iran. Since this species is fairly common and expanding its range, it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The Sind sparrow is social within small groups while feeding and breeding, and during its winter dispersal. It feeds mostly on seeds and less often on insects, foraging {{close to the}} ground. Nests {{are made in the}} branches of <b>thorny</b> trees, and are untidy globular masses constructed from grass or other plant matter and lined with softer material. Both sexes are involved in building the nest and caring for the young, and usually raise two clutches of three to five young each breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many <b>thorny</b> microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The <b>thorny</b> spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E

A powerful proton accelerator driving a sub-critical fission reactor could be used for producing energy more safely and burning up the extra spent fuel which so far has been stored in geological repositories...|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} Tapeigaster flies have been {{collected}} from the fruit bodies, including T.cinctipes, T.annulipes, and T.nigricornis; the latter species uses the fruit bodies as a host to rear its young. Fruit bodies in Springbrook National Park have been observed to attract nocturnal insects such as beetles, native cockroaches and crickets (white-kneed cricket (Papuastus spp.) and <b>thorny</b> cricket), as well as giant rainforest snails (Hedleyella falconeri) and red triangle slugs (Triboniophorus graeffei), which voraciously consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The colonies {{are found}} in rotten wood, in the ground, under rocks or stones and in urban areas. The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees, in low {{vegetation}} and into human homes, where they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, sucrose, nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The <b>thorny</b> devil, an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers, and other ant species also prey on them.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of <b>thorny</b> twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
