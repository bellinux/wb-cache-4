5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (<b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> power {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power: when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> less than <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power <b>is</b> 0; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> between <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> smooth output; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> between <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will maintain its maximum power; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> greater than <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will <b>be</b> 0. Therefore, based on the nonlinear relationship between wind speed and <b>wind</b> power, <b>the</b> prediction distribution of <b>wind</b> power <b>is</b> complex.|$|R
5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing towards the animals, indicating {{the sense of}} smell {{is more important than}} sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E

5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided {{they have the}} generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
5|$|Within Orkney, {{the council}} {{operates}} airfields {{on most of}} the larger islands including Stronsay, Eday, North Ronaldsay, Westray, Papa Westray, and Sanday. The shortest scheduled air service in the world, between the islands of Westray and Papa Westray, is scheduled at two minutes duration but can take less than one minute if <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> in the right direction.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E

5|$|Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> a 1939 American epic {{historical}} romance film {{adapted from}} Margaret Mitchell's 1936 {{novel of the}} same name. The film was produced by David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures and directed by Victor Fleming. Set in the American South {{against the backdrop of}} the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, to her marriage to Rhett Butler. The leading roles are portrayed by Vivien Leigh (Scarlett), Clark Gable (Rhett), Leslie Howard (Ashley), and Olivia de Havilland (Melanie).|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} powered by <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>is</b> distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong {{waves in the}} direction of its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing from {{one side or the}} other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E

5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone {{with the}} Wind {{set a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. Gone with the Wind also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, Gone with the Wind lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
5|$|The Birth of a Nation, Gone {{with the}} Wind, The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. and Avatar all {{increased}} their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases {{up to the}} point that they lost the record; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for Star Wars includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002; the total for Avatar—as the current record-holder—includes all its earnings at the present time. Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/general release/second-run) along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to The Sound of Music in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. The Godfather was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and Jaws was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. The Sound of Music, The Godfather, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013 and 2012 respectively, but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.|$|E
