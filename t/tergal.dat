5|$|Paranota plus leg gene {{recruitment}} hypothesis: The fossil larvae of Coxoplectoptera provided {{important new}} {{clues to the}} disputed question of the evolutionary origin of insect wings. Before the larvae fossil discovery the paranotal-hypothesis and the leg-exite-hypothesis have been considered as incompatible alternative explanations, which have both been supported {{by a set of}} evidences from the fossil record, comparative morphology, developmental biology and genetics. The expression of leg genes in the ontogeny of the insect wing has been universally considered as conclusive evidence in favour of the leg-exite-hypothesis, which proposes that insect wings are derived from mobile leg appendages (exites). However, the larvae of Coxoplectoptera show that the abdominal gills of mayflies and their ancestors, which are generally considered as corresponding structures to insect wings, articulated within the dorsal tergite plates. This cannot be seen in modern mayfly larvae, because their abdominal tergites and sternites are fused to rings, without any traces left even in embryonic development. If larval gills and wings are corresponding ("serial homologous") structures and thus share the same evolutionary origin, the new results from Coxoplectoptera demonstrate that also wings are of <b>tergal</b> origin, as proposed by the classical paranotal-hypothesis. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore suggested a new hypothesis that could reconcile the apparently conflicting evidence from paleontology and developmental genetics: wings first originated as stiff outgrowths of <b>tergal</b> plates (paranota), and only later in evolution became mobile, articulated appendages through secondary recruiting of leg genes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{axillary}} sclerite (lAx) is {{the anterior}} hinge plate {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the <b>tergal</b> margin. The anterior end of the sclerite is generally produced as a slender arm, the apex of which (e) is always associated with {{the base of the}} subcostal vein (Sc), though it is not united with the latter. The body of the sclerite articulates laterally with the second axillary. The second axillary sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first axillary, but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely hinged to the outer margin of the body of the first axillary, and the radial vein (R) is always flexibly attached to its anterior end (d). The second axillary presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron. The second axillary, therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E
5|$|Most {{termites}} are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, {{mechanical and}} pheromonal cues. These {{methods of communication}} are used {{in a variety of}} activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and <b>tergal</b> glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.|$|E
5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the <b>tergal</b> gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
25|$|The first {{axillary}} sclerite (lAx) is {{the anterior}} hinge plate {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the <b>tergal</b> margin.

The second axillary sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first axillary, but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely hinged to the outer margin of the body of the first axillary, and the radial vein (R) is always flexibly attached to its anterior end (d). The second axillary presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron.

25|$|The various {{movements}} of the wings, especially in insects that flex their wings horizontally over their backs when at rest, demand a more complicated articular structure at the wing base than a mere hinge of the wing with the body. Each wing {{is attached to the}} body by a membranous basal area, but the articular membrane contains a number of small articular sclerites, collectively known as the pteralia. The pteralia include an anterior humeral plate {{at the base of the}} costal vein, a group of axillaries (Ax) associated with the subcostal, radial, and vannal veins, and two less definite median plates (m, m') at the base of the mediocubital area. The axillaries are specifically developed only in the wing-flexing insects, where they constitute the flexor mechanism of the wing operated by the flexor muscle arising on the pleuron. Characteristic of the wing base is also a small lobe on the anterior margin of the articular area proximal to the humeral plate, which, in the forewing of some insects, is developed into a large, flat, scale-like flap, the tegula, overlapping the base of the wing. Posteriorly, the articular membrane often forms an ample lobe between the wing and the body, and its margin is generally thickened and corrugated, giving the appearance of a ligament, the so-called axillary cord, continuous mesally with the posterior marginal scutellar fold of the <b>tergal</b> plate bearing the wing.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>tergal</b> {{plates of}} the thorax are simple {{structures}} in apterygotes {{and in many}} immature insects, but are variously modified in winged adults. The pterothoracic nota each have two main divisions: the anterior, wing-bearing alinotum and the posterior, phragma-bearing postnotum. Phragmata (singular: phragma) are plate-like apodemes that extend inwards below the antecostal sutures, marking the primary intersegmental folds between segments; phragmata provide attachment for the longitudinal flight muscles. Each alinotum (sometimes confusingly {{referred to as a}} [...] "notum") may be traversed by sutures that mark the position of internal strengthening ridges, and commonly divides the plate into three areas: the anterior prescutum, the scutum, and the smaller posterior scutellum. The lateral pleural sclerites are believed to be derived from the subcoxal segment of the ancestral insect leg. These sclerites may be separate, as in silverfish, or fused into an almost continuous sclerotic area, as in most winged insects.|$|E
60|$|Scuta, triangular; {{internally}} concave, {{with a large}} depression for the adductor muscle; {{there is}} the usual small roughened internal knob, or tooth, at the rostral angle of both {{the right and left}} hand valves. <b>Tergal</b> margin straight, overlapping about one third of the entire width of the terga.|$|E
60|$|Scuta, {{exterior}} surface convex, sub-triangular, {{with the}} apex truncated: seen vertically from above, {{there is a}} small rectangular indentation or fold which receives the projecting scutal margin of the terga. The inner growing or corium-covered surface (fig. 1 b, b´) is triangular, with its <b>tergal</b> margin largely hollowed out. Along the occludent margin there is a slight ridge, which terminates at the rostral angle, in both the right and left-hand valves, in a rounded, knob-like, roughened tooth. The lower part of the <b>tergal</b> margin is slightly inflected and roughened, where it meets the corresponding lower part of the scutal margin of the terga. There is a deep pit for the adductor muscle. The interior surface of the valve above this pit is faintly-coloured purple. The inner surfaces of both scuta and terga, are roughened with little points.|$|E
60|$|Terga, {{larger than}} the scuta, {{internally}} (fig. 1 a) slightly concave; carinal margin much curved and protuberant; basal angle blunt; scutal margin either curved with the upper part straight, or formed of two almost distinct lines, corresponding with the <b>tergal</b> margin of the scutum, and {{with one of the}} sides of the upper latus.|$|E
60|$|The Scuta are triangular, {{with their}} umbones or centres of growth at the apex; the <b>tergal</b> margin, {{as seen from}} within, is either nearly {{straight}} or much hollowed out, accordingly as the scuta simply overlap the terga, or are received in a furrow. In some of the species there is a distinct pit for the adductor muscle, and in others this cannot be distinguished.|$|E
60|$|Terga, {{projecting}} {{beyond the}} other valves to an unusually small degree, broadly oval; basal angle bluntly pointed, apex rounded, blunt; scutal margin, hollowed out {{to receive the}} upper part of the <b>tergal</b> margin of the scuta; carinal margin curved and protuberant; occludent margin consists of two short sides at right angles to each other. The whole valve in length and area is about equal to the scuta; internally, somewhat concave.|$|E
60|$|Scuta, triangular, {{slightly}} overlapping the terga; {{the line}} of junction between these valves slightly sinuous, {{the upper part of}} the <b>tergal</b> margin of the scuta being slightly hollowed out, and the corresponding upper portion of the margin of the terga being slightly protuberant. Internally, there is a considerable depression for the adductor muscle; and besides the usual knob at the rostral angle, there is a trace of a knob at the baso-tergal angle.|$|E
60|$|Scuta, elongated, {{nearly three}} times as long as broad; apex, pointed; basal margin {{extremely}} oblique, forming an acute angle with the occludent margin; the lateral margin is slightly hollowed out, and is separated from the <b>tergal</b> margin by a large rectangular projection or shoulder. The occludent margin is nearly straight; externally, there is a slight ridge running {{down the middle of}} the valve, from the apex to the baso-lateral angle; and a second ridge running from the apex to the tergo-lateral angle. The lines of growth do not end abruptly at the tergo-lateral angle, as is the case with S. ornatum and several fossil species, but run up a little way along the <b>tergal</b> margin. The umbo is seated at the uppermost point, and, therefore, the main growth is downwards. There is a large rounded depression for the adductor muscle (a, fig. 2 a´), and higher up, opposite the tergo-lateral angle, there is another hollow (b), for the lodgment of the males; this latter is of nearly the same shape as the hollow for the adductor muscle, but rather more conspicuous than it. From the appearance of the under surface of the scuta, it might readily have been thought, that there had been two adductor muscles.|$|E
60|$|Valves white, thin, translucent; {{teeth on}} the {{projecting}} rims small, narrow, standing further apart {{than their own}} width. The upper layers have undergone but little disintegration or scaling off, and consequently the carina and terga project freely. The valves, where not rubbed, are covered by bright yellow membrane, which is thickly clothed with rows of spines; these are small on the exterior surfaces, but are very large and hooked in certain parts, as near the <b>tergal</b> margins of the scuta, and on the carinal margins of the terga, and especially on the inner face of the upper free part of the carina. Here the hooked spines (fig. 4 d) are trifid or quadrifid, and are very conspicuous.|$|E
60|$|Scuta (fig. 1, a), sub-triangular, {{with the}} lower part rounded and protuberant, the upper {{produced}} and pointed. The umbo is situated {{in the middle of}} the occludent margin, instead of at the rostral angle, as in the foregoing genera. The occludent margin is straight, and is bordered by a narrow step or ledge, formed of transverse growth-ridges, and therefore has its edge serrated: the rostral angle is often slightly produced into a small projection. The basal margin is short, and forms an angle above a rectangle with the occludent margin: the <b>tergal</b> margin is straight; the carinal margin is rounded, protuberant, and of unusual length compared to the basal margin. The surface of the valve is convex near the umbo; and beneath there is a large deep hollow for the adductor muscle.|$|E
60|$|Terga large, four-sided, {{with the}} {{internal}} growing surface (fig. 3 a´ b), almost diamond-shaped; basal angle blunt, rounded; exteriorly, from the apex to the basal angle there is a rather broad, very slight prominence, which bears the same relation to the carina and upper latus, as do the compound ridges on the scuta to the rostrum and upper latus. The {{upper part of the}} scutal margin forms a slightly-projecting, rounded shoulder, though variable in its degree of prominence, in relation to the variable depth of the recipient furrow in the scuta. Externally, parallel to the occludent margin, and close below the prominent shoulder, just mentioned, there is a slight and variable depression, extending up to the apex of the valve. This depression is due to the prominence, variable in degree, of the <b>tergal</b> edge of the recipient furrow in the scuta.|$|E
60|$|As each valve often {{requires}} (especially amongst the fossil species) a distinct description, I {{have found it}} indispensable to give names to each margin. These have mostly been taken from {{the name of the}} adjoining valve, (see fig. I.) In Lepas, Pollicipes, &c., the margin of the scutum adjoining the tergum and upper latus, is not divided (fig. II) into two distinct lines, as it is in Scalpellum, and is therefore called the Tergo-lateral margin. In Scalpellum (fig. I) these two margins are separately named <b>Tergal</b> and Lateral. The angle formed by the meeting of the basal and lateral or tergo-lateral margins, I call the Baso-lateral angle; that formed by the basal and occludent margins, I call, from its closeness to the Rostrum, the Rostral angle. In Pollicipes the carinal margin of the tergum can be divided into an upper and lower carinal margin; of this there is only a trace (fig. I) in Scalpellum.|$|E
60|$|Varieties.--The {{specimens}} {{from near}} Naples, (which I owe to {{the kindness of}} the Rev. F. W. Hope,) are somewhat larger, and differ slightly from those of Britain: they form, I imagine, the S. Siciliæ of Chenu. After carefully examining them internally and externally, I think it is quite impossible to consider them specifically distinct, for although in several specimens, the valves were placed a little further apart from each other,--the upper latera a little more elongated,--the carinal latera rather narrower in their upper half,--the infra-median latera rather more rounded,--and, lastly, in the scuta, the <b>tergal</b> margin extended almost in the same line with the lateral margin; nevertheless in other specimens, I could perceive no difference whatever. It is, however, remarkable that in several full-grown Neapolitan specimens there were no Complemental males, whereas I {{have never seen a}} single full-grown British specimen without such being present. In some specimens in the British Museum, without any given locality, I have observed considerable variation in the breadth of the carinal and rostral latera.|$|E
60|$|As we {{have just}} seen that the first pair of natatory legs is borne on the ninth segment of the body, {{so it must be}} with the first pair of cirri, which {{consequently}} correspond to the outer maxillipods (the two inner pair of maxillipods or pied-machoires being here aborted) of the higher Crustacea, and hence their difference from the five posterior pair, which correspond with the five, ordinary pair of ambulatory legs in these same Crustacea. The part of the body, which I have called the prosoma, that is the protuberant, non-articulated, lower part of the thorax (Pl. IX, fig. 4 n), is a special development, either of the ninth segment, bearing the first pair of cirri, or of the segments corresponding with the organs of the mouth. The three abdominal segments of the larva are represented in the mature Cirripede, in the Order containing the Lepadidæ, only by a minute, triangular gusset, let in between the V-shaped <b>tergal</b> arches of the last thoracic segment: in this gusset, small as it is, is seated the anus, and on each side the caudal appendages, often rudimentary and sometimes absent. In another order, I may remark, (including, probably, the Alcippe of Mr. Hancock,) the cirri, of which there are only three pair, are abdominal.|$|E
60|$|Scuta {{slightly}} convex, thrice {{as long as}} broad; {{upper part}} much acuminated; occludent margin almost straight; basal margin nearly {{at right angles to}} the occludent margin; the <b>tergal</b> margin is separated from the lateral margin by an angle more or less prominent; a slight curved ridge runs from the umbo to this angle, and this deserves especial notice, inasmuch as it indicates the outline which the valve assumed in its earliest growth, and which is permanently retained in most of the older fossil species. Along the occludent margin, there is a trace of a ledge, developed in a variable degree, and which is noticed only on account of the plainly visible ledge along this same margin, in the allied genus Oxynaspis. The umbo, or centre of calcification, is seated close to the occludent margin, and at about one fourth of the length of the valve from the apex. Internally, (fig. 15, a´, Pl. V,) the part above the umbo is flat; and beneath this upper part, there is a large rounded hollow (d) for the adductor muscle: a fold or indentation (a) running downwards from the umbo, extends in a very oblique line across the occludent margin. This fold is of high interest as giving lodgment to the Complemental Males, and will hereafter often be referred to.|$|E
60|$|Terga, seen externally, {{are almost}} {{quadrilateral}} (owing {{to the apex}} being truncated), with the free margin facing the scutum, arched. Seen vertically from above, each shows a deep fold, which receives {{the lower part of}} the <b>tergal</b> margin of the scutum. In the foregoing species, a prominent ridge runs down the exterior surface of the terga from the apex to the basal angle, against which ridge, the margin of the overlapping scuta abuts: here this ridge, instead of projecting straight out, is oblique or folded over, and thus forms a furrow, receiving the margin of the scuta. The interior growing surface of the tergum (fig. 1 b´, c), presents so irregular a figure, that it can hardly be described; in area it quite equals the scuta; it is slightly concave; at the upper point of the carinal margin, there is a large, rounded, protuberant, roughened knob, which corresponds with a small knob on each side of the inner face of the carina; these knobs seem firmly united together by membrane. The scutal margin of the terga, in the upper part, forms a shoulder, largely projecting over the scuta; on its lower part, there is a small roughened projection. The occludent margin is arched and protuberant, with a slight fold above the knob on the carinal margin, just mentioned: this fold is caused by the protuberance of the central internal ridge of the carina, but is so small, that when the capitulum is seen from vertically above, it can hardly be distinguished. Finally, the basal half of the carinal margin, runs in the same line with the basal margin of the scuta.|$|E
60|$|The scutum {{overlaps}} either {{about one}} third or even {{one half of the}} entire width of the tergum, and abuts against a prominent longitudinal ridge on its exterior surface. In L. truncata and L. Valentiana, this ridge on the tergum being folded over towards the scutum, forms a conspicuous furrow, receiving the <b>tergal</b> margin of the latter. In L. Valentiana, there is a second furrow on the carinal side of the tergum, receiving {{the upper end of the}} corium-covered or growing surface of the carina. Besides these provisions for holding together the valves, there are, apparently, others for a similar purpose; thus in each scutum, under the rostral angle, there is a roughened knob-like tooth, which touches the under side of the little rostrum, and no doubt serves to give attachment to the membrane uniting the three valves together. In some species, the adjoining basal margins of the scuta and terga, where touching each other, are inflected and roughened; again in L. Rhodiopus, the carinal angles of the terga are produced into points, and in L. truncata and L. Valentiana into prominent roughened knobs, which touch two corresponding small knobs, on the upper part of the growing surface of the carina. Moreover, considerable portions of the inner surfaces of the scuta and terga, are roughened with minute sharp, imbricated points, apparently for the firmer attachment of the corium. The roughened knobs at the rostral angles of the scuta, no doubt are homologous with the teeth in a similar position on one or both scuta in Lepas, and in some fossil species of Pollicipes, as in P. validus. The other projections and roughened surfaces are peculiar to Lithotrya. The growth of all the valves is, as in Pollicipes, simply downwards.|$|E
60|$|Description.--The valves, as just stated, {{generally}} {{resemble those}} of L. truncata; scarcely any appreciable difference can be detected in the scuta; the apex, however, of the inner surface seems coloured a darker purple. The terga, as seen from vertically above (Pl. VIII, fig. 5 b), have a fold or indentation on the upper or occludent margin, as large and as conspicuous as that receiving {{the margin of the}} scuta: this fold, as seen on the inner corium-covered surface (fig. 5 a), descends below the roughened knob at the upper angle of the carinal margin, which is not the case with the slight fold in the same place in L. truncata; its presence seems caused by the edge of the central internal crest, in {{the upper part of the}} carina, being square (instead of round, as in L. truncata), and thus more deeply affecting the outline of the terga, between which it is inserted. The upper part of the scutal margin of the terga, as seen internally (fig. 5 a), overlaps the scuta in a large rectangular projection. From the depth of the two opposite folds, namely, that caused by the <b>tergal</b> edge of the scuta and that by the crest of the carina, the inner face of the tergum is divided into two almost equal areas. The carina has its central crest square (fig. 5 c, d,) instead of being rounded as in L. truncata. The inner growing or corium-covered face is nearly at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the whole valve, instead of being oblique to it; it is convex or protuberant, with a central raised line, and two little knobs on each side of the upper part; the two lateral margins are slightly hollowed out, and the basal margin is not highly protuberant. The rostrum is excessively minute, barely above 1/200th of an inch in width; it is a little enlarged at each zone of growth. Latera lost; no doubt they were rudimentary.|$|E
60|$|Alimentary Canal.--The {{oesophagus}} is {{of considerable}} length: it is formed of strong, transparent, much folded membrane, continuous with the outer integuments, and moulted with them: it {{is surrounded by}} corium, and as already stated, by numerous muscles: at its lower end it expands into a bell, with the edges reflexed, and sometimes sinuous: this bell lies within the stomach, and keeps the upper broad end expanded. According to the less or greater distance of the mouth from the adductor muscle, the oesophagus runs in {{a more or less}} parallel course to the abdominal surface between the first and succeeding pairs of cirri, and enters the stomach more or less obliquely. In Ibla alone, it passes exteriorly to, and over the adductor scutorum muscle. The stomach lies in a much curved, almost doubled course; it is often a little constricted where most bent; it is broadest at the upper end, and here, in Lepas and Conchoderma, there are some deep branching cæca; in the latter of these two genera, the whole surface is, in addition, pitted in transverse lines. The stomach is coated by small, opaque, pulpy, slightly arborescent glands, believed to be hepatic; these are arranged in longitudinal lines, in all the genera, except in Alepas, in which they are transverse and reticulated: the whole stomach is thus coated. There is, also, a coating of excessively delicate, longitudinal and transverse muscles without striæ. The rectum varies in length, extending inwards from the anus to between the bases of the second and fifth pair of cirri: it is narrow, and formed of much folded transparent membrane, resembling the oesophagus, continuous with the outer integuments, with which it is periodically moulted. The anus is a small longitudinal slit, in the triangular piece of membrane representing the abdomen, let in between the last thoracic <b>tergal</b> arches, as already mentioned under the head of the Metamorphoses; it lies almost between the caudal appendages, and opens on the dorsal surface. Within the stomach, there can generally be plainly seen, in accordance with the period of digestion when the specimen was taken, a thin, yet strong, perfectly transparent epithelial membrane, not exhibiting under the highest power of the microscope any structure: it enters the branching cæca, and extends {{from the edge of the}} bell of the oesophagus to the commencement of the closed rectum, and consequently terminates in a point: it consists of chitine, like the outer integuments of the animal, and by placing the whole body in caustic potash, I have dissolved the outer coats of the stomach, and seen the bag open at its upper end, perfectly preserved, floating in the middle of the body, and full of the debris of the food. In most of the specimens which I have examined, preserved in spirits of wine, this epithelial lining was some little way distant and separate from the coats of the stomach; and hence was thought by M. Martin St. Ange to be a distinct organ, like the closed tube in certain Annelids. Occasionally, I have seen one imperfect epithelial bag or tube within another and later-formed one. Digestion seems to go on at the same rate throughout the whole length of the stomach; if there be any difference, the least digested portions lie in the lower and narrower part. The prey, consisting generally of crustacea, infusoria, minute spiral univalves, and often of the larvæ of Cirripedes, is not triturated: when the nutritious juices have been absorbed, the rejectamenta are cast out through the anus, all kept together in the epithelial bag, which is excluded like a model of the whole stomach, with the exception of that part coated by the bell of the oesophagus. I have sometimes thought that the bag was formed so strong, for the sake of thus carrying out the excrement entire, so as not to befoul the sack. I believe Lepas can throw up food by its oesophagus; at least, I found in one case, many half-digested small Crustaceans in the sack, and others of the same kind in the stomach.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the three}} living species of Chamaesipho, {{the shell of}} C. grebneffi begins with 6 plates, fusing {{completely}} at about 2 mm diameter. Freegrown specimens show a stellate basal outline. The scutum is highly distinctive in <b>tergal</b> margin equal in length to basal margin. In all other Chamaesipho, <b>tergal</b> margin is much shorter than basal. The tergum is not definitely identified.|$|E
50|$|The scutum {{possesses}} a clear rounded adductor ridge, best developed of all species of Chamaesipho. Articular ridge is large, rounded, with deep articular furrow. The tergum {{is higher than}} the other two species, with a broad distinct articular furrow, and 3-7 <b>tergal</b> depressor crests, and no <b>tergal</b> spur. Card setae are present only on anterior rami of cirrus I and cirrus II.|$|E
50|$|Kinorhynchs have <b>tergal</b> and sternal plates too, though {{seemingly}} not homologous {{with those}} of arthropods.|$|E
