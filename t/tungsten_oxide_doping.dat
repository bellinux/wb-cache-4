40|$|Abstract. Nanocrystalline <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>doped</b> {{titanium}} dioxide (WOx-TiO 2) powders were prepared by TiCl 4 hydrolysis and characterized by XRD, XPS, UV–Vis absorption spectra and TEM. Results showed that WOx not only hindered {{the growth of}} TiO 2 particles but also greatly increased the transformation temperature (> 800 oC) from anatase to rutile during sintering; the dominant fraction of <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> was non-stoichiometric <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> (WxOy) with W n+ (4 <n< 6), which could easily substitute Ti 4 + in the lattice of TiO 2. The light absorption band of TiO 2 changed from the near UV to the visible light range (2. 68 eV in 1. 0 %WOx-TiO 2) because of the tungsten impurity energy level induced by WxTi 1 -xO 2. The photocatalysis experiments demonstrated that the MB in aqueous solution was successfully degraded within 1 h using WOx-TiO 2 with an optimal WOx dosage of 1 % under visible light irradiation...|$|R

The films were analysed by X-ray diffraction, SEM/EDAX, Raman, electronic spectra, contact angle and photoactivity with respect to destruction of an over layer of stearic acid. The TiO 2 /WO 3 films were shown to be mixtures of two phases TiO 2 and WO 3 rather than a solid solution TixWyO 2.

40|$|With {{an attempt}} to {{investigate}} the effect of gold impurity and <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> on the recombination and separation of electron-hole pairs, and disclose the effect of surface state on the photo-catalytic activity of TiO 2, an innovative photo-catalyst 3 % WO 3 / 0. 5 %Au 3 +/TiO 2 was prepared by means of sol-gel method. The photo-oxidation efficiency of photo-catalyst was evaluated by conducting a set of experiments to photo-degrade methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution. The surface state properties were examined by means of surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) and electron-field-induced SPS (EFISPS). The experiments demonstrate that the strongest peak is attributed to electron excited from valence band to conduction band and the second strongest peak is attributed to electron excited from valence band to oxygen molecular for all samples. Electron is trapped by O- 2 absorbed {{on the surface of}} TiO 2. And,the surface state of O- 2 (-) forms. For (1 %, 3 %) Au 3 +/TiO 2 sample, two new peaks that significantly present at 414 nm and 400 nm respectively should be attributable to gold impurity energy level. And for <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>doping</b> samples, 4 peaks that significantly present in the region of 500 similar to 800 nm should be attributable to tungsten impurity energy level. The intensity of EFISPS decreases with increasing the content of gold ion or <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> when its content is no more than their optimal dosage. However, when the content of gold ion or <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> is more than their optimal dosage, impurity energy level becomes recombination center from separation center and the intensity of all peaks increases for them...|$|R
40|$|Metal oxide {{thin films}} {{are the subject}} of {{considerable}} research due to their novel optical and electrical properties which make them suitable for use in many applications. These applications include gas sensors, solar cell arrays, anti dazzling rear view mirrors, smart windows, gate dielectrics, semiconductors and many more. The possibilities for new metal oxide based materials is forever growing with the introduction of novel deposition methods which allow precise control of the deposition parameters and the ability to dope in order to tailor properties. The conditions used for the deposition of these coatings has an influence on the microstructure which in turn {{plays an important role in}} determining physical properties, such as the optical transmission and electrical conductivity. In addition, for many metal oxide materials the structure-property relationship is not well understood. The aim of this thesis was two-fold. Firstly, to deposit some metal oxide thin film coatings using several physical vapour deposition techniques and characterise their microstructure and physical properties. Secondly, to make a comparison between films deposited using different techniques to determine how the properties of a film depend on the conditions under which they are formed. To achieve these aims, <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide,</b> zinc <b>oxide</b> <b>doped</b> with aluminium (also known as aluminium zinc oxide - AZO) and hafnium oxide coatings were deposited and the microstructure and physical properties were investigated. For <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> deposition, films were deposited using pulsed magnetron sputtering and pulsed cathodic arc. It was found that films deposited using magnetron sputtering were highly disordered. In contrast, those deposited with cathodic arc were a highly ordered and exhibited a tetragonal phase, usually only observed at high temperatures. In the case of AZO, films were deposited using pulsed cathodic arc, pulsed magnetron sputtering and high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS). The pulsed cathodic arc films were found to have both good transmittance in the visible region and the best resistivity of all of the samples. It was found that magnetron and HIPIMS produced films that exhibited non-uniform properties across their surface due to in situ oxygen bombardment during deposition. This undesirable effect was eliminated by incorporating a novel magnetic filter into the deposition setup which acted to improve both the crystallinity and the resistivity. This thesis also performed the first comprehensive investigation of hafnium oxide films prepared using a filtered cathodic vacuum arc. Samples deposited at high substrate biases were found to damage readily which made them electrically leaky. Samples deposited at room temperature were found to have a disordered microstructure and had a good electrical breakdown. At elevated temperatures the crystallinity of the samples increased, resulting in a microstructure containing large monoclinic crystals. However, it was also found that the electrical breakdown worsened at elevated temperatures, in agreement with other researchers who also find that hafnium oxide films with disordered microstructure have the best electrical characteristics. Ab initio calculations of the near edge structure found in x-ray and electron loss edges were found to be a powerful way of distinguishing between the phases of <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide...</b>|$|R

40|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) is {{a versatile}} method for material preparation. Materials from films to nanostructures {{can be obtained}} by tuning the parameters of the CVD method. In the field of one-dimensional nanostructures, CVD is the most extensively employed method. This dissertation is focused on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> nanowires by the CVD method as well as the growth mechanism of these two kinds of one-dimensional materials. The first part of this dissertation focuses on CNTs. After an introduction to CNTs, the synthesis of bulk CNTs with high purity is explored. In chapter 2, the synthesis of few-walled carbon nanotubes (FWNTs) with ethanol as carbon source is explored. It is proved that addition of methanol to ethanol increases the purity of raw FWNT materials. Methanol acts as "carbonaceous impurities remover" to remove impurities deposited on the MgO support and also hinders the formation of such impurities during FWNTs growth. In Chapter 3, the synthesis of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) with high purity and small size distribution using FeSi 2 as catalyst is described. In FeSi 2, iron is dispersed at atomic scale, and thus it is possible to provide uniform iron particles for CNT growth. In chapter 4, a two-stage model for the growth of SWNTs is proposed, which may explain the low yield of SWNT growth in some early results. In this model, growth of SWNTs is divided into two stages, nucleation and growth. These two stages need different carbon feeding rates. To obtain a high yield of SWNTs, different carbon feeding gases should be applied to different stages. In chapter 5, a small amount of Zn is reported to increase the yield of SWNTs grown on SiO 2 /Si wafers. This phenomenon is abnormal and can not be explained with general accepted CNT growth mechanism. More effort is needed to elucidate the mechanism of high SWNT yield obtained under assist of Zn. The second part of this dissertation is focused on <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> nanowires. Potassium <b>doped</b> <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> and a <b>tungsten</b> bronze nanowires were synthesized with a simple CVD system on tungsten plate.

30|$|To {{achieve a}} high ODS efficiency, an {{important}} issue is finding a highly active catalyst. Currently, task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs) (Zhu et al. 2013 d; Kulkarni and Afonso 2010; Zhang et al. 2013; Wishart 2009; Zhu et al. 2013 c; Jiang et al. 2015 b), metal oxides (Xiao et al. 2016; He et al. 2015; Gonzalez et al. 2017; Rodriguez-Gattorno et al. 2009), polyoxometalates (Zhang et al. 2017 b; Yang et al. 2017), titanium silicalites (Kong et al. 2006; Feng et al. 2017; Du et al. 2017; Shen et al. 2015), and so on have been widely employed in ODS. Among all the reported catalysts, a metal oxide is an eye-catching one, which is especially true {{when it comes to}} <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide.</b> However, based on a previous report, stoichiometric <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> rarely shows excellent catalytic performance (He et al. 2017). For non-stoichiometric <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide,</b> because of the variable valences of W, the <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> can be readily reacted with an oxidant to form a reactive intermediate for the further oxidation process. Nevertheless, for <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> catalysts, bulk <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> rarely has satisfying catalytic performance because of the poor exposure of catalytically active sites. Thus, numerous strategies have been adopted to improve this situation. For example, our group employed graphene-like hexagonal boron nitride as a support for dispersion of <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> to prepare the WOx in nanoparticle form (Wu et al. 2015 b). However, such strategy is less universally applicable and involves high-temperature treatment. On the other hand, the poor catalytic activity of the bulk <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> in ODS has mainly originated from the strong hydrophilic property of <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide,</b> making the catalyst difficult to contact with the fuel oil.|$|R

HRTEM and SAED analyses showed that the synthesized <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> tapered needles have a single-crystalline structure with growth direction of [0 1 0]. The effects of the experimental conditions (the ratio between tungsten and hydrous nickel nitrate, the size of tungsten powders, and the reaction atmosphere) on the morphology of the products were systematically investigated. It was found that <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> nanowires, submicro-/ micro-whiskers and microtubules could be facilely obtained under different experimental conditions. The unique configuration and the single-crystal structure of the tapered needles may make them a potential candidate for field emitters and probing tips. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|Owing to the {{increasingly}} serious environmental issues {{caused by the}} sulfur burnt in fuel, desulfurization has become an important topic. In this work, an amphiphilic oxygen-defective <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> was synthesized by a colloidal chemistry method. The amphiphilic property and oxygen defects were well characterized, {{and the structure of}} the oxygen-defective <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> catalyst was investigated. In addition, the catalyst was employed in oxidative desulfurization system of fuel, and deep desulfurization was achieved. It was found that the very high oxidative desulfurization performance of oxygen-defective <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> catalyst resulted from both the amphiphilic property and oxygen defects. This work can provide a strategy for preparation of highly active metal oxide catalysts with oxygen defects in oxidative desulfurization reaction of fuel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A simple {{technique}} to synthesis crystalline <b>Tungsten</b> <b>Oxide</b> nanowires is presented. Using a standard thermal hotplate, a pure 99. 9 % tungsten foil is annealed to 484 ± 5 oC under ambient condition to generate vapor deposition of the heated materials {{on a piece}} of 150 µm thick glass cover slide pressing on the <b>tungsten</b> foil. <b>Tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> nanowires are found to deposit on the cover slide facing the heated tungsten foil. These <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxide</b> nanowires were characterized with SEM, TEM, EDX, micro-Raman and XRD. The crystalline nanowires were found to be straight and clean with a diameter of 10 - 300 nm and a length of a few tens of micrometers...|$|R

The intense NUV emission might be due to the localized states associated with oxygen vacancies and surface states.|$|R
