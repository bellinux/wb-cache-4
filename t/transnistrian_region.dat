25|$|On 21 October 1994, Russia and Moldova {{signed an}} {{agreement}} that committed Russia to {{the withdrawal of the}} troops in three years from the date of entry into force of the agreement; this did not come into effect, however, because the Russian Duma did not ratify it. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) included a paragraph about the removal of Russian troops from Moldova's territory and was introduced into the text of the OSCE Summit Declaration of Istanbul (1999) in which Russia had committed itself to pulling out its troops from Transnistria by the end of 2002. However, even after 2002, the Russian parliament did not ratify the Istanbul accords. On 19 July 2004, after it finally passed through parliament President Vladimir Putin signed the Law on the ratification of the CFE Treaty in Europe, which committed Russia to remove the heavy armaments limited by this Treaty. During 2000–2001, although the CFE Treaty was not fully ratified, to comply with it, Moscow withdrew 125 pieces of Treaty Limited Equipment (TLE) and 60 railway wagons containing ammunition from the <b>Transnistrian</b> <b>region</b> of Moldova. In 2002, Russia withdrew 3 military equipment trains (118 railway wagons) and 2 of ammunition (43 wagons) from the <b>Transnistrian</b> <b>region</b> of Moldova, and in 2003, 11 rail convoys transporting military equipment and 31 transporting ammunitions. According to the OSCE Mission to Moldova, of a total of 42,000 tons of ammunitions stored in Transnistria, 1,153 tons (3%) was transported back to Russia in 2001, 2,405 tons (6%) in 2002 and 16,573 tons (39%) in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Many {{that were}} to become active in the strike {{campaign}} had been suspicious of the language legislation from the beginning—they suspected {{this to be the}} first step towards “nationalization” of the republic at the expense of “their country,” the Soviet Union. However, on 10 August 1989 I. M. Zaslavskii, a deputy to the Moldavian Supreme Soviet and resident of the Transnistrian city of Tiraspol, leaked a new draft of the law to the factory newspaper of the “Tochlitmash” Tiraspol Machine-Building Factory im. Kirova. Seeing that the new version would establish Moldovan as the only official language of the MSSR, activists from a number of Tiraspol factories came together to create the United Work Collective Council (Ob"edinnennyi Sovet trudovykh kollektivov, OSTK) and called an immediate strike that eventually led to the shutdown of most major industrial activity (concentrated in the <b>Transnistrian</b> <b>region)</b> throughout the SSR.|$|E

2500|$|Nichita Smochină {{was born}} on the {{confines}} of historical Moldavia and Bessarabia: the entire <b>Transnistrian</b> <b>region</b> {{was at the time}} part of the Russian Kherson Governorate. As he himself later recounted, the bountiful eastern bank of the Dniester was home to a thriving Romanian community, or, as he put it, a veritable [...] "Romanian California". His later research traced the first Romanian presence in that area to the Dark Ages, revived by the Cossack Hetmanate's border policy, particularly in the 1650s. According to him, there were two main stages in the migration and resettlement of Moldavian peasants to what became his homeland. The first was under Moldavian Prince George Ducas (late 17th century); the second under Russian Empress Catherine the Great. Smochină spoke in detail about the Romanian colonies of 18th-century [...] "New Russia", that reached as far east as Oleksandriya.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is ongoing}} debate between the Moldovan {{authorities}} {{and the government of}} Transnistria on a design to be used on Transnistrian plates that is acceptable for Moldova also.

5000|$|Transnistria (Pridnestyrovie) is a {{strip of}} land running along Moldova's eastern border with Ukraine, named after the Nistru (Dniestr) river. The <b>Transnistrian</b> <b>region</b> is {{majority}} Slavic (Ukrainian and Russian) and russophone, {{in contrast with the}} rest of the country, and it was heavily industrialized during USSR rule. The Moldovan Declaration of Independence claims continuity of Moldovan sovereignty over the territory of Transnistria as it is [...] "a component part of the historical and ethnic territory of our people". However, the Moldovan Declaration of Independence is itself used as an argument against Moldovan sovereignty over Transnistria as it denounces the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement of 23 August 1939 between the government of the Soviet Union and the government of Germany [...] "null and void" [...] being the only formal union between the two territories.|$|E

The 'frozen conflict' between the Moldovan central state and the separatist <b>Transnistrian</b> <b>region</b> has caused 'soft' security problems in the EU's immediate neighbourhood and has increasingly engaged its attention. This article examines how the EU as a normative power can affect conflict transformation in Moldova. The theoretical framework that guides the analysis assumes that the EU can influence conflict transformation through the mechanisms of integration and association. The key argument is that the EU {{can have an impact}} on conflict transformation in the case of Moldova, but it does not use its full potential...|$|E
30|$|Following the Soviet Union’s {{collapse}} in 1991, Moldova and Georgia became independent countries {{and began a}} difficult transition to democracy and market economy that continues relatively unabated today. In both countries, the economy and living standards declined steadily, especially during the first decade following independence. At {{the turn of the}} century, approximately 71 % of Moldovans and 60 % of Georgians were living below the national poverty line (Vanore, 2015). A number of factors contributed to this decline, including political instability, the loss of subsidies and access to the markets of the Soviet era, hyperinflation and a dramatic drop in economic outputs of both countries. These problems were amplified by separatist movements and the outbreak of civil wars in the <b>Transnistrian</b> <b>region</b> of Moldova and in Abhazia and South Osetia regions of Georgia. Over the last two-and-a-half decades, active and passive forms of warfare have persisted and there is yet to be reconciliation between the separatist regions and central state authorities.|$|E
