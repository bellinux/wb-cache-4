5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small <b>town,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|Departing from Cape Henlopen, Delaware on February 17, 1776, {{the fleet}} {{arrived in the}} Bahamas on March 1, with the {{objective}} of seizing gunpowder and munitions known to be stored there. Two days later the marines came ashore seizing Fort Montagu at the eastern end of the Nassau harbor, but did not advance to the <b>town</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> gunpowder was stored. That night Nassau's governor had most of the gunpowder loaded aboard ships sailing for St. Augustine. On March 4, the Continental Marines advanced and took control of the poorly defended town.|$|E

In order to attend high school, she lived with her older sister in the neighboring <b>town,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> school was located, and then began to drive every day despite being only 14. She graduated from Stanberry High School in 1941, aged 16.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, the {{shipbuilding}} industry boomed in Ribeira, {{area around}} Póvoa Fortress in the sheltered bay, and {{one third of}} the population had some relation with this activity, building ships for the merchant navigation. During this period there was a relevant urban expansion: the Praça civic center with the town hall and the Madre Deus Chapel, the area of the old <b>town</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Main church was located and the fishermen neighborhood of Junqueira was starting its affirmation as a new urban center.|$|E
5|$|Roquebert's {{squadron}} sailed westwards towards Bourbon, initially {{planning to}} raid the eastern coast of island for food supplies, {{as his own}} were running low. Although the British garrison {{in the eastern part}} of the island was weak, the plan was thwarted by heavy surf on the landing beaches and Roquebert continued eastwards on half rations, reaching Tamatave in Madagascar on 19 May. The British garrison at Tamatave, 100 men of the 22nd Regiment of Foot, were afflicted with malaria and surrendered without contesting the <b>town,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> French squadron gathered water and food supplies.|$|E
5|$|The German graves {{were grouped}} {{according}} to military unit. Every grave in each grouping receiving a similar headstone, {{but not necessarily}} {{the same as that}} in other groupings. There were a number of organizations in Germany that were particularly opposed to mass-produced identical headstones and by consequence the cemetery contains a number of differently styled headstones. The German headstones were carved from locally quarried stone, principally bluestone and Belgian Petit Granit. German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank. The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or <b>town</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> regiment was based.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme {{and parts}} of Moss Side and Withington townships {{became part of the}} City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a county borough as did many larger Lancashire towns, and {{therefore}} not governed by Lancashire County Council. Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as Burnage, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Didsbury, Fallowfield, Levenshulme, Longsight, and Withington. In 1931, the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added. In 1974, by way of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. That year, Ringway, the <b>town</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Manchester Airport is located, was added to the City.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, M-69 {{started at}} the state line south of Crystal Falls. It ran north through Crystal Falls, where it intersected M-12, to end in Covington at an {{intersection}} with M-28. This roadway was redesignated {{with the creation of}} the U.S. Highway System in 1926. US2 replaced M-69 south and M-12 west of Crystal Falls. US102 replaced M-69 north of Crystal Falls, and the latter designation was reused on the section of M-12 east of <b>town.</b> <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> roadway intersected M-45 (now M-95) in Sagola, M-69 joined it to Randville and then replaced M-90 east to Foster City by 1927. By 1930, the highway was extended through Menominee County into Delta County to end at an intersection with US2/US41 east of Bark River. This extension gave M-69 its current routing.|$|E
5|$|MD 68 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 40 (Cumberland Street) {{in the town}} of Clear Spring. The state highway heads south as Mill Street through a commercial area. MD 68's name changes to Clear Spring Road after leaving the town limits. The state highway meets I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at a diamond interchange, then heads southeast through farmland, where the highway crosses Little Conococheague Creek. MD 68 intersects the eastern end of MD 56 (Big Pool Road) shortly before passing through the village of Pinesburg. The state highway intersects CSX's Lurgan Subdivision rail line and passes between industrial properties, then crosses Conococheague Creek and enters the town of Williamsport. MD 68 is municipally maintained within the <b>town,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> highway follows Conococheague Street south through an intersection with US 11 (Potomac Street). At this intersection, MD 63 joins MD 68 in a concurrency to continue through the Williamsport Historic District. The two highways leave the town limits at their diamond interchange with I-81 (Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway), through which the roadway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E

5|$|Within Shepton Mallet {{there are}} several {{distinct}} areas which originated as separate communities around the central point {{of the church and}} Market Place. The town centre is small, basically consisting of two streets: High Street, which runs south from the Market Place towards the Townsend Retail Park, and the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north from the Market Place to Waterloo Bridge. To the east, separated from the Market Place by the Academy complex, is the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. Lower Lane, which runs under Waterloo Bridge along the bottom of the river valley {{to the north of the}} town centre, is one of the few parts of the <b>town</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> River Sheppey runs above ground. At the eastern end is Leg Square, which is surrounded by three large houses originally built by owners of some of the town's mills. Very close by is Cornhill, on which the former prison stands.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Li Yuan's {{infantry}} began arriving, {{with the}} van division deploying {{in a square}} to fend off a Sui attack while the other two divisions were coming up behind it. Wen Daya's account now becomes sketchier, indicating that the infantry charged the Sui army, at which point Li Yuan's sons led the cavalry around the Sui flank towards the <b>town,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> small garrison left behind by Song Laosheng was forced to drop the portcullis gates. Li Yuan then let spread the rumour that Song Laosheng had been killed, which demoralized the Sui force. The Sui army began to retreat, but this turned into a rout when they found their retreat to Huoyi cut off by Li Yuan's cavalry and the barred gates. Wen Daya's narrative can be supplemented by the later account, which, despite its bias regarding Li Shimin, also contains indications that not everything went according to Li Yuan's plans: it appears {{that in the first}} clash between Li Yuan's infantry and the Sui army, the Sui had the upper hand and pushed Li Yuan back, possibly because he had not yet managed to bring all his forces into the field. Either through the arrival of the rest of Li Yuan's infantry, the actions of Li Yuan's cavalry along and behind the Sui flanks, or Li Yuan's stratagem, the Sui army's morale gave way abruptly, and their resistance collapsed.|$|E
