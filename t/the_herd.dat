5|$|Horses {{were first}} {{reported}} in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876, although the first horses had been brought into New Zealand in 1814. The feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases. Members of <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses, {{as well as being}} caught for their meat, hair and hides. <b>The</b> <b>herd</b> declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges, and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979. The Kaimanawa herd was protected by the New Zealand government in 1981, and there were 1,576 horses in <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> by 1994. A small, mostly unmanaged population also exists on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island. Roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size of <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> removing around 2,800 horses altogether. The Kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, and several studies have been conducted on <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> dynamics and habits of the breed.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{a working}} party was {{established}} {{to look at the}} management of the Kaimanawa herd. They aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management, to ensure that the treatment of horses is humane, to preserve and control the best attributes of the herds, and to eliminate the impacts of the herds on other conservation priorities. Goals included ensuring the welfare of the horses, protecting natural ecosystems and features that the Kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> at a sustainable level. Ecological objectives included ensuring that Kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered, rare and biogeographically significant plants; ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> does not further degrade the ecosystems in which it lives; and preventing <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> from spreading into the Kaimanawa Forest Park and the Tongariro National Park. Herd objectives included ensuring that the public was safe from roaming horses, while still allowing and improving public access to <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> and ensuring humane treatment of the horses; reducing conflict between <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> and other ecological values and land uses; and ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> is contained to a population that is tolerated by the ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in <b>the</b> <b>herd.</b> The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the wind is not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{studies have}} {{identified}} a few modern <b>herds,</b> <b>the</b> Sulphur Springs <b>herd,</b> <b>the</b> Cerbat <b>herd,</b> <b>the</b> Pryor Mountains <b>herd,</b> and <b>the</b> Kiger <b>herd</b> as retaining <b>the</b> original phenotype of horses brought to New World by the Spanish.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} of the railroads through Colorado and Kansas split <b>the</b> bison <b>herd</b> in two parts, <b>the</b> southern <b>herd</b> and <b>the</b> northern <b>herd.</b> <b>The</b> last refuge of <b>the</b> southern <b>herd</b> was in <b>the</b> Texas Panhandle.|$|R
50|$|The Aishihik and Kluane caribou <b>herds</b> migrate in <b>the</b> area {{surrounding}} Kluane and Aishihik Lakes. They are {{a northern}} mountain caribou, a distinct ecotype of the woodland caribou. In 2009 there were 181 caribou in <b>the</b> Kluane <b>herd</b> (also known as <b>the</b> Burwash <b>herd)</b> and 2044 caribou in <b>the</b> Aishihik <b>herd.</b> <b>The</b> Kluane <b>herd</b> was declining while <b>the</b> Aishihik <b>herd</b> was increasing.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, BLM {{said it would}} reduce <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> from its {{existing}} 195 adults to 120. The stated goal was to temporarily remove horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's conformity to type using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg, and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed.|$|E
5|$|BLM counts <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> {{visually}} {{about every}} four years by flying over the range, reporting on each animal found, and using statistical methods to correct for historic undercounting and other problems. In 1984, BLM set the maximum carrying capacity of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range at 121 adult animals, and revised this to 95 adult animals in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Canadian {{government}} {{protected the}} horses by law in their feral state. From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd {{studies have been}} performed, and in 2007 a genetic analysis was conducted that concluded <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists. In 2008, the horses were declared the official horse of Nova Scotia, and in 2011, the island was declared the Sable Island National Park Reserve. <b>The</b> <b>herd</b> is unmanaged, and legally protected from interference by humans. The horses live only at Sable Island and at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park on the mainland of Nova Scotia, with the latter herd descended from horses removed from Sable Island in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} a management plan for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members of <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E

5|$|No {{management}} {{action was}} taken until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when after years of flourishing population, the island's carrying capacity was exceeded.

5|$|The First World War {{slowed down}} {{the growth of}} the Limousin breed, which carried through the inter-war years despite a {{reorganisation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Herd</b> Book in 1923. Herd Book registrations grew slowly, from 600,000 animals in 1890 to 800,000 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin breed resumed {{its growth}} in the 1960s. The size of the French Limousin herd has {{increased}} sharply in recent years, with a 50% increase in numbers in France in 15 years. Today {{it is the second}} largest French beef breed, behind Charolais and ahead of Blonde d'Aquitaine. In 2004, of about 900,000 Limousin cows, 63,000 were recorded in <b>the</b> <b>Herd</b> Book. At that time, 20,000 bulls were used for breeding, 10% through artificial insemination, and 1,600 were recorded in <b>the</b> <b>Herd</b> Book. France's Limousin herd grew by 2.6% in 2014 to 2.69 million heads as of Dec. 31, including 1.09 million cows.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>herd</b> {{has been}} studied {{periodically}} since the late 1980s, with researchers recommending various management strategies depending on the focus of their study. Current herd levels {{have been shown to}} {{have a negative effect on}} their environment, and researchers focused on environmental issues recommend a severe reduction in herd numbers. Other researchers, looking at genetic variability, state that a herd size nearly as large as current is necessary to prevent inbreeding, but also state <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> is not genetically unique enough to warrant special preservation. The National Park Service has no current management plan for the horses, and their one effort to create one was blocked by Jack Kingston, a Georgia member of the US House of Representatives.|$|E
40|$|In this study, ten Nonvegian Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) pig herds (three nucleus {{and seven}} {{multiplying}} herds) were surveyed for Campylobacter spp. to detennine {{the occurrence of}} this organism in the Norwegian SPF pig health and breeding pyramid.

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} 1500 randomly selected dairy herds in Sweden, asking for general information about <b>the</b> <b>herds,</b> including routines from birth to first calving and also routines at breeding, calving and during the grazing period. Fifty-eight percent of the questionnaires were returned. The preweaned calves were kept in individual calf pens in 68 % and in group housing systems in 28 % of <b>the</b> <b>herds.</b> Pens with slatted floors were the main housing system for replacement heifers from weaning to breeding, and tie stalls from breeding to first calving. Whole milk was used in 44 % and milk replacements in 42 % of <b>the</b> <b>herds.</b> <b>The</b> calves received, as a median, 2. 5 litres of milk per meal and 2 meals per day. The median age at weaning was 8 weeks. Age was the single most common criteria used for deciding both weaning and breeding time. The median age when the heifers were first turned out to pasture was 6 months.

40|$|Cyathostomes {{were the}} {{predominant}} group of worms present in both herds. Trichostrongylus axei {{was seen in}} both herds, but Strongylus equinus, Strongylus vulgaris, Gyalocephalus capitatus, Poteriostomum spp. and Strongyloides westeri were only found in the feral horses. Larvae of Strongylus edentatus were found in a single domesticated horse. Fecal egg reduction tests with <b>the</b> domesticated <b>herd</b> showed a 32 % egg count reduction for fenbendazole, a 93 % reduction with pyrantel, and a 99 % reduction with ivermectin. From the LDA, anthelmintic resistance was evaluated by determining the resistance ratio of <b>the</b> domesticated <b>herd</b> compared with <b>the</b> feral <b>herd.</b> For benzimidazoles in <b>the</b> domesticated <b>herd,</b> 45 % of the cyathostome population was 9. 4 times more tolerant than <b>the</b> feral <b>herd's</b> parasite population. <b>The</b> parasite population in <b>the</b> domesticated <b>herd</b> was 1. 5 times more tolerant to Levamisole, and 1. 7 times more tolerant to the benzimidazole/levamisole combination than the parasite population within <b>the</b> feral <b>herd.</b> 9 % of the parasite population in <b>the</b> domesticated <b>herd</b> was 90 times more tolerant to avermectins than <b>the</b> feral <b>herd's</b> parasite population, even though a subpopulation of worms in <b>the</b> feral <b>herd</b> were tolerant to low concentrations of avermectins despite never being previously exposed to this class of anthelmintic...|$|R
5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed.

5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
