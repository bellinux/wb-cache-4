5|$|Argon is a {{chemical}} element with symbolAr and atomic number18. It is in group 18 of {{the periodic table}} and is a noble gas. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It is more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.|$|E
5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that the United States entered World War II in 1941, oil was a vital part of {{military}} operations around the world. The United States produced 60 percent of the world's crude oil, with the state of Texas in the south-west leading this production, producing more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> as much crude as any other state. The industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3,500 smaller operators.|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} that has 0.764 Jupiter masses and 1.827 Jupiter radii. In other words, {{it is about}} three-fourths as massive as Jupiter, but is {{slightly}} less <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> Jupiter's size. HAT-P-33b orbits its star at an average distance of 0.0503 AU, which is about 5% of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This orbit is completed every 3.474474 days (83.39 hours). HAT-P-33b has an equilibrium temperature of 1838 K, which is almost fifteen times hotter than the measured equilibrium temperature of Jupiter (124 K).|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 is a bright, blue B-type main {{sequence}} {{star in the}} Upper Scorpius association, a loose star cluster composed of stars with a common origin. The star {{is estimated to be}} approximately 2.5 times the mass of the Sun. Ages of the Upper Scorpius group have been quoted at 5 million years, however a more recent estimate suggests that the group is somewhat older (approximately 11 million years old). Its effective temperature is estimated at 10500 K, less <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> the effective temperature of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials is {{the vision}} of the International Raëlian Movement to {{establish}} an embassy, at a base cost of $20 million, with a landing pad that would serve as spaceport for extraterrestrial spaceships.

The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.|$|E
5|$|The {{approval}} of the tower was controversial due to the plot ratio concessions made by the Perth City Council to the developers. These concessions enabled the developers to construct a tower more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> the height which would otherwise be allowable on the site. There was also opposition to the Council's decision to ignore its own town planning experts in allowing a large car park to be constructed underneath the site.|$|E

5|$|The decade {{began with}} 25 million {{registered}} automobiles on the road, {{most of which}} predated World War II and were in poor condition; no automobiles or parts were produced during the war owing to rationing and restrictions. By 1950, most factories had made {{the transition to a}} consumer-based economy, and more than 8 million cars were produced that year alone. By 1958, there were more than 67 million cars registered in the United States, more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> the number {{at the start of the}} decade.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} of 1912 {{called for the}} election of a governor every two years. The term was increased to four years by a 1968 amendment. The constitution originally included no term limit, but an amendment passed in 1992 allows governors to succeed themselves only once; before this, four governors were elected more <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> in a row. Gubernatorial terms begin on the first Monday in the January following the election. Governors who have served the two term limit can run again after four years out of office.|$|E
