50|$|Vacuum MD {{contains}} an air gap channel configuration. Once it has {{passed through the}} membrane, the vapour is sucked out of the permeate channel and condenses outside the module as with SWGMD. VCMD and DWGMD can be applied for the separation of volatile substances from a watery solution or for the generation of pure water from concentrated salt water.One advantage of this method is that undissolved inert gasses blocking the membrane pores are sucked out by the vacuum, leaving a larger effective membrane surface active. Furthermore, a reduction of the boiling point results in a comparable amount of product at lower overall temperatures and lower temperature differences through the membrane.A lower required temperature difference leaves a lower total- and specific <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand.</b> However, the generation of a vacuum, which must be adjusted to the salt water temperature, requires complex technical equipment and is therefore a disadvantage to this method. The electrical energy demand is a lot higher as with DCMD and AGMD. An additional problem is the increase of the pH value due to the removal of CO2 from the feed water.|$|E

For this reason, a set of issues have been investigated, very different from one another but that allowed for a wider perspective on the various aspects {{to be taken into account}} for a suitable and integrated design and for their interaction. Every experience encountered plays a different and specific role in defining the key-points of an integrated design, i. e. reducing <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> for heating, cooling and lighting purposes by acting on the whole building; reducing primary energy consumption by adopting highly efficient building services; maximizing the use of renewable energy sources to cater for electricity and <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> demands; optimizing the energy performance of buildings by using automated control and regulation systems and by setting a suitable building management and maintenance program. More specifically, Section 2 deals with the role of passive solar systems in reducing <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> when different constraints (morphological, urban planning and architectural ones…) existed, for the energy retrofit of both existing and newly built constructions. In Section 3 simplified models for the analysis of heat generators, with specific reference to the two Methods defined by UNI TS 11300 - 2 technical standard are examined.

40|$|The {{energy demand}} {{in urban areas}} has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the last few}} decades because of the intensive urbanization that has taken place. Because of this, the European Union has introduced directives pertaining to the energy performance of buildings and has identified demand side management as a significant tool for the optimization of the energy demand. Demand side management, together with thermal energy storage and renewable energy technologies, have mainly been studied so far at a building scale. In order to study and define potential demand side management strategies at an urban scale, an integrated urban scale assessment needs to be conducted. DiDeProM, a model {{that can be used to}} generate detailed <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> profiles, at an urban district scale, has been developed in the current study. It is a bottom-up engineering model, based on samples of the representative building technique. A parametric analysis of the important variables of building energy performance at an urban scale has then been carried out. This has generated a database of normalized <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> profiles with an hourly time resolution. The final step of the process includes the generation of a detailed overall <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> profile at an urban district scale. DiDeProM was applied to a block of buildings in Turin (Italy) as a case study. After the calibration of the simulation model on real monitored data, a parametric analysis on 300 scenarios for a reference building was conducted, generating a database of seasonal thermal heating energy demand profiles with hourly time steps.

Thus the potential access to low-cost heat supply could drive farmer's choices towards more profitable crops even if with stringent cultivation requirements. In this paper a techno-economic assessment is proposed to evaluate the competitiveness of local sustainable biomass supply pathways to serve greenhouses heat demand and thus propose alternative and more profitable cultivation options to farmers. In the first part of the paper the biomass supply chain is assessed, investigating a number of Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) cultivars, on field chipping, logistics of transport and seasonal storage, in order to derive wood chips supply cost at the premises of a greenhouse.

In this paper, the main transport phenomena in membrane distillation are analyzed theoretically. One of the main limiting factors is the molecular diffusion resistance caused by stagnant air in the membrane pore volume.

Preliminary experiments on water deaeration using a commercial membrane contactor were carried out.

The experimental investigations are focused on identifying the transient temperature performance, effective mode of heat transfer, accumulative <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> discharge and mean discharge power of paraffin in LHS unit. Moreover, the influences of operating conditions such as inlet temperature and volume flow rate of heat transfer fluid (HTF) on thermal behaviour of LHS unit are experimentally studied. The transient temperature profiles and photographic characterisation of liquid-solid transition of paraffin in LHS unit provide {{a good understanding of}} temperature distribution and dominant mode of heat transfer. It is noticed that during discharging cycles, natural convection has an insignificant impact on thermal performance of LHS unit. However, due to inclusion of extended longitudinal fins, conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer. It is noticed that due to development of solidified paraffin around tubes and longitudinal fins, the overall thermal resistance is increased and thus, discharging rate is affected. However, by regulating inlet temperature or volume flow rate of HTF, the influence of overall thermal resistance is minimised. Mean discharge power is enhanced by 36. 05 % as the inlet temperature is reduced from 15 oC to 5 oC. Likewise, the mean discharge power is improved by 49. 75 % as the volume flow rate is increased from 1. 5 l/min to 3 l/min.

The <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of the swimming pool was 1438 kWh per day (78 % heating the pool and 22 % providing hot water for showers), owing to temperate climate in the city of Toluca in central Mexico; a mean annual temperature of 13. 5 °C (10. 5 °C in January and 15. 7 °C in June) offers a large potential of renewable thermal energy stored in the atmosphere. Its utilization in heat pumps driven by thermal combustion engines can provide energy below 60 °C; this temperature level provides hot water for showers while a lower temperature level of about 40 °C heats up the pool water and swimming hall. Depending on outdoor temperature, which defines the load for the units, the efficiency in terms of total primary energy consumption is better for the CHP solution (100 % and 80 % load) and is better for the heat pump {{in the case of a}} 57 % load. The energy losses for the CHP unit on-site are equivalent to half the losses caused by extraction and distribution of natural gas under current circumstances in Mexico. The results provide a decision tool...|$|E
40|$|The ammonia-water {{absorption}} {{refrigeration system}} is attracting increasing research interests, since {{the system can}} be powered by waste <b>thermal</b> <b>energy,</b> thus reducing <b>demand</b> on electricity supply. The development of this technology demands reliable and effective system simulations. In this work, a thermodynamic simulation of the cycle is carried out to investigate the effects of different operating variables {{on the performance of}} the cycle. A computer program in C language is written for the performance analysis of the cycle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Non-Aqueous Solvent (NAS) CO 2 Capture Process {{is being}} {{developed}} as an advanced, next-generation post-combustion capture technology for CO 2 removal from power generation and industrial flue gas streams. The core of the NAS process has been {{the development of a}} family of CO 2 -selective NASs that have the potential to substantially reduce the <b>thermal</b> regeneration <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> associated with solvent regeneration to ∼ 2, 000 kJt/kg of CO 2 captured. This paper discusses our rationale for selecting a NAS platform and provides results from the physical and thermodynamic characterization of the NASs, lab-scale testing results, and an update on our efforts to address specific process design challenges related to NAS processes for evaluation of the NAS CO 2 capture process at the (large) bench-scale...|$|R
40|$|This thesis work {{intends to}} {{investigate}} the variation in the energy use {{of the building and}} the IA temperature difference while using Phase change material (PCM) on different building components. The software used for simulation of the defined model is WUFI Plus: program allows inputting various data (different geometry of model, calculations can be done on various climate condition and different design condition of building assembly and inner load). The PCM applied for simulation is DuPont Energain that consists of paraffin wax. The use of PCM in a design helps to stabilize IA temperature and keep it constant along the day profile for creating more comfortable <b>thermal</b> environment. <b>Energy</b> <b>demand</b> is another important aspect in building design that is largely effected by the design condition and the parameters of component chosen for the model. This thesis prioritizes the IA temperature and <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> factors and uses WUFI Plus to simulate a standardized building model and checks the effect of PCM application on these factors. </p...|$|R
