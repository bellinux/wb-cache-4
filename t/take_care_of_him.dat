Jim anonymously reports Anya and when she is deported, Dot hides Tomas from the authorities, vowing to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Dot and Jim struggle {{to look after the}} baby and, after talking to the local vicar and her old friend Dr. Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), Dot decides to hand him over to social services.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Ava and Andy {{are alone}} together, she lets the Acheri demon into the building, {{and uses a}} new ability to command it to kill him. After {{revealing}} to Sam that she has actually been in the town all the months she has been missing, killing off other psychic children that Azazel has sent there, she sets the Acheri demon on him. However, Jake sneaks up behind her and uses his superhuman strength to break her neck, prompting the now free Acheri demon to flee. As Sam and Jake then start to leave the town, Jake attacks him out of distrust, but Sam gains the upper hand and apparently knocks him unconscious. However, as Sam is distracted by an arriving Dean and Bobby, Jake regains consciousness and fatally stabs him. Dean assures his brother that he will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> but Sam dies in his arms.|$|E
5|$|The detectives {{are shocked}} {{at the lack of}} homicide-related calls they are {{receiving}} throughout the night. Bolander (Ned Beatty) tries several times throughout the night to call Medical Examiner Blythe (Wendy Hughes) and ask her out on a date, but he cannot build up the courage. With encouragement from Howard (Melissa Leo), he finally asks Blythe out and is shocked when she accepts. Crosetti (Jon Polito) gets agitated when his daughter calls and wants her boyfriend to sleep over. Gee comforts Crosetti and lets him go home to take care of her. Gee finds a baby boy in a small animal carrier-like cage on the bottom floor of the police department. The baby is very popular with the detectives, who <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> while they wait for social services to arrive. After the social services worker takes the baby, the cleaning lady Loretta Kenyatta (N'Bushe Wright) hysterically screams somebody kidnapped her baby. The detectives get the baby back for her while Bayliss, infatuated with Loretta, listens to her talk about her life.|$|E

25|$|Miss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby, {{played by}} Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts, {{are the other}} two {{permanent}} residents. Seemingly inseparable, these sweet-natured, dotty spinsters appear to have taken a fancy to Basil, feeling {{that they need to}} <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> In response, Basil vacillates between superficial charm and blunt rudeness during his conversations with them.|$|E

The tribe went on to lose the next challenge and upon leaving, Mariano informed van den Berghe that he would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> if he took care of Brkich. Van den Berghe, Huang, and Vavrick-O'Brien voted out Manthey in hopes that Mariano would keep his word.|$|E

25|$|Ba Zaw {{lived on}} for almost ten more years, {{struggling}} to paint but mentally impaired. Nyan Shein offers a sad {{picture of him}} in his last years, visiting artists, clutching a book by J. J. Hilder in his hands. It is said that during these last years, he lived with Saya Saung and that two of his other students, Saya Mya and Hein Soon, also helped to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Nyan Shein gives Ba Zaw’s date of death as 1943, but Amar claims that her husband found Ba Zaw’s obituary in the newspaper and that he died on 11 December 1942.|$|E
25|$|In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus, Oedipus {{becomes a}} wanderer, pursued by Creon and his men. He finally finds refuge at the holy {{wilderness}} right outside Athens, {{where it is}} said that Theseus took care of Oedipus and his daughter, Antigone. Creon eventually catches up to Oedipus. He asks Oedipus to come back from Colonus to bless his son, Eteocles. Angry that his son did not love him enough to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> he curses both Eteocles and his brother, condemning them both to kill each other in battle. Oedipus dies a peaceful death; his grave is said to be sacred to the gods.|$|E

25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Huntingdon, Helen's abusive and {{alcoholic}} husband, is a Byronic {{figure of}} great fascination {{but also of}} barely concealed moral failings. His abusive behaviour impels Helen {{to run away from}} him, but nevertheless when he becomes ill (after falling from his horse when drunk and injuring his leg badly), Helen returns to Grassdale to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Unwilling to stop drinking alcohol, Huntingdon deteriorates in health and eventually dies. He is widely thought to be loosely based on the author's brother, Branwell, but some critics have argued that, apart from their masses of red hair, they have little in common. Along with Lord Lowborough, Huntingdon bears far stronger resemblance to two types of drunkards outlined in Robert Macnish's The Anatomy of Drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|James Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie McClair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) {{have been}} best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, {{he is also}} boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of {{the events in the}} series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more {{sensible}} and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, but he knows Cook and Freddie will always <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.|$|E
5000|$|His {{encounter}} with the young Gouri is fortuitous because it is she who <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and helps [...] "hunt" [...] birds. She helps him through a barren wilderness, takes <b>him</b> home and <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> When he is made to change his clothes because otherwise the [...] "birds will know" [...] and fly away is probably {{an important part of}} his transformation from a strict, conformist and aging man to one of a person more open to the stimuli of his environment.|$|R

25|$|Emily is {{donating}} eggs to pay {{for school}} and loses her eggs when the clinic encounters a minor shutdown of its freezers; Aria gets burned by a fire caused by a malfunction at Hanna's bridal shower; and Alison falls {{down a flight of}} stairs. The girls build a plan of attack, which offers Hanna as bait. After Ali sees what appears to be her dead mother and Detective Wilden, she starts to question her sanity and checks herself into the same hospital Charlotte attended. Spencer, Toby and Mona work together to catch Sara, but instead they find old medical records for a woman named Mary Drake, and {{she was the one who}} gave birth to Charles while a patient at the Radley (now a hotel managed by Ashley Marin) 25 years ago, the DiLaurentis family adopted Charles as she was unable to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hagrid {{is absent}} {{during the first}} part of the fifth novel. The {{character}} later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.|$|E

Years later he developed Parkinson's disease, prostate cancer, {{and other health}} issues; they eventually divorced, [...] "but not for the usual reasons", says writer Jeff Spevak.

500|$|In Manadhai Thirudivittai (2001), Valayapathi (Vivek) {{pretends to}} have lost both his hands. His lover then {{promises}} to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The song [...] "Kanne Kalaimane" [...] is heard as the background music for the scene. In a comedy scene from Run (2002), Mohan (Vivek) imitates Haasan's mannerisms from the climax scene in Moondram Pirai to make his friend Shiva (R. Madhavan) recognise him but fails. In a similar scene from the Malayalam film Kochi Rajavu (2005), Harisree Ashokan's character uses the same mannerisms to make Dileep's character recognise him.|$|E
500|$|... "Circle the Drain" [...] is a rant song where, lyrically, Perry {{is telling}} off a self-destructive drug-addicted ex-boyfriend. Its candid lyrics also discuss the strains his {{addiction}} put {{on both of}} them. In the track's chorus, she sings about how {{she wants to be}} his lover, not someone who has to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> such as a maternal figure. She also sings about how he had ultimately lost large opportunities. Styled in the genres of disco-rock, and gothic rock tones, it is an up-tempo song that lasts for fourminutes and 32 seconds, and also has influences of techno. The track is composed in the key of E minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5.|$|E
500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
