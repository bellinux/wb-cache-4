5|$|County cricket fully resumed in 1946. Hutton was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> his injury; {{his wrists}} no longer rotated fully and he {{abandoned}} the hook shot. Nevertheless, he scored 1,552 runs {{at an average}} of 48.50, and was recognised by Wisden as Yorkshire's most effective batsman as the county won their fourth consecutive championship title. His four centuries included 183 not out against the touring Indian team, but he was less successful in the three Tests, scoring 123 runs {{at an average of}} 30.75. England won the series 1–0 but Hutton's only fifty was a defensive innings in the second Test, when he was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> a bad back. He was omitted from the Gentlemen and Players match, but was part of the MCC team touring party for the 1946–47 tour of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Ed Stelmach succeeded Klein as premier, {{following}} his win {{of the leadership}} of the Alberta Progressive Conservative party in 2006. He won the 2008 provincial election, but, <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> dissension within his party, resigned as the party celebrated its 40 years in power in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Salvatore uses Drizzt to {{represent}} issues of racial prejudice, particularly in The Dark Elf Trilogy. For instance, Drizzt {{is concerned that}} if he and his love Cattie-Brie (a human) have children, their offspring will face hostility from both races. Drizzt is also <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> the lifespan discrepancy between himself and Cattie-Brie.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Australia {{purchased}} 12 Westland Sea King Mk 50s as the Royal Australian Navy's new ASW helicopter; the Sea Kings {{replaced the}} aircraft carrier 's complement of Westland Wessex HAS31 in the following year. Early operations were <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> a series of accidents. Between October 1975 to May 1979, four aircraft were lost in accidents, the primary causes were the loss of oil from the main gearbox.|$|E
5|$|Lang's {{region of}} Stepney within the Diocese of London {{extended}} {{over the whole}} area generally known as London's East End, with two million people in more than 200parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> the squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{ended the}} {{first-class}} tour with 1,922 runs at 71.18, despite being <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> a {{split between the}} first and second fingers of his left hand caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation, which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.|$|E
5|$|The Priory of Sion myth {{has been}} exhaustively debunked by journalists and {{scholars}} {{as one of}} the great hoaxes of the 20th century. Some skeptics have expressed concern that the proliferation and popularity of books, websites and films inspired by this hoax have contributed to the subject of conspiracy theories, pseudohistory and other confusions becoming more mainstream. Others are <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> the romantic reactionary ideology unwittingly promoted in these works.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E

5|$|Einstein was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact}} that his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{spent the}} week before the match in the spa town of Buxton, and {{travelled}} to Dorking {{on the eve of the}} match. Manchester City spent the week in Bushey. Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to be fit enough to play. Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> a leg injury. Dunn was passed fit well before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in four of their five previous cup ties.|$|E
5|$|From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Garza, <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> {{what he had}} done, {{confessed to}} the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder. He cooperated with the police to incriminate Martínez, who then aided in Cisneros' arrest. Cisneros and Garza were eventually {{sentenced to life in}} prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|He was {{selected}} for the 1953 tour of England, and scored 76 against Tasmania before the tourists departed. Despite making only 35 runs at 7.00 in the lead-up matches, Tallon {{was selected}} for the First Test at Trent Bridge, his first match at the top level {{in more than two}} years. He took two catches and scored a duck and 15. Hassett and his deputy Arthur Morris then made the decision to replace Tallon with Langley. Still <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> stomach ulcers, Tallon played in another eight first-class matches for the tour, scoring 119 runs at 19.83. His most notable effort was an unbeaten 83 in an innings win over Kent. He was unable to regain his Test position.|$|E
5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son, Bogdan III the One-Eyed (15041517) whose reign was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> {{a long series}} of {{military}} conflicts with Poland and Wallachia. The good relations with Poland were reestablished under the reign of Stephen IV the Younger (15171527). His successor, Peter IV Rareş (15271538, 15411546) intervened in the struggle for the crown of the Kingdom of Hungary: on the order of the sultan, in 1529 he invaded the Székely Land and defeated the army of Ferdinand I's partisans.|$|E

5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's {{identity}} crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, against Leicestershire, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, {{promoting}} Keith Miller ahead of himself to No. 3. As Miller {{came out to}} bat, the large crowd mobbed the players' entrance only to see that Bradman was not batting in his customary position. Bradman came to the crease at 2/157, and after initially being <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> the left-arm unorthodox spin of Australian expatriate Jack Walsh, added 159 with Miller before falling for 81. Australia compiled 448 and bowled out the home side for 130 and 147 to win by an innings, with Bradman taking one catch.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. At the other end, Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
