5|$|Designed {{for future}} {{expansion}} to accommodate additional aircraft, {{there has been}} talk of a terminal expansion, though official plans {{have yet to be}} announced. However, with the gate space being used to 100 percent capacity at peak times, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> capacity available for new flights unless they arrive and depart at off-peak times (10 AM-12 PM),(7 PM-10 PM).|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> {{evidence}} of prehistoric {{activity in the}} area, especially pre-Iron Age; however, Celtic names {{in the area around}} Wigan—such as Bryn, Makerfield and Ince—indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the Iron Age. The first people believed to have settled in the Wigan area were the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe who controlled most of northern Britain.|$|E

5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he still}} {{preferred}} Arabic authors more than Persian ones. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> evidence which shows {{his interest in}} Persian poetry. He spoke Arabic, wrote in Arabic and was {{proud to be a}} student of a famous Arab grammarian. He studied science in Arabic, including astronomy and mathematics. Many books written in Arabic were dedicated to him whether religious or secular content. Apparently showing interest in Arabic rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a provincial town where culture was dominated by Arabic and Persian.|$|E
5|$|Language and {{personal}} names provide some difficulties. The former {{is an important}} indicator of culture but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> direct evidence for its use in specific circumstances during the period under consideration. Pictish, Middle Irish and Old Norse would certainly have been spoken and Woolf (2007) suggests that a significant degree of linguistic balkanisation took place. As a result, single individuals often appear in sources {{under a variety of}} different names.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> {{geographic}} {{variation in}} size. The main differences are {{the presence or}} absence of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> {{information}} as {{to the effects of}} Pauline on Mexico, but during the passage of the hurricane over Magdalena Bay, a boat disappeared with its five occupants. Despite a large-scale search for the boat or any possible remnants, no trace was ever found. The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may have been responsible for a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> obvious {{landscape}} evidence remaining of {{the previous}} mining activities around Clutton, Temple Cloud, High Littleton and Timsbury. However {{there is a very}} large Batch almost in the middle of Camerton that is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. The Batch was bare, like the Paulton ones until, according to locals, the wife of the owner of Camerton Court decided to pay for it to be planted with trees to improve the view. There are small batches at Clutton, east of Radford Hill and at Greyfields, High Littleton.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> voice {{acting in}} the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, {{then there is a}} large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Many Scottish names {{occur in}} Otago and Southland (the Lammerlaws, Invercargill, Wedderburn, Glenfalloch) and Scottish {{settlers}} also named Riccarton and the Avon River in Christchurch. Canterbury has an English flavour to its nomenclature with Christchurch and Oxford, but also contains Belfast and French names throughout the Akaroa area. Scandinavian migrants left their {{mark in the}} Seventy Mile Bush with Dannevirke and Norsewood {{and some of the}} suburbs and streets of Auckland and Wellington reflect Australian immigration (Footscray and Botany Downs). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> Asian influence in New Zealand place naming, with Khandallah in Wellington and Cashmere (Kashmir) in Christchurch, reflecting British imperial connections rather than Indian influence.|$|E
5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form {{a more or less}} continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E
