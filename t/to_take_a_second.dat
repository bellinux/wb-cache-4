5|$|As Peter and Lois {{are having}} sex, she yells out George Clooney's name, so Peter realizes {{that she is}} imagining him as Clooney to {{maintain}} her libido. Lois and Peter decide <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> honeymoon to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian {{to take care of}} their children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which a school staff member catches Chris in the boys' restroom with vodka that belongs to his classmate Jake Tucker. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father Tom refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting cocaine in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to community service.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{was still}} {{attached}} to her old friend when Mary Dudley left the court in July 1579because of bad health, or out of solidarity with her brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, who was in disgrace for having married. She joined her husband at Ludlow in 1582, where he was serving his third turn as President of the Council of Wales. A year later her health {{was in such a}} state that Henry Sidney believed he would soon have the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> wife. Mary Dudley died on 9August 1586, three months after her husband, in whose elaborate funeral she had participated. She was buried by his side at Penshurst.|$|E
5|$|Sing's marksmanship at Gallipoli saw him dubbed 'The Assassin' or 'The Murderer' by his comrades. He {{reportedly}} {{acquired the}} latter nickname {{due to his}} callous attitude towards the enemy. By early September 1915, he had taken 119 kills, according to Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, commanding officer of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Regimental records list Sing as having taken 150 confirmed kills, but on 23 October 1915, General William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC forces, issued an order complimenting him on his 201 unconfirmed kills. Historian Bob Courtney noted that an official kill was recorded only if the spotter saw the target fall. If the first shot missed the target, it was very risky <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> shot, as this could give away the sniper team's position.|$|E

5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria {{was riding}} in a {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was {{riding in a}} carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.|$|E

Other countries, such as Iran and Pakistan, require that a man get permission <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> wife from his first wife, and then show the court proof of his first wife's consent. Finally, countries such as Malaysia state that a man must get permission from both his wife and from the governmental religious authority in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{the flag}} went up, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal had just {{landed on the}} beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Colonel Johnson, the battalion's commander, {{believed}} that the flag belonged to the 2nd Battalion 28th Marines, who had captured that section of the island. Johnson sent Pfc. Rene Gagnon, a messenger for E Company, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> larger flag up the volcano to replace the first flag. It was as the replacement flag attached to another heavy pipe went up that Rosenthal took Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.|$|E
25|$|A Super Over eventuated, and Nitschke was {{not used}} as Australia made 2/6 from their over. She was called upon to bowl Australia's over. On the third ball of the over, Claire Taylor was run out by Jess Cameron while trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> run and England were at 1/5 after five balls. Beth Morgan hit Nitschke away and {{attempted}} to runs to take England to seven runs and a victory, but was not fast enough for Cameron's throw and was run out, tying the scores once again. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the match—Cameron scored the solitary six.|$|E

25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> look at him, and he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E
25|$|As the {{professional}} for Blackpool, {{he was able}} to earn more money than any first class cricketer anywhere in the world. Each League side in Lancashire was permitted to pay only one professional. During the 1950s and early 1960s, in the summer at any one time there were more than 150,000 holidaymakers in Blackpool, and there were very large crowds indeed paying at the turnstiles of Blackpool Cricket Club. Every season, moreover, the Blackpool pro was given a benefit match. Illustrating the value of the Blackpool job, Alley was succeeded as Blackpool's pro by many of the all-time greats of the game. These included Sir Conrad Hunte, Garfield Sobers, Pankaj Roy, Hanif Mohammad and Rohan Kanhai. Playing only 2 days a week would also have given the pro the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> job if he had so wanted, including playing for a Minor County or a first class County Second Eleven.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Nowak would not claim insanity if her case ever went to trial. Nowak's attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case. On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak's attorneys <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper-sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak's attorneys as to the factual basis for it. If it was found not to have occurred, Nowak's attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery to be dropped before trial begins. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to lesser charges. She was sentenced to a year's probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.|$|E

500|$|Over time, Roddenberry {{sought to}} earn more money for his family.

He was turned down, but found another way to earn money. The Dragnet radio series and 1951 television series sourced their stories from the LAPD, and Roddenberry gathered stories from his colleagues on the force and wrote them up for submission to the show, splitting the $100 payment evenly if they sold. This extra income was substantial for the time, as he earned only $400 a month from the Department. The Roddenberry's second child, Dawn Allison, was born on August 31, 1953.|$|E
