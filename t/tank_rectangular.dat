50|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} strongly {{influences the}} directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles {{in a highly}} adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of partially-filled tank vehicles. Anti-slosh devices such as baffles are widely used in order to limit the adverse liquid slosh effect on directional performance and stability of the tank vehicles. Since most of the time, tankers are carrying dangerous liquid contents such as ammonia, gasoline and fuel oils; therefore stability of partially-filled liquid cargo vehicles is very important. Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical <b>tank,</b> <b>rectangular,</b> modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.|$|E

Experiment were carried out with an objective to find the shape effect on oxygen transfer coefficient k under {{a wide range of}} dynamic condition (variable X-the parameter governing power per unit volume) for <b>rectangular</b> <b>tanks.</b> An identical rotor with six flat blades was used in all the three tanks. The geometric dimensions, which were developed to produce maximum aeration in square tanks by a previous study,were used in the present study. Results have confirmed that at lower values of X (X< 0. 8) non dimensional oxygen transfer coefficient (k) is maximum in square <b>tanks</b> followed by <b>rectangular</b> <b>tank</b> of L/B= 2 and it is the least in <b>rectangular</b> <b>tank</b> of L/B= 1. 5. However the <b>rectangular</b> <b>tank</b> of L/B= 1. 5 produces always lower k values for any given rotor speed when compared to square tank, whereas the performance of <b>rectangular</b> <b>tank</b> of L/B= 2 is slightly better than square tanks when rotor speeds are higher...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{aeration}} {{experiments were}} conducted in tanks of length to width ratio (L/W) of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2 and circular tanks to study their relative performance on oxygen transfer and energy consumption while re-aerating deoxygenated water. An identical geometric similarity of various linear dimensions of aerators, rotor blades and rotor diameter was maintained for all sizes and shapes of aeration tanks tested. Power consumed per unit volume concept to simulate the oxygen transfer coefficient k {{is found to be}} valid in all the three shapes of aerators. Simulation equations to predict the oxygen transfer coefficient k for any given dynamic parameter governing the theoretical power per unit volume, X were developed for rectangular tanks of L/W ratios equal to 1. 5 and 2. Results were compared with simulation equations (correlating k and X) for square and circular tanks. Simulation criterion correlating the oxygen transfer coefficient k with actual and effective power consumption per unit volume for three shapes of tanks was developed in this paper. Energy consumption per unit volume of water was also analyzed. Examples illustrating the application of results are presented. It has been found that the circular tanks are the most energy efficient i. e., to produce maximum k for a given effective / actual input energy, followed by square <b>tank,</b> <b>rectangular</b> tank of L/W = 1. 5 and rectangular tank of L/W = 2. This suggests that the circular tank gives a better performance as far as power requirements is concerned and hence better economy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design {{considerations}} of surface aeration tanks on two basic issues of oxygen transfer coefficient and power requirements for the surface aeration system. Earlier developed simulation equations for simulating the oxygen transfer coefficient with theoretical power per unit volume have been verified by conducting experiments in geometrically similar but differently shaped and sized square <b>tanks,</b> <b>rectangular</b> <b>tanks</b> of length to width ratio (L/W) of 1. 5 and 2 as well as circular tanks. Based on the experimental investigations, new simulation criteria to simulate actual power per unit volume have been proposed. Based on such design considerations, it has been demonstrated that it is economical (in terms of energy saving) to use smaller tanks rather than using a bigger tank to aerate the same volume of water for any shape of tanks.

40|$|The {{superior}} hydrodynamics of circular <b>tanks</b> over <b>rectangular</b> <b>tanks</b> {{are well}} known by aquaculturists; yet <b>rectangular</b> <b>tanks</b> are still widely used because of their easier handling. As a consequence, several {{studies have focused on}} the hydrodynamics of <b>rectangular</b> <b>tanks,</b> where rotating flow cells are generated by injecting water tangentially to the tank wall with the outlet placed {{in the center of the}} cell. In the present work, we evaluate the hydrodynamics in a <b>rectangular</b> <b>tank</b> with 4 rotating flow cells of 1 m diameter, which is called multivortex tank. We also analyze baffle placement between two consecutive water inlets and the characteristics of the water inlet (flow rate and inlet velocity), which then allows us to determine the average velocities and the distribution uniformity of these velocities. The obtained results are compared with a circular tank having the same cell diameter and inlet configurations as the multivortex tank. Baffle placement between two consecutive water inlets in the multivortex tank helps increase the average velocity, the uniformity of velocities and the symmetry in the rotating flow cells. In configurations without baffles, the combination of low flow rate and high impulse force present the lowest symmetry. Differences between intermediate and extreme cells were observed. In all configurations tested, velocities and uniformities were higher in extreme cells than in intermediate cells. In the circular tank the average velocities achieved were higher than in the multivortex tank with the same impulse force, but the uniformity of velocities were higher in the multivortex tank. Finally, the proportionality between the average velocity and the square root of the impulse force for a specific tank geometry has been corroborated in commercial scale models.
