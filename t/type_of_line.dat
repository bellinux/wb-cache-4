2500|$|The {{surveying}} of any regional area, {{such as a}} {{state or}} two, is a multi-step process. First, two controlling survey lines are established: a baseline, which runs east-west and a principal meridian, which runs north-south (Fig. 1). [...] The locations of the two are determined by a previously chosen initial point, where they originate and thus intersect. [...] Next, at a defined distance interval, commonly 24 or [...] depending on the year and location, standard parallels of latitude are established parallel to the baseline. [...] The meridian, baseline and standard parallels thus established form a lattice upon which all further surveying is then based. [...] Subsequent work divides the land into survey townships of roughly 36 square miles (~93km2) or 6 miles (~9.7km) on each side. This {{is done by the}} establishment of township and range lines. Township lines run parallel to the baseline (east-west), while range lines are true meridians and thus run north-south; each are established at six mile (10km) intervals. [...] Lastly, townships are subdivided into 36 sections of approximately one square mile (640 acres, ~2.6km2) and sections into four quarter-sections of 0.25 square mile (160 acres, ~0.65km2) each. [...] (See [...] ). The intersection of a township line (or baseline) with a range line (or principal meridian) constitutes a township corner, of a section line with any other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> a section corner, and a point halfway between any two section corners a quarter corner. [...] The federal government typically surveyed only to this quarter-section level, the subdivision of smaller parcels being carried out subsequently by private surveyors after original sale.|$|E

50|$|In geometry, an edge is a {{particular}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> segment joining two vertices in a polygon, polyhedron, or higher-dimensional polytope. In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary, and is often called a side. In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two faces meet. A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal.|$|E

Digital Signal Designation is the classification of digital bit rates in the digital multiplex hierarchy used in transport of telephone signals from one location to another. DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a framing bit (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit, transmitted over a digital circuit called T1. T1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|E
