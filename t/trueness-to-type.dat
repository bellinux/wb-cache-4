40|$|Objectives: 1) To develop {{protocols}} for {{in vitro}} propagation of bramble (blackberry and raspberry) cultivars {{grown in the}} southeastern U. S. 2) To maintain virus-indexed in-vitro Nuclear Stock plants of selected bramble cultivars and advanced breeding selections in the repository in the Micropropagation Unit (MPU) at NCSU. 3) To evaluate micropropagated and virus-indexed bramble plants for <b>trueness-to-type.</b> Justification: Raspberries are potentially a very high-value crop, {{but they are also}} one of the most difficult crops to grow in North Carolina and the Southeastern U. S. In North Carolina, commercial raspberry production is concentrated in the western part of the state, in the mountains and in the foothills. Raspberries are not commonly grown in the piedmont and coastal plain areas because most raspberry cultivars are poorly suited to warm temperatures in those areas. New raspberry cultivars that are better adapted to th...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Before {{cryopreservation}} {{is routinely}} used, {{its effect on}} the <b>trueness-to-type</b> of the regenerated plant material needs to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we studied the effect of seed cryopreservation on the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of wild Solanum lycopersicum Mill. plants. METHODS: Thirty-five morphological traits of plants regenerated from cryopreserved seeds were compared to those measured on plants regenerated from non-cryopreserved seeds. RESULT: No statistically significant differences were observed between cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved samples, either in the first or in the second generation post-liquid nitrogen exposure. However, at the molecular level, the genetic analyses performed on the second generation plants germinated from control and cryopreserved seeds using 14 nuclear Simple Sequences Repeats (SSR) markers uncovered some changes in microsatellite length between control and cryopreserved samples. These results confirm at the botanical phenotype level the effectiveness of seed cryostorage for conservation and regeneration of true-to-type S. lycopersicum plants. CONCLUSION: Further experiments are required to clarify potential phenotypic effects of the changes observed in the DNA...|$|E
40|$|Apple cultivars and {{breeding}} lines that represent {{much of the}} diversity currently present in major European breeding programmes and are genetically related by their pedigree were examined for the trueness of their identity and parentage by consistency in marker scores using a genome-covering set of 80 microsatellite (SSR) markers and an ‘identity-by-descent’ approach. One hundred and twenty-five individuals were validated for the <b>trueness-to-type</b> of both their parents and 49 were validated for one of their parents, their second being unknown (23 individuals) or not available in this study (26 individuals). In addition, 15 individuals for which we lacked one of or both the direct parents were validated by consistency with tested parents of earlier generations. Furthermore, the identity of 28 founder cultivars was validated, their marker scores being consistent with descending cultivars {{and breeding}} lines. Four of the eight triploids identified were clearly shown to have arisen from unreduced egg cells. The assumed pedigree of 15 further individuals {{was found to be}} incorrect; fully consistent pedigrees were suggested for three of the cultivars. The pedigrees of a further eight individuals were confirmed through inference from the molecular dat...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} information relevant to the use and development of rootstocks from temperate fruit trees (particularly apple, pear and cherry) as an effective means of enhancing harvest index (e. g. weight of useable fruit yield relative to total plant weight). The intention is to provide information to facilitate exploration and discussion of which scientific approach(es) might best suit the future development of cocoa growing. The grafting of clonal scions onto rootstocks is an ancient practice initiated to obviate problems associated with not being able to obtain <b>trueness-to-type</b> from seedlings and limitations in the ability to root scions directly for vegetative propagation. Subsequently, it became apparent that many features of the scion could be beneficially influenced. In particular, these included increases in harvest index, precocity (reducing the period of the juvenile phase), yield (productivity), fruit size and quality, tolerance to climatic stress, pest and disease resistance, as well as the ability to control tree size (dwarfing). Direct rootstock advantages, such as increased anchorage and improved uptake of water and nutrients may also improve the harvest index. Crops can also be grown at higher densities and this can increase production per unit land area...|$|E

In {{the context of the}} comparative analysis, twenty-four synonyms/counterparts and the putative parents for twelve Balkan accessions were identified. We discovered five pairs of homonyms, subsequently confirming the identity or parentage of three of them. Some of the examined accessions were identified either {{on the basis of the}} genotypes found in the literature, or through parentage relationships revealed in this study. For the remaining fifty accessions we were unable to establish either their pedigree or to identify them on the basis of SSR profiles available elsewhere. Finally, the Balkan genotypes that were not well classified by synonymy or parentage analysis were further studied with a Principal Coordinate Analysis to reveal genetic clustering within larger datasets of genotypes. The graphical display of the individual and group distances showed that about forty accessions (85 %) are structured within a group of Balkan and Eastern Europe genotypes and only a minor proportion resulted in admixed population assignment...|$|E
40|$|Summary <b>Trueness-to-type</b> and agronomic {{characteristics}} of trees of four coffee (Coffea arabica L.) F 1 hybrid clones de-rived from embryogenic cell suspensions {{were compared with}} those of trees produced from in vitro microcuttings. Three types of variants were observed among the 644 trees derived from embryogenic suspensions. Total frequency of the variants was 2. 1 % for trees originating from embryogenic cell suspen-sions, whereas no variant was found among the trees produced from microcuttings. The variant known as “thick leaf ” had thick leaves, many abnormally starry flowers and low yields of large fruit. The “dwarf ” variant was characterized by slow growth and small fruit. The “dwarf peaberry ” variant had ab-normal seeds in a single cavity, in addition to the “thick leaf” and “dwarf ” characteristics. Compared with normal trees, the variants differed in leaf density and number of chloroplasts per guard cell. The variants aside, there were no differences in the main agronomic characteristics between trees produced from embryogenic suspensions and those produced from microcuttings. For all four clones, the trees had vegetative characteristics, productivity, fertility, and bean biochemical, mineral and organoleptic characteristics that were identical to those of the controls. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} generate coffee trees commercially with normal agronomic perfor-mance from embryogenic suspensions, because the frequency with which somaclonal variants occur is limited...|$|E
40|$|Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} crops in the world, but has been often plagued by encountering new parasites that still represent a major constraint, such as downy (DM) and powdery (PM) mildew. Nowadays, growers are still obliged to recur to a massive use of pesticides to prevent serious yield loss. In consequence, the research applied to breeding for resistance and the deployment of new resistant grapevine varieties are strongly encouraged as a step towards sustainable agriculture. In this study, we focus on the genetic characterization of numerous Vitis hybrids, donors of resistance to DM and/or PM, in order to identify selection signatures. In particular, 86 hybrids of European origin and of 100 American hybrids, along with 30 related V. vinifera varieties, have been genotyped at 70 SSR loci. Based on the SSR profiles, the historical pedigree information has been checked and, following the <b>trueness-to-type</b> validation for most of the studied hybrids, the Identity By Descent (IBD) analysis has been performed, tracing the allelic flow through the successive generations. Here we report preliminary results about the identification of non-vinifera genomic intervals retained into the vinifera background. Subsequently, the genotyping analysis will be extended to the other 12 chromosomes (120 SSRs) and possibly to new crucial genotypes. The final result of this study will be the release of molecular markers valuable for grapevine Marker-Assisted Breeding (MAB) approach, upon their validation in ad hoc segregating populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{molecular}} markers {{are available}} for many economically important traits in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) {{as well as in}} other fruit crops. Unfortunately, lack of knowledge of the allelic variation of the related genes hampers their full exploitation in commercial breeding programs. These markers have usually been identified in a single cross. Consequently, only one or two favourable alleles of the related quantitative trait loci (QTL) are identified and exploitable for markerassisted breeding (MAB), whereas a breeding program may include several alleles. Our novel employed approach, namely pedigree-based analysis (PBA), allows for the identification and exploitation of most alleles present in an ongoing breeding program. This is achieved by including breeding material itself in QTL detection, thus covering multiple generations and linking many crosses through their common ancestors in the pedigree. In this study we focus on the genetic characterization of numerous Vitis hybrids, donors of resistance to downy and/or powdery mildew, in order to identify selection signatures. In particular, 120 hybrids of American origin and 100 European hybrids, along with 44 related V. Vinifera cultivars, have been genotyped at 190 SSR loci. These markers have been chosen based on their physical distance in order to have 10 SSRs well-scattered along each chromosome. Based on the SSR profiles, the historical pedigree records have been verified. Following the <b>trueness-to-type</b> validation for most of the studied hybrids, the identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis has been performed, tracing the allelic flow through the successive generations. Here we report results about the identification of non-vinifera genomic intervals retained into the vinifera background and the anchoring of the discovered breeding signatures to the grapevine genome. In addition, we report on the PBAbased QTL results for segregating populations coming from pedigree-supported parental genotypes donors of resistance to downy mildew in north-eastern Italy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Apples {{and sweet}} {{cherries}} are generally characterized by self-incompatibility, which {{is controlled by}} the multiallelic locus S with gametophytic action. Thus the identification of S-genotype represents crucial information for fruit breeders and growers. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the S-genotype of two apple (‘Čačanska Pozna’ and ‘Čadel’) and two sweet cherry (‘Asenova Rana’ and ‘Čarna’) cultivars developed at Fruit Research Institute, Čačak using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with consensus and allele-specific primers. The S-genotype of apple cultivars ‘Čačanska Pozna’ (S 7 S 9) and ‘Čadel’ (S 2 S 7) were consistent with parental combinations ‘Starking Delicious’ (S 9 S 28) × ‘Jonathan’ (S 7 S 9) and ‘Golden Delicious’ (S 2 S 3) × ‘Jonathan’ (S 7 S 9), respectively. For sweet cherry cultivars ‘Asenova Rana’ [‘Drogans Gelbe’ (S 1 S 5) × ‘Majova Rana’ (S 1 S 4) ] and ‘Čarna’ [‘Majova Rana’ (S 1 S 4) × ‘Bigarreau de Schrecken’ (S 1 S 3) ], S 3 S 9 and S 1 S 4 were identified respectively, suggesting that the reported pedigree is erroneous. The <b>trueness-to-type</b> of DNA samples of both sweet cherry cultivars was confirmed by comparison of cultivar samples from more than one site. Upon this testing, the remaining inconsistency indicated that aforementioned parentages of the sweet cherry cultivars were incorrect. These discrepancies could be the result of possible pollen contamination, or mistakes either in breeders recording or in seed processing and seedling production. The results of S-genotyping of apple and sweet cherry cultivars provide relevant information on correct assignment of these cultivars to cross-compatibility groups, which are important for cross design in developing new cultivar, as well as for orchard management in the efficient production of fruits.

40|$|From 2006 through 2015, a {{research}} project on Durable Resistance in potato against Phytophthora (DuRPh) was carried out at Wageningen University and Research Centre. Its objective {{was to develop a}} proof of principle for durable resistance against late blight by cisgenesis. This public-funded project aimed at stimulating research on genetic modification and public debate on innovative genetic techniques. It was decided to clone and transfer late blight resistance (R) genes of crossable wild potato species (cisgenes) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation without non-potato genes. A stack of multiple R genes were planned to be inserted into established varieties, thereby creating a dynamic variety in which the composition of the stacks may vary over space and time. Cisgenic plants were selected based on the expression of all inserted R genes and <b>trueness-to-type.</b> Within the project, 13 R genes from wild potato species were genetically mapped and three of them were cloned. Four varieties were transformed with one to three R genes. This was initially done using kanamycin resistance provided by a selectable marker gene of synthetic origin in order to quickly test the performance and stability of the introduced R genes and stacked R gene combinations. Once the functioning thereof was confirmed, marker-free transformations were conducted; thus, true cisgenic events were selected. The results about the different R genes, their chromosomal location, their specificity, the background dependence, the maximum size of a stack, its regeneration time and associated somaclonal variation frequency and its stability were studied. After selection and characterisation in the laboratory, the best cisgenic events were assessed in field trials for late blight resistance. This showed that inserted R genes were capable of turning a susceptible variety into a resistant one. Maximising longevity of the resistance was assured through resistance management research. It was shown that stacking of multiple R genes and monitoring how to deploy these stacks spatially and temporally could reduce fungicide use by over 80 %. Communications through media and field demonstrations were manifold to allow public and policymakers to decide if cisgenesis is an acceptable tool to make potato farming more sustainable. Future deployment of the DuRPh strategy will depend largely on its status as a genetically modified crop or its exemption thereof. Worldwide near eradication of late blight would increase global annual potato production by close to 80 million tons, thereby contributing considerably to the needed additional global future food supply. </p...|$|E
40|$|Somaclonal {{variation}} (SV) is a {{major concern}} in all micropropagation systems. It is described as the phenotypic variation displayed in in vitro-derived regenerants and it is believed to be originated from a large array of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Highly productive Coffea arabica hybrids are clonally disseminated in Meso-American region through somatic embryogenesis (SE). The objective of the present work in coffee is to evaluate the <b>trueness-to-type</b> of SE, to understand better the mechanisms involved in SV and further optimize SE conditions. We assessed the variations in the propagated plants at the phenotypic, cytogenetic (chromosome counting), genetic (mutations/AFLP, activation of transposable elements/S-SAP) and epigenetic (methylation/MSAP) level by using two complementary approaches. First, with 2 hybrids we studied industrial culture conditions expected to be weakly mutagenic thanks to the combined use of short term proliferation period (6 months) and low auxin supply (0 - 1. 4 μM 2, 4 -D). Two proliferation systems i. e. secondary embryogenesis and embryogenic suspensions were compared, the latter being more productive and economic. AFLP and MSAP molecular analyses on 145 somatic seedlings showed that genetic and epigenetic polymorphisms between mother plants and emblings were extremely low, i. e. ranges of 0 – 0. 003 % and 0. 07 – 0. 18 % respectively, with {{no significant difference between the}} proliferation systems. No plant was found to cumulate more than 3 methylation polymorphisms. For the two hybrids tested, massive phenotypic observations in nursery and field plots showed very low levels of SV (0. 9 % from 800, 000 plants). Cytological analysis showed abnormal chromosome numbers (41 - 43, 45) in most of coffee somaclonal variants and normal numbers (44) in phenotypically normal plants. Stressful experimental conditions were also applied by using extended proliferation periods (4, 12 and 27 months) for three independent embryogenic lines established for the Caturra var. in presence of high growth regulator concentrations (4. 5 μM 2, 4 -D, 17. 8 μM 6 -BA) to understand the mechanisms of culture ageing on SV. The proliferation time strongly affected the SV frequency among the 180 regenerated plants and in a highly similar way with the three embryogenic lines. No variant was found after 4 months proliferation although 30 % and 94 % phenotypic variants were observed in plants derived from 12 and 27 month-old cultures, respectively. Regardless the culture age and the embryogenic line, no polymorphisms were found in the 124 plants analyzed neither with AFLP nor with S-SAP using 13 different transposable elements from several families, and very limited polymorphisms were found in the methylation patterns using MSAP markers (0. 049 - 0. 087 %). However, similarly to plants derived from under industrial conditions, phenotypic variants systematically showed abnormal chromosome numbers and normal plants systematically showed normal numbers. This work showed that SE based on embryogenic suspensions is reliable for true-to-type propagation of selected C. arabica varieties. It also demonstrated the importance of culture age on SV and hence the non random nature of this phenomenon. The genetic and epigenetic alterations are particularly limited during SE. The main change in most of phenotypic variants was aneuploidy showing that mitotic aberrations play a major role in SV in coffee. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from July 7, 2016 - January 7, 2017 Hazelnut {{is one of the}} most important nuts in worldwide production and the European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is the most economically important of the 11 recognized hazelnut species. Development of new cultivars is continuous, with emphasis on better nut quality, high yield and disease resistance. Hazelnuts are highly heterozygous, and clonally propagated. Traditional propagation methods in hazelnut are not rapid enough to provide the required nursery stock for newly released hazelnut cultivars, but micropropagation can provide rapid production of hazelnut planting stock. Several growth media are available for specific cultivars, but many are not suitable for the wide range of germplasm used in new cultivars. Micropropagation of hazelnuts remains challenging due to the various responses of diverse genotypes to in vitro growth. Several studies incrimentally improved the growth medium, but determining exact nutrient requirements was difficult. The aim of this study was to determine which statistical methods would make the growth medium optimization process more practical and to develop an optimal micropropagation medium for diverse hazelnuts by testing salts and ions as factors within the experimental design. In addition an SSR fingerprinting set suitable for a diverse group of hazelnuts was developed. The first study was designed to test the effect of salts on three hazelnut genotypes and compare two methods of data analysis. Driver and Kuniyuki Walnut medium (DKW) macro-salts (NH₄NO₃, Ca(NO₃) ₂∙ 4 H₂O, CaCl₂∙ 2 H₂O, MgSO₄∙ 7 H₂O, KH₂PO₄ and K₂SO₄) were varied from 0. 5 × to 3 × DKW concentrations with 42 combinations in a IV-optimal design. Shoot quality, shoot length, multiplication and callus formation were rated and analyzed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) data mining algorithm. Both analyses indicated that NH₄NO₃ was a predominant nutrient factor. RSM results were genotype dependent while CHAID included genotype as a factor in the analysis, allowing development of a common medium rather than several genotype-specific media. Overall, CHAID results were more specific and easier to interpret than RSM graphs. The optimal growth medium for diverse hazelnut genotypes was formulated as: 0. 5 × NH₄NO₃, 3 × KH₂PO₄, 1. 5 × Ca(NO₃) ₂ and and the rest of the macro salts set at 1 × DKW with modified minor nutrients [4 × H₃BO₃, 4 × Na₂MoO₄∙ 2 H₂O, 4 × Zn(NO₃) ₂∙ 6 H₂O, 0. 5 × MnSO₄∙H₂O, 0. 5 × CuSO₄∙ 5 H₂O]. The second study was to determine the effects of ions on tissue culture medium optimization. NH₄⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, SO₄²⁻ and PO₄³⁻ ions were used as factors in a D-optimal design. K⁺ and NO₃⁻ ions were used to bring the pH level to neutral, and as factors in the statistical analysis. The CHAID data mining algorithm was used to analyze shoot growth responses of three hazelnut genotypes. The algorithm trees revealed significant variables and their interactions, and provided exact cut-off amounts for each of the ions for the related growth response by incorporating genotype as an independent factor. The critical cut-off values for good shoot quality, elongation, multiplication and medium callus formation were suggested to be: NO₃⁻ 5 mM and K⁺ < 46 mM. Another step of the research was to develop a reliable and economical fingerprinting set consisting of high core-repeat SSRs (≥ 3) for genotype identification of 102 hazelnut accessions. Identification of <b>trueness-to-type</b> by phenotypic observation is very difficult and labeling mistakes during the several steps of micropropagation can result in costly errors. The use of SSRs for plant identification is preferred over other molecular markers because they are reproducible across laboratories, exhibit co-dominant inheritance, have a large number of alleles per locus and are randomly distributed throughout the genome. Twenty SSRs containing repeat motifs of three or more nucleotides distributed throughout the hazelnut genome were screened on eight genetically diverse cultivars to assess polymorphism, allele size range, and ease of scoring. Six SSRs were discarded after genotyping 96 hazelnut samples, either due to large allele bin widths and/or alleles that do not match the motifs, complicating allele scoring. Fourteen polymorphic, easy-to-score SSRs with non-overlapping alleles were selected and amplified in a single multiplex. The multiplexed set generated the same alleles that were obtained when amplifying each SSR individually in the eight test accessions. SSR primer concentrations were then optimized to generate a clear signal for each locus. This 14 -SSR fingerprinting set was used to genotype 102 hazelnut accessions, and distinguished unique accessions mainly according to parentage and in some cases based on geographic origin. As a result of these studies, salt- and ion-based optimized tissue culture medium formulations were developed for diverse hazelnuts. The importance of salts and ions as factors within the experimental design and analysis was examined, and using salts as factors results in complexity within the design as the effects of ions can not be determined. Although salt optimization studies are still a powerful tool, and are experimentally easier, optimization at the ionic level provided a clearer evaluation of the ion-based growth responses, because the plants take up minerals as ions of the corresponding salts. Data mining (CHAID) was used to make the tissue culture optimization process more practical compared to analysis with the standard ANOVA, regression and RSM. CHAID delineated specific concentrations that were effective and allowed easier analysis of nutrient content for an improved medium. A reliable and cost-effective multiplexed fingerprinting set of 14 SSR markers was developed for confirming identity and paternity in diverse hazelnut cultivars and species and 102 accessions were fingerprinted...|$|E
