5|$|The silver medals {{from the}} 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to run, {{and he took}} a more serious, more mature stance towards his career. Bolt {{continued}} to develop in the 100 m, and he entered to run in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s. This was the second-fastest legal performance {{in the history of the}} event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy. Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, praising Bolt's form and technique especially. Michael Johnson, who was observing the race, said that he was shocked at how quickly he had improved over the 100 m distance. The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to come.|$|E
5|$|Reyes and Doggett {{arrive in}} Novi {{and talk to}} Detective Van Allen (James McDonnell), who seems apathetic about the case. At the same time, Scully {{contacts}} Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several bodies in the 1960s that were skinned {{in a manner similar}} to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not pay much attention to the cases, emphasizing <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than one victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local butchery to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is skinned. In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died.|$|E

25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would be very hard for the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Kovari's {{previous}} roommate, John Pape, {{reported being}} very suspicious <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to his friend's death than the Police were letting on. He searched {{on the internet}} for other unexplained deaths in the Barking area, and found information about the unexplained death of Port's first victim, Anthony Walgate, furthering his suspicions that Kovari's death was not accidental. He was astonished at the similarities of the cases, especially the locations in which the bodies were found, however Dagenham Police did not link the two cases nor did they issue any warnings to the LGBT community.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{establishing}} Strategic Marine in 2001, Mark was the Executive Director of Geraldton Boat Builders (GBB) and {{his experiences in}} that business convinced him <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> opportunity for a business like Strategic Marine in Asia as opposed to Australia, provided the company had its own, more cost-effective shipyards overseas. In 2005 a Singapore shipyard was acquired and is developing the reputation of delivering vessels well ahead of schedule. The company also has a Vietnam shipyard, with over 1000 staff working to a full order book, including a $62 million contract for the Western Australian Government.|$|E

25|$|The Coliseum {{was also}} home to the USFL's Los Angeles Express between 1983 and 1985. In this capacity, the stadium also {{is the site of}} the longest {{professional}} American football game in history; a triple-overtime game on June 30, 1984 (a few weeks {{before the start of the}} 1984 Summer Olympics) between the Express and the Michigan Panthers, which was decided on a 24-yard game-winning touchdown by Mel Gray of the Express, 3:33 into the third overtime to give Los Angeles a 27–21 win. Until 2012, this game marked the only time in the history of pro football <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than one kickoff in overtime play in the same game.|$|E
25|$|Straight {{from his}} University years, Max {{was chosen to}} travel on the Corinthians tour of Brazil {{in the summer of}} 1913. Managing the tour's first goal, against Rio de Janeiro, he also scored against Paulistano and made quite a name for himself. In 1914, he again set sail with the Corinthians for Brazil...however this tour was {{cancelled}} when still at sea, the side discovered War had been declared at home. At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to life than just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-Boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of these}} closures, {{a steady stream}} of bands were {{beginning}} to develop considerable profiles. Alchemist, who had formed in Canberra in 1987, had finally refined its unique style that comprised elements of death metal, grindcore, surf rock and psychedelia. A track from their second album Lunasphere had been included on one of the 3 Hours of Power compilations and the group played at the 1996 Sydney Big Day Out. In Sydney, the symphonic black metal band Lord Kaos were filling the gap that had been left by the dissolution of Bestial Warlust, and a core group of bands like Mortality, Cryogenic and Segression were proving <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to the local scene than just death metal. Death metal was the focus of Brisbane's scene, however, headed by Misery who had formed in 1992 and featuring others like Sakkuth and Killengod. A developing melodic metal/power metal scene led by Hyperion but also including groups like Apparition, Pegazus, Vanishing Point and Eyefear were starting to appear in the always diverse Melbourne. In Perth, isolation was a serious problem. Both Allegiance and iNFeCTeD, a death metal band that had released two albums on Shock, had self-destructed not long after returning from expensive east coast tours.|$|E

500|$|Keith Ross Miller, [...] (28 November 1919 – 11 October 2004) was an Australian test cricketer and a Royal Australian Air Force pilot during World War II. Miller {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as Australia's greatest ever all-rounder. Because of his ability, irreverent manner and good looks he was a crowd favourite. English journalist Ian Wooldridge called Miller [...] "the golden boy" [...] of cricket, leading to his being nicknamed [...] "Nugget". He [...] "was more than a cricketer... he embodied the idea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to life than cricket".|$|E

He felt that an upside to the downshifting was the [...] "return to characters", and thought that there was no better representation of character than Hurley. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad wrote that although he heard [...] "that this episode would be mostly filler", he did not [...] "think that's true". He liked the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> revelations of Hurley's background, and enjoyed the [...] "awesome reveals from the other half of downed Oceanic 815". TelevisionWithoutPity.com graded the episode with a [...] "B-".|$|E
500|$|During the concepting {{stages of}} Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, the {{developers}} considered replacing the character {{with either a}} new Force wielder or a previous named Star Wars character. However, they decided to keep Starkiller as the player character as they were fond of and were attached to him and felt <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> story that he could supply and they could build a franchise around him. Blackman commented that after deciding how to have Starkiller return, he felt [...] "it all made sense and fell into place". Developers tried to make The Force Unleashed more personal to Starkiller, with the game focusing on Starkiller's search for the truth of his identity.|$|E
500|$|Divine Intervention is {{the sixth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on September 27, 1994, through American Recordings, {{it was their}} first album to feature Paul Bostaph, {{replacing}} the band's original drummer Dave Lombardo. The production posed {{a challenge to the}} record company, as its marketing situation drew arguments over the album's explicitness. The band used the Decade of Aggression live album to give them time to decide the album's style. Since it was released nearly four years after Seasons in the Abyss, vocalist Tom Araya said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> time spent on production compared to the band's previous albums. The cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter as a re-imaging of the group's early [...] "Slayergram" [...] graphic.|$|E

In an interview with USA Weekend in 2002, Robinson stated that her success was down to an intensive training regime which allowed her to maintain her focus. She noted in 1993 that individuals searched more for her weaknesses rather than strengths, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> pressure placed upon her because of her gender. Robinson stated that although she {{did not try to}} overpower her male rivals, her career was not [...] "a crusade for feminism". Although Robinson holds a number of [...] "firsts" [...] for women in American motorsports, she said that they do not hold a large significance for her.|$|E
500|$|The {{beginning}} of set theory as {{a branch of}} mathematics is often marked by the publication of Cantor's 1874 paper, [...] "Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen" [...] ("On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers"). This paper {{was the first to}} provide a rigorous proof <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than one kind of infinity. Previously, all infinite collections had been implicitly assumed to be equinumerous (that is, of [...] "the same size" [...] or having the same number of elements). Cantor proved that the collection of real numbers and the collection of positive integers are not equinumerous. In other words, the real numbers are not countable. His proof differs from diagonal argument that he gave in 1891. Cantor's article also contains a new method of constructing transcendental numbers. Transcendental numbers were first constructed by Joseph Liouville in 1844.|$|E
500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez writes that, {{although}} the brevity of each selection allowed little opportunity for progression beyond a basic motif, [...] "sonically, the range explored {{even within the}} Western cues was astonishing". He adds: [...] "The Indian cuts too were quite varied stylistically, showing open-minded listeners <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to the country's music than twanging sitars and thumping tablas." [...] Simon Leng considers Wonderwall Music to be [...] "a companion in spirit" [...] to Bill Evans' Conversations with Myself (1963), due to the doubling of the lead instrument {{in some of the}} Indian pieces; he comments on the significance of Harrison recording in India in January 1968: [...] "There were now three Beatles who held firm artistic visions. The group was unraveling in earnest." [...] Leng praises [...] "Dream Scene" [...] in particular, describing it as a [...] "musical acid trip" [...] that [...] "rivals anything on Sgt. Pepper for sheer freak-out effect".|$|E
