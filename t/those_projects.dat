We report here that this difference in luminance contrast gain between M and P cells is maintained at low levels of mean retinal illumination.

FUNDAPAT has reached to extend coverage of potable water to 105,000 persons in 104 communities, in particular in the metropolitan area of Tegucigalpa.

25|$|One of the AWC's final {{projects}} was {{the funding}} of a worker training center. Since its inception, the corporation had required that 51 percent of each developer's workforce come from the District of Columbia, and that at least 10 percent of the workforce be residents of the city's impoverished Ward 8. But developers complained that few D.C. residents were prepared or trained for the jobs offered. The AWC established an employment organization to help screen D.C. residents who applied for jobs, better match residents to positions that they qualified for, and improve residents' job skills to better prepare them for the workplace. The organization would also help promote awareness of AWC redevelopment projects and job opportunities at <b>those</b> <b>projects</b> among Ward 7 and Ward 8 residents. This organization, known as the Business Resource Center, opened at 2311 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE on April 11, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The LB {{was formed}} {{at the same}} time as the {{bursting}} of the railway mania investment bubble, and so it found raising capital for expansion extremely difficult during the first years of its operation, other than to complete <b>those</b> <b>projects</b> that were already in hand. The L had experienced difficult relations with the SER where the companies shared facilities, notably Redhill and Hastings and on the approaches to London Bridge) In October 1849 the SER acquired the new Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG) line, which the LB regarded as a major incursion into its territory. However, the LB had one important playing card not available to the L – control of the SER main line between New Cross and Croydon. In 1849 the LB appointed a new and capable chairman, Samuel Laing, who negotiated a formal agreement with the SER that would resolve their difficulties for the time being and would define the territories of the two railways. Under this agreement the LB would have free access to London Bridge, Bricklayers' Arms station and goods yard, and Hastings. The SER would have free use of the New Cross to Croydon line, and receive revenues from passengers at intermediate stations, but would not make or work competing lines to Brighton, Horsham, Chichester or Portsmouth. Laing also approved a modest degree of expansion, most notably the acquisition of a branch line from the main line at Three Bridges to the market town of East Grinstead in July 1855.|$|E
500|$|When Menem {{began his}} presidency, there was massive {{hyperinflation}} and a recession. Most economists {{of the time}} thought that the ideal solution was the Washington Consensus: reduce expenditures below {{the amount of money}} earned by the state, and open [...] international commerce to free trade. Alfonsín had proposed similar plans in the past, alongside some privatization; but <b>those</b> <b>projects</b> were resisted by the PJ. The plan was resisted by factions benefiting from the protectionist policies, but the magnitude of the crisis convinced most politicians to change their minds. Menem, fearing that the crisis might force him to resign as well, embraced the Washington Consensus and rejected the traditional policies of Peronism. He invited the conservative politicians Álvaro Alsogaray and María Julia Alsogaray into his cabinet, as well as businessmen from Bunge and Born.|$|E

Although they had enjoyed working on <b>those</b> <b>projects,</b> Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to [...] "something original". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the nine to 14 year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator {{on their way back}} to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, [...] "Kim Possible. She can do anything", to which Schooley responded, [...] "Ron Stoppable, he can’t", and nearly the entire premise of Kim Possible naturally unfolded thereafter. According to Schooley and McCorkle, both lead characters' names indicate that Kim Possible [...] "is going to be an arched show that is a little bit over the top, but also that the girl {{is going to be the}} action lead and the guy is going to be funny." [...] Conceiving all main characters themselves, Rufus and Wade were eventually created and added to the roster, but the series essentially remains about Kim [...] "who is incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world" [...] while [...] "Ron would be challenged everywhere." ...|$|E
