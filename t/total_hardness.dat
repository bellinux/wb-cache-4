2500|$|Coal-fired boilers / {{power plants}} when using coal or lignite rich in {{limestone}} produces ash containing calcium oxide (CaO). CaO readily dissolves in water to form slaked lime / Ca(OH)2 and carried by rain water to rivers / irrigation {{water from the}} ash dump areas. Lime softening process precipitates Ca and Mg ions / removes temporary hardness {{in the water and}} also converts sodium bicarbonates in river water into sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate (washing soda) further reacts with the remaining Ca and Mg in the water to remove / precipitate the <b>total</b> <b>hardness.</b> Also water-soluble sodium salts present in the ash enhance the sodium content in water further. Thus river water is converted into soft water by eliminating Ca and Mg ions and enhancing Na ions by coal-fired boilers. Soft water application in [...] irrigation (surface or ground water) converts the fertile soils into alkaline sodic soils. River water alkalinity and sodicity due to accumulation of salts in the remaining water after meeting various transpiration and evaporation losses, become acute when many coal-fired boilers and power stations are installed in a river basin. River water sodicity affects downstream cultivated river basins located in China, India, Egypt, Pakistan, west Asia, [...] Australia, western US, etc.|$|E

50|$|A catalyzed {{endpoint}} {{procedure to}} determine trace amounts of metal ions in solution (down to approximately 10 mg/L) employs 0.01 mol/L EDTA. This {{has been applied}} to the determination of low level Cu(II) in specialized plating baths, and to the determination of <b>total</b> <b>hardness</b> in water. The reaction enthalpies of EDTA with most metal ions are often quite low, and typically titrant concentrations around 1 mol/L are employed with commensurately high amounts of titrand in order to obtain sharp, reproducible endpoints. Using a catalytically indicated endpoint, very low EDTA titrant concentrations can be used. A back-titration is used. An excess of EDTA solution is added. The excess of EDTA is back-titrated with a suitable metal ion such as Mn2+ or Cu2+. At the endpoint, the first excess of metal ion catalyzes a strongly exothermic reaction between a polyhdric phenol (such as resorcinol) and hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
