5000|$|A thioamide (rarely, thionamide, {{but also}} known as thiourylenes) is a {{functional}} group with the general structure R-CS-NR′R″, where R, R′, and R″ are organic groups. They are analogous to amides but they exhibit greater multiple bond character along the C-N bond, resulting in a larger rotational barrier.

50|$|The reagent used {{can be any}} {{substance}} that gives S2&minus; ions in such solutions; most commonly used are hydrogen sulfide (at 0.2-0.3 M), <b>thioacetamide</b> (at 0.3-0.6 M).

Its purpose is to keep the sulfide ion concentration at a required minimum, so as to allow the precipitation of 2nd group cations alone. If dilute acid is not used, the early precipitation of 3rd group cations (if present in solution) may occur, thus leading to misleading results. Acids beside HCl are rarely used. Sulfuric acid may lead to the precipitation of the 5th group cations, whereas nitric acid oxidises the sulfide ion in the reagent, forming colloidal sulfur.|$|E
40|$|Information on {{bacterial}} thioamide metabolism {{has focused}} on transformation of the antituberculosis drug ethionamide and related compounds by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To study this metabolism more generally, a bacterium that grew using <b>thioacetamide</b> as the sole nitrogen source was isolated via enrichment culture. The bacterium was identified as Ralstonia pickettii and designated strain TA. Cells grown on <b>thioacetamide</b> also transformed other thioamide compounds. Transformation of the thioamides tested was dependent on oxygen. During thioamide degradation, sulfur was detected in the medium at the oxidation level of sulfite, further suggesting an oxygenase mechanism. R. pickettii TA did not grow on thiobenzamide as a nitrogen source, but resting cells converted thiobenzamide to benzamide, with thiobenzamide S-oxide and benzonitrile detected as intermediates. <b>Thioacetamide</b> S-oxide was detected as an intermediate during <b>thioacetamide</b> degradation, but the only accumulating metabolite of <b>thioacetamide</b> was identified as 3, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazole, a compound shown to derive from spontaneous reaction of <b>thioacetamide</b> and oxygenated <b>thioacetamide</b> species. This dead-end metabolite accounted for only ca. 12 % of the metabolized <b>thioacetamide.</b> Neither acetonitrile nor acetamide was detected during <b>thioacetamide</b> degradation, but R. pickettii grew on both compounds as nitrogen and carbon sources.

The activities of ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase in the livers were decreased by <b>thioacetamide</b> treatment and the Rh(III) complex partly reversed this effect. By contrast the activity of malic enzyme was increased by both <b>thioacetamide</b> and the Rh(III) complex and this effect probably relates to NADPH production for detoxification rather than for lipogenesis. Treatment with <b>thioacetamide</b> increased the rate of synthesis of di- and triacylglycerols from glycerol phosphate by liver homogenates, the activity of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and the incorporation of [3 H]glycerol into liver triacylglycerol in vivo. The Rh(III) complex did not produce a significant reversal of these effects of <b>thioacetamide</b> on glycerolipid synthesis. The total uptake of intraportally injected [3 H]glycerol by the livers of <b>thioacetamide</b> treated rats was decreased and this was associated with a lowered activity of glycerol kinase. <b>Thioacetamide</b> increased the activity of hepatic ornithine decarboxylase by about 40 -fold, but the Rh(III) complex did not reverse this effect.

40|$|Bile acid {{accumulation}} in liver with cholangiolar neoplastic lesions {{may occur}} before cholestasis is clinically detected. Whether this favors intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma {{development has been}} investigated in this study. The E. coli RecA gene promoter was cloned upstream from Luc 2 to detect in vitro direct genotoxic ability by activation of SOS genes. This assay demonstrated that bile acids {{were not able to}} induce DNA damage. The genotoxic effect of the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin was neither enhanced nor hindered by the hepatotoxic and hepatoprotective glycochenodeoxycholic and glycoursodeoxycholic acids, respectively. In contrast, <b>thioacetamide</b> metabolites, but not <b>thioacetamide</b> itself, induced DNA damage. Thus, <b>thioacetamide</b> was used to induce liver cancer in rats, which resulted in visible tumors after 30 weeks. The effect of bile acid accumulation on initial carcinogenesis phase (8 weeks) was investigated in bile duct ligated (BDL) animals. Serum bile acid measurement and determination of liver-specific healthy and tumor markers revealed that early <b>thioacetamide</b> treatment induced hypercholanemia together with upregulation of the tumor marker Neu in bile ducts, which were enhanced by BDL. Bile acid accumulation was associated with increased expression of interleukin (IL) - 6 and downregu-lation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Bile duct proliferation and apoptosis activation, with inverse pattern (BDL> <b>thioacetamide</b> þ BDL>> <b>thioacetamide</b> vs. thioacetamide> <b>thioacetamide</b> þ BDL> BDL), were observed. In conclusion, intrahepatic accumulation of bile acids does not induce carcinogenesis directly but facilitates a cocarcinogenic effect due to stimulation of bile duct proliferation, enhanced inflammation, and reduction in FXR-dependent chemoprotection.

40|$|Abstract: To assess {{modification}} of thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity in mice fed a high-fat diet, male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a normal rodent diet or a high-fat diet for 8 weeks and then treated once intraperitoneally with <b>thioacetamide</b> at 50 mg/kg body weight. At 24 and 48 hours after administration, massive centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis {{was observed in}} mice fed the normal rodent diet, while the necrosis was less severe in mice fed the high-fat diet. In contrast, severe swelling of hepatocytes was observed in mice fed the high-fat diet. In addition, mice fed the high-fat diet displayed more than a 4 -fold higher number of BrdU-positive hepatocytes compared with mice fed the normal rodent diet at 48 hours after <b>thioacetamide</b> treatment. To clarify the mechanisms by which the hepatic necrosis was attenuated, we investigated exposure to <b>thioacetamide</b> {{and one of its}} metabolites, the expression of CYP 2 E 1, which converts <b>thioacetamide</b> to reactive metabolites, and the content of glutathione S-transferases in the liver. However, the reduced hepatocellular necrosis noted in mice fed the high-fat diet could not be explained by the differences in exposure to <b>thioacetamide</b> or <b>thioacetamide</b> sulfoxide or by differences in the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes. On the other hand, at 8 hours after thio-acetamide administration, hepatic total glutathione in mice fed the high-fat diet was significantly lower than that in mice fed the normal diet. Hence, decreased hepatic glutathione amount is a candidate for the mechanism of the attenuated necrosis. In conclusion, this study revealed that thioacetamide-induced hepatic necrosis was attenuated in mice fed the high-fat diet. (DOI: 10. 1293 /tox. 26. 175; J Toxico...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The plant {{phenolic}} compounds such as flavonoids {{have an important}} role in the treatment of many diseases and some of them have a potent hepatoprotective effect. In this study, we have investigated the protective effects of polyphenolic extracts of Silybum marianum and Cichorium intybus on thioacethamide-induced hepatotoxicity in rat. The extracts were injected to the rats, at a dosis of 25 mg kgG body weight 1 together whit <b>thioacetamide</b> at a dosis of 50 mg kgG body weight. To assess the affectivity of extracts, against 1 <b>thioacetamide,</b> the activity of aminotransferases (SGOT and SGPT), alkalin phosphatase, bilirubin, Na and+ K were measured. Significant decrease in the activity of aminotransferases, alkalin phosphatase and+ bilirubin was observed in the groups treated with extracts and <b>thioacetamide</b> compared with the group that was treated only with <b>thioacetamide.</b> The level of Na, K and liver weight between different groups was not+ + significantly altered. This results prove the protective effect of extracts on liver cells. The protective effects of this extracts can be due to the presence of flavonoids compounds and their antioxidant effects...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of green tea on thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 64 male Wistar rats were allocated to eight groups. The control group received a normal diet alone, sham group received normal saline, hepatotoxic group received <b>thioacetamide</b> (50 mg/kg <b>thioacetamide</b> for three days), other groups received a <b>thioacetamide</b> for three days and the alcoholic extract of bgreen tea, at minimum (50 mg/kg), moderate (100 mg/kg), and maximum (200 mg/kg) doses, glutathione (250 mg/kg), green tea (200 mg/kg) with glutathione (250 mg/kg) for 21 days (i. p.). After that, blood samples were drawn and the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, Alkaline phosphatase, total protein and albumin, as liver injury indices, were measured. Results: The decrease of aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity in the receptors of different dosages of green tea and glutathione was significant compared with the group treated by <b>thioacetamide.</b> Also, a significant increase was observed in tota...|$|E
