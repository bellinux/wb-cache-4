Click chemistry has been utilized to functionalise the parent ligand with dansyl and coumarin moiety’s. These ligands {{have been used to}} successfully form four novel metal complexes upon reaction with iron(II) chloride. The stability and fluorescence of these complexes has been monitored. Imidazole ligands has been functionalised by the addition of alkyne and azide side chains to allow them to undergo click reactions. This modification has not been shown to impede complex formation, as the ligand have been utilized to form novel <b>triple</b> <b>stranded</b> iron(II) and nickel(II) complexes. Synchrotron imaging has been used to produce elemental maps of cells treated with the parent metallo cylinder. This has allowed the uptake of the complex to be monitored.

40|$|Two {{triple helix}} {{structures}} (15 -mers containing only T. A-T triplets or containing mixed T. A-T and C.

With the homo A/T target increased cleavage is observed towards the 3 '-end on the pyrimidine strand. These results show that the third strand is asymmetrically positioned along the groove with the tightest <b>triple</b> <b>strand</b> double strand interactions at the 5 '-end of the third strand.

40|$|We compare {{results of}} {{previous}} simulations {{of a simple}} model of DNA denaturation to the predictions of the Poland-Scheraga model. Concentrating on the critical region of the latter model we calculate both thermodynamic quantities and the distribution functions measured in the simulations. We find that the Poland-Scheraga model yields {{an excellent fit to}} the data, provided (i) we include a (singular) factor weighting the open ends of the doubly <b>stranded</b> <b>chain,</b> and (ii) we keep the leading corrections to the finite size scaling limit. The exponent c_ 1, which governs the end-weighting factor, is fairly well determined: 0. 1 <~ c_ 1 <~ 0. 15. The exponent c, which governs the length distribution of large loops, is determined only poorly. The data are compatible with values of c in at least the range 1. 9 <~ c <~ 2. 2. From the data it therefore cannot be decided whether the denaturation transition asymptotically is of first or of second order.

At each phase of the structural analysis, the homonuclear 3 D NOESY-HOHAHA and HOHAHA-NOESY spectra afforded valuable data, removing ambiguities intractable by conventional 2 D NMR techniques. CINC/Gro exists as a dimer in solution and contains a <b>triple</b> <b>stranded</b> anti-parallel β-sheet and C-terminal α-helix in the monomer structure, as observed in human IL- 8, but non-trivial differences are also observed...|$|R

40|$|Fully {{modified}} oligonucleotides were synthesised {{from the}} 3 -O-phosphoramidites of monomethoxytritylated trans- 3 -hydroxy-N-[(N- 6 -benzoyladenin- 9 -yl) -acetyl]-prolinol [(2 S, 3 R) and (2 R, 3 S) series], trans- 3 -hydroxy-N-[(thymin- 1 -yl) -acetyl] [(2 S, 3 R) and (2 R, 3 S) series], and cis- 3 -hydroxy-N-[(N- 6 -benzoyl-adenin- 9 -yl) -acetyl]-L-prolinol (2 R, 3 R). Remarkably, {{as well the}} L-trans (2 R, 3 S) as the D-trans (2 S, 3 R) all-adenine oligonucleotides are capable of hybridisation with complementary DNA and RNA. With modified ail-thymine trans-oligomers no complexation with natural nucleic acids was observed. However, complex formation between two modified strands of {{the same sense of}} chirality does occur with formation of a <b>triple</b> <b>stranded</b> complex. The all-thymine oligonucleotides with trans- 3 -HO-N-acetylprolinol backbone are capable of hybridisation with trans- 4 -HO-N-acetylprolinol oligoadenylates of the same enantiomeric form in both the D and the L series, and inversely, the all-adenine oligonucleotide with the trans- 3 -HO conformation hybridises with the trans- 4 -HO oligothymidylates. While the former interactions have a <b>triple</b> <b>stranded</b> origin, the latter are 1 : 1 interactions. No interactions were noticed upon mixing oligonucleotide analogues of different sense of chirality. Modified mixed trans- 3 -HO A,T sequences display no hybridisation with complementary nucleic acids, nor homocomplex formation. The L-cis all-adenine oligonucleotide hybridises with its RNA complement. Several complexes were investigated by circular dichroism and microcalorimetry. In conclusion, the 3 -hydroxy-N-acetylprolinol system represents an example of homochiral oligonucleotides built up from two enantiomeric forms and hybridizing both with natural nucleic acids.

40|$|AbstractA {{single strand}} of {{oligonucleotide}} {{can bind to}} double helical DNA under certain conditions. This must involve some unwinding of the original double helix in a process leading {{to the formation of}} a three-stranded region.

The conformation of the <b>triple</b> <b>strand</b> is investigated here using computer graphics and molecular mechanics calculations.

The homopolymer shows {{much higher}} thermal stability than its parent polynucleotides poly(7 -deazainosinic acid) [poly(c 7 I) ] and poly(I). Its sigmoidal melting curve and pronounced hypochromicity imply a rigid, ordered structure.
