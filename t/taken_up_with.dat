5|$|With intense media {{interest}} in the Beatles during 1963, the year was also <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> TV shows, press interviews and a weekly radio show. Despite these demands the band found time for many sessions in the recording studio, releasing two albums and four singles during the year. 1963 was also the year when Lennon's son Julian was born.|$|E

5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{thousand}} {{soldiers on the}} high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar. More than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway. Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield. Every available area of storage was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> ammunition, fuel, and other essential supplies. 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF messes at North Front.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

5|$|The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joy-filled {{market of}} people buying {{the makings of}} Christmas dinner and {{celebrations}} of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die soon unless {{the course of events}} changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.|$|E
5|$|After his release, he {{travelled}} to Schleswig-Holstein to join Baroness Gisela von Donner, {{an earlier}} acquaintance, on her estate {{and lived with}} her three children. During this time, Galland found work as a forestry worker. There he convalesced and came {{to terms with his}} career and alleged knowledge of Nazi war crimes. Galland began to hunt for the family and traded the kills in the local markets to supplement meagre meat rations. Soon Galland rediscovered his love of flying. Kurt Tank, the designer of the Fw 190, requested that he go to his home in Minden to discuss a proposal. Tank had been asked to work for the British and Soviets, and had narrowly avoided being forcibly kidnapped by the latter. Tank, through a contact in Denmark, informed Galland about the possibility of the Argentine Government employing him as a test pilot for Tank’s new generation of fighters. Galland accepted and flew to Argentina. He settled with Gisela in El Palomar, Buenos Aires. Galland enjoyed the slow life. His time there, aside from work commitments, was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Gisela and the active Buenos Aires night life. Galland found South America a world away from post-war shortages of Germany. Soon, he took up gliding again.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> TV shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they had no time for family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients could see it was him. After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E

5|$|The Rockefeller Center had {{originally}} been intended by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. {{to be a new}} location for the Metropolitan Opera House, but the Stock Market Crash brought an end to the scheme. Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead, taking advantage of the low construction costs during the recession. At the center of the development was the RCA Building, heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood. The long, slab-like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side, it appeared to be a narrow tower, from the other it rose like a sheer wall. Not only was the structure highly distinctive, but it was also economically very effective. The design maximized the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms, as the core of the building was entirely <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> elevators and other engineering services. It took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by tenants.|$|E
5|$|The {{next three}} weeks were <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> regimental and brigade training, until 17 September when the brigade started {{returning}} to the front line. The Hyderabad Lancers were detached from the brigade on 22 September to escort 12,000 prisoners to Kerkur, and on 23 September, B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company {{was attached to the}} brigade for the forthcoming operations. At 03:00 on 23 September, the brigade leading the 5th Cavalry Division left Afule for Haifa and Acre. The advance was unopposed until 10:00 that day when the Mysore Lancers reached the village of Beled Esh Sheikh where the leading squadron was shelled from Mount Carmel and came under small-arms fire from the region of the village. The Turkish had four artillery guns on the heights overlooking the brigade's line of approach and another six to the east of Haifa, supported by machine-gun posts and infantry {{to the west of the}} main Haifa road.|$|E
