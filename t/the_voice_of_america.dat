5|$|After Speers' {{retirement}} in 1957, John Middaugh was minister from 1958 to 1968. Middaugh {{was a regular}} panelist for ten years on the weekly television program To Promote Goodwill, an interfaith discussion of social and religious issues produced by WBAL-TV and broadcast worldwide on <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America.</b> He {{was also in the}} forefront {{of the civil rights movement}} in the early 1960s. Along with William Sloan Coffin and dozens of other clergymen and civil rights activists, Middaugh was arrested in a clash with police at Baltimore's Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in July 1963 over efforts to desegregate the popular attraction.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{broadcasts}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about the peaceful {{demise of the}} communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} controlled and party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free Europe was a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{successful}} tests by <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America's</b> VOA Radiogram program, international and government shortwave broadcasters began testing and experimenting with digital data over shortwave broadcast channels using the Fldigi software.These tests led to regular weekly digital broadcasts by the broadcasters listed below.|$|R
5|$|In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had {{the tree}} {{moved from the}} Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it {{remained}} until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled the lighting of the tree by remote control from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for the lighting ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President Dwight David Eisenhower's address was radio broadcast through <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> in thirty-four languages.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge at {{the embassy}} in Saigon, marking a change in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused to heed American pressure for reform. As the probability of Diệm sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility. Aware that the Americans would neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid cuts or sanctions, the generals deposed the Ngô brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.|$|E
50|$|Mukarram Khan Atif was a {{reporter}} for Dunya TV and Deewa Radio, a Pashto language radio channel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America's</b> Pashto language service.

Additionally, Moweta covers Hollywood {{news for the}} BBC evening program Africa World.|$|R
5|$|The {{detonation}} {{was initially}} planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because {{of rain and}} lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation. A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, while America {{geared up}} for front line {{involvement}} in World War II, Pflueger received fewer assignments {{than he had}} been seeing previously. Grover Magnin kept a flow of work with I. Magnin designs, and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden, Utah. He began to draw up plans for a 12-story cross-shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California, San Francisco (eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger). His firm accepted a commission to excavate below the Mark Hopkins Hotel {{in order to create a}} bomb-resistant radio transmission center for AM station KSFO and shortwave programs of <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America.</b> This space became the hotel's underground parking garage after the war.|$|E

50|$|Yet {{another method}} of {{preventing}} reception involves moving a domestic station {{to the frequency}} used by the international broadcaster. During the Batista government of Cuba, and during the Castro years, Cuban medium-wave stations broadcast on the frequencies of popular South Florida stations. In October 2002, Iraq changed frequencies of two stations to block <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America's</b> Radio Sawa program.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Mohr {{made a series}} of {{recordings}} for <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America.</b> Unlike most material for the VOA, these were intended for broadcast by radio stations in the United States, with the goal of debunking propaganda broadcast from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{preventing}} reception is jamming, or broadcasting a signal {{on the same}} frequencies as the international broadcaster. Germany jammed the BBC European service during the Second World War. Russian and Eastern European jammers were aimed against Radio Free Europe, other Western broadcasters, and against Chinese broadcasters during the nadir of Sino-Soviet relations. In 2002, the Cuban government jammed <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America's</b> Radio Martí program and the Chinese government jammed Radio Free Asia, <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> Radio Taiwan International as well broadcasts made by adherents of Falun Gong.|$|R
25|$|After {{converting}} to Christianity, Chick wanted to evangelize others, {{but he was}} too shy to talk to people directly about religion. Chick heard from missionary Bob Hammond, who had broadcast in Asia on <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> that the Communist Party of China had gained significant influence among ordinary Chinese in the 1950s through the distribution of small comic books. Chick also began working with a prison ministry and created a flip chart of illustrations to use with his presentation. He hit upon the idea of creating witnessing tracts, which could be given to people directly or indirectly.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-range}} {{interests of}} the United States are served by communicating directly with {{the peoples of the}} world by radio. To be effective, <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts. 1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive. 2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions. 3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.|$|E
25|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge in Saigon, marking {{a change}} in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused to remove them. As the probability of Diệm doing so was seen as highly unlikely, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. Lodge replied that there was no hope of Diệm removing Nhu, and began to make contact with possible coup plotters through CIA agents. <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the pagoda raids and absolving the army of culpability. Lodge believed Nhu's influence had risen to unprecedented levels and that Nhu's divide and conquer tactics had split the military into three power groups.|$|E
5000|$|... "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean" [...] is an American {{patriotic}} song {{which was}} {{popular in the}} United States during the early 20th and mid-19th centuries, especially during the U.S. Civil War era. [...] It functioned as an unofficial national anthem in competition with [...] "Hail, Columbia" [...] and [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] until the latter's formal adoption as the national anthem of the United States in 1931. For many years, the song's melody was used as <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America's</b> interval signal.|$|R
50|$|Stations also {{broadcast}} to international audiences for cultural reasons. Often a station has an official mandate to keep expatriates {{in touch with}} the home country. Many broadcasters often relay their national domestic service on shortwave for that reason. Other reasons include teaching a foreign language, such as Radio Exterior de España's Spanish class, Un idioma sin fronteras, or <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>America's</b> broadcasts in Special English. In the case of major broadcasters such as the BBC World Service or Radio Australia, there is also an educational outreach.|$|R
