5|$|In Birkenau, Vrba had {{encountered}} an acquaintance from Trnava, Alfréd Wetzler (prisoner no.29162), {{who was working}} in the mortuary. The two men hatched an escape plan, and on 7 April 1944, with the help of two other prisoners, they hid inside a pile of wood stacked between the camp's inner and outer perimeter fences, sprinkling the area with tobacco soaked in gasoline <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> the dogs.|$|E

50|$|A Farewell <b>to</b> <b>Fools</b> is a 2013 {{independent}} drama film {{directed by}} Bogdan Dreyer, produced by Giuliano Doman, Daniel Zuta and written by Anusavan Salamanian. The film stars Gérard Depardieu, Harvey Keitel, Laura Morante, and Bogdan Iancu. A Farewell <b>to</b> <b>Fools</b> was filmed in the Romanian cities of Bucharest and Sighișoara.|$|R
5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given {{a tour of the}} Enron Energy Services office, they were {{impressed}} with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was. This ruse was used several times <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, both St-Pierre and Koscheck had Johnson {{at the top}} of their lists when it came time to select fighters. During the team {{selection}} process however, St-Pierre created a fake list which did not have Johnson among his top selections, and subtly showed it to Koscheck <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> him into believing it. This seemed to manipulate Koscheck into picking Marc Stevens, as he may have believed he could take Johnson later. This allowed St-Pierre to choose Johnson with the second overall pick.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy {{begins to}} {{question}} the reason why his sons want to {{spend so much time}} with him. One day, Tracy sees a special about Lyle and Erik Menendez—the two brothers who became famous for killing their parents—which leads him to believe that his sons are plotting to kill him. As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks like him to use as a decoy <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and {{has been reported to}} persist for three hours after it has been taken out of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E

5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Centurion {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. Although she {{spent much of her}} time in reserve, she had a peripheral role in the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. After her return home in 1924, the ship became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. In 1926 Centurion was converted into a target ship and participated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of aerial bombing in addition to her normal duties. During the Second World War, the ship was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. When that operation was cancelled, she was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{received}} {{the ball to}} start {{the third quarter and}} drove down the field on rushing plays by Donald Brown, Jordan Todman and Tyler Lorenzen, before the drive stalled at the Buffalo 36-yard line. UConn punter Desi Cullen's punt was downed at the Buffalo 1-yard line, pinning them against their own end zone. The Bulls were unable to move the ball, punting the ball back to UConn after three plays. Starting from their own 44-yard line, the Huskies drove to within the Buffalo 10-yard line; an offside penalty on Buffalo's Jerry Housey gave UConn a 1st-and-goal at the Buffalo 4-yard line. Connecticut used a play-action pass, only their second pass attempt of the game, <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> the Bulls; UConn tight end Steve Brouse was wide open in the end zone, catching the ball for the touchdown and giving Connecticut back the lead at 24–20 with 5:22 left in the third quarter.|$|E

5|$|In February 1975, {{during the}} midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a North Vietnamese deserter {{surrendered}} himself to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the North Vietnamese soldier revealed the whereabouts of North Vietnamese units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were gearing up for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, North Vietnamese artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North Vietnamese would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of {{about two or three}} North Vietnamese combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum during the month of February were designed by the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> South Vietnamese military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater {{as the central}} focus of French efforts, but in both {{instances}} the Italian theater became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest. Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal Masséna would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the Armée d'Italie, St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout.

Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E

As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 1975, the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps officially {{commenced}} {{its campaign}} against South Vietnamese forces of I Corps. The opening {{shots of the}} campaign was marked by an attack on South Vietnamese military convoys on Mount Hai Van, {{and the destruction of}} An Lo Bridge on National Highway 1, located north of Huế. Positions held by the ARVN 913th Regional Force at Dong Ong Do and Hill-368 also came under attack, as Phu Bai Airbase was subjected to intense artillery bombardment. While the South Vietnamese were busy dealing with those attacks, General Nguyen Huu An secretly redeployed the 325th Division and the 9th Regiment of the 304th Division, from Quảng Trị towards Huế in the south. The 46th and 271st Regiment then moved into positions previously held by the 325th Division and 9th Regiment. And, <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> South Vietnamese intelligence agencies, the North Vietnamese also moved tank and artillery units to Cua Viet, Thanh Hoi and Ai Tu to cover their main thrust.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database <b>to</b> <b>fool</b> it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E
