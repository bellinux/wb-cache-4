5|$|Predators such {{as other}} ants and the <b>thorny</b> <b>devil</b> lizard (Moloch horridus) {{predominantly}} feed on Ochetellus workers; {{the number of}} ants that a <b>thorny</b> <b>devil</b> can consume per minute is around 24 to 45.

5|$|The colonies {{are found}} in rotten wood, in the ground, under rocks or stones and in urban areas. The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees, in low {{vegetation}} and into human homes, where they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, sucrose, nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The <b>thorny</b> <b>devil,</b> an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers, and other ant species also prey on them.|$|E
5|$|Some {{invertebrate}} species specialise in predation of Iridomyrmex ants. One spider in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is {{a specialist}} predator against these ants and {{will use the}} alarm pheromones that are released by the ants during territorial disputes to locate them. The Australian <b>thorny</b> <b>devil</b> lizard (Moloch horridus) is a sit and wait predator that primarily preys on Iridomyrmex ants, and one lizard will reject specific species in this genus while eating others. The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follows trails laid by these ants to locate them as a potential prey species and will eat the broods of some species, while ground beetles dig burrows near ant nests to prey on workers passing by.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thorny</b> <b>devils</b> are nocturnal feeders {{and group}} {{together}} {{during the day}} to hide under bark and in trees hollows, providing protection from predators. Like other types of stick insects they use crypsis and catalepsy to evade predators.|$|R
50|$|Animals {{occurring}} in the region include feral camels, dingos, goannas (including the large perentie) and numerous species of lizard and birds.

25|$|There {{are more}} than 700 species of lizards in Australia with representatives of five families. There are over 130 species in 20 genera of gecko found {{throughout}} the Australian continent. The Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; all 39 species from seven genera occur in Australia. The Agamidae or dragon lizards are represented by 70 species in 14 genera, including the <b>thorny</b> <b>devil,</b> bearded dragon and frill-necked lizard. There are 30 species of monitor lizard, family Varanidae, in Australia, where they {{are commonly known as}} goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the perentie, which can reach up to 2m in length. There are about 450 species of skink from more than 40 genera, comprising more than 50% of the total Australian lizard fauna; this group includes the blue-tongued lizards.|$|E

5000|$|The thorny dragon or <b>thorny</b> <b>devil</b> (Moloch horridus) is an Australian lizard, {{also known}} as the {{mountain}} devil, the thorny lizard, or the moloch. This is the sole species of genus Moloch. The thorny dragon grows up to 20 cm in length, and it can live for 15 to 20 years. Most of these lizards are coloured in camouflaging shades of desert browns and tans. These colours change from pale colours during warm weather and to darker colours during cold weather. These animals are covered entirely with conical spines that are mostly uncalcified.|$|E
50|$|The <b>thorny</b> <b>devil</b> color {{ranges from}} pale green to brown and resembles bark or rotten wood. Both sexes are {{wingless}} and armored with spines on body and legs. Exhibiting the sexual dimorphism of many similar insects (particularly other phasmids {{as well as}} mantises), males are small and thinner, less than 5 inches (11-12 cm) long while females are typically 6 inches (15 cm) in length. The male has enlarged hind leg femurs with a curved spine or thorn on the underneath side, {{large enough to be}} used as a fish hook in New Guinea. Females have a larger abdomen tipped with an ovipositor.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>thorny</b> <b>devil</b> also {{features}} a spiny [...] "false head" [...] {{on the back of}} its neck, and the lizard presents this to potential predators by dipping its real head. The [...] "false head" [...] is made of soft tissue. The females are larger than the males. The thorny dragon's scales are ridged, enabling the animal to collect water from any part of its body. That water is then conveyed to its mouth. So to drink water, they touch water, usually with their limbs, and via the capillary principle, water is transported to the mouth through their skin.|$|E
5000|$|A dinosaur with barbed spikes {{surrounding}} its body. This dinosaur {{was based}} on an Scelidosaurus/Ankylosaur (Its design also somewhat resembles the <b>thorny</b> <b>devil).</b> It is more nimble than a Cold One and is able to move across the battlefield quickly. When attacked, it will use its tail as a club and thrashes to attack the opponent. It can release its long spines by using a massive muscle spasm to dislodge the spikes and hurl them towards the enemy. It is said to be like being hit by thousands of arrows and those struck, if not killed outright, rapidly bleed to death from injuries caused by the barbed spines.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 150 {{bird species}} have been {{observed}} including the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) and Australian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus). Some of the recorded mammal species in the interior include the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and spinifex hopping mouse (Notomys alexis). The only observed bat in the park is the Finlayson's cave bat (Vespadelus finlaysoni). The recorded reptile species include the <b>thorny</b> <b>devil</b> (Moloch horridus), western bearded dragon (Pogona minor) and central netted dragon (Ctenophorus nuchalis). The only observed amphibian is Günther's toadlet (Pseudophryne guentheri). About 30 different arthropods have been recorded including a dragonfly called the Pilbara tiger (Ictinogomphus dobsoni) and the savanna black tree ant (Tetraponera punctulata).|$|E
