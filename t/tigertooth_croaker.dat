50|$|Philometra otolithi is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} nematode of fishes, infecting the gonads of marine perciform fishes off the eastern Indian coast. It was first found in the <b>tigertooth</b> <b>croaker,</b> Otolithes ruber. It is distinguished from its cogenerates by the gubernaculum structure in males, {{as well as the}} shape and structure of the females' cephalic and caudal ends, and their oesophagus.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperGrowth {{parameters}} and mortality of the <b>tigertooth</b> <b>croaker</b> (Otolithes ruber) were estimated from length frequency data collected during trawl surveys in the Persian Gulf (Bushehr waters) from 1997 - 1998. LFDA and FiSAT Programs {{were used for}} data analyses. Growth parameters were estimated as L∞ = 58 cm and K = 0. 8 per year. The estimate of total mortality is Z = 2. 7 year⁻¹ giving a fishing mortality of F= 1. 46 year⁻¹ and on exploitation ratio of E = 0. 55. Natural mortality was estimated from the Pauly’s formula (1980) which resulted in M= 1. 24 year⁻¹. Biomass estimation of swept area survey in 1994 was applied to calculate MSY. The MSY of Otolithes ruber is assessed between 145. 8 - 154. 4 tonnes. Results of the research indicate the fishery is operating very close to its maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level and that no further increase in fishing effort is advisable...|$|E
40|$|Vitellogenesis, oocyte {{maturation}} pattern, spawning rhythm, spawning frequency, batch fecundity and oocyte diameter-frequency {{distribution of}} the <b>tigertooth</b> <b>croaker,</b> Otolithes ruber (Schneider, 1801) in Kuwaiti waters were investigated from March 1999 to February 2000 and from January to May 2005, using histological and morphological methods. Oogenesis is described in four phases: vitellogenic, mature, spent and regressed. Vitellogenesis, in turn, is described in three classes: early vitellogenic, mid-vitellogenic and late vitellogenic. Development of the yolky oocyte is an asynchronous process resulting, {{by the time of}} oocyte maturation, in a clear differentiation between a ready batch of oocytes (ready for spawning) and a reserve pool. Consequently, O. ruber is capable of spawning multiple times during the reproductive season. Spawning frequency estimates, based on the final oocyte maturation (FOM) method indicated that the species spawns once every 2. 8 days, while the estimates based on the post-ovulatory follicle (POF) method indicated a spawning every 2. 2 days, during a 5 -month spawning season lasting from January to May. Batch fecundity (BF) was significantly positively correlated with both ovary-free body weight (OFBW) (...|$|E
40|$|Food {{and feeding}} habits of {{fourteen}} demersal finfishes exploited off the Karnataka coast were studied to investigate trophic interactions within the marine food web. The demersal finfi shes {{selected for the}} present study are Epinephelus diacanthus (rockcod), Grammopli/es suppasitus (spotfin flathead), Priacan/hus hamrur (bulls eye), Johnieops sina (drab jew fish), O/oli/hes cuvieri (lesser <b>tigertooth</b> <b>croaker),</b> Nempilerus japanicus (threadfin bream), Nemipterus mesoprion (thread fin bream), Leiognathus bindlls (si lvcrbclly), CYlloglosslIS macros/om liS (tongue sole), PUII/PIIS argenteus (silver pomfret), Lactarill. v lactarill. r (bigjawed jumper), Pseudorhombus arsius (Iargetooth flounder), Carcharhinus Iimba/us (blacktip shark) and Rhync'loba/us djiddensis (guitar fish). • For understanding the importance of various diet components, the widely accepted diet index, the Index of Relative Importance (IRI), which integrates large data on three diet indices such as number, volume or weight and frequency of occurrence, was used to quantify diet components of each predator. Ontogenetic, seasonal (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon) variation in feeding and prey-predator relationship studies were conducted. Prey-spece fi c abundance plots (Amundson plot) and Electivity index were drawn to interpret each predators feeding strategy and prey se lectivity respectively. • The resu lts showed that the rockcod, E. diacanthus is a demersal carnivore and preferred to feed largely on benthic crustaceans. Crustaceans followed by fishes and molluscs were the most important food components of E. diacanti 1 l 1 s. Of all the stomachs analysed, 73...|$|E
