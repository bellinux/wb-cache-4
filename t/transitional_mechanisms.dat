The data sample is first expanded to seven years (1990 - 1996). Modifications to the environment structure conceptual models are: (1) introduction of two Dominant Ridge synoptic regions named Ridge Poleward and Ridge Equatorward based on the bowed orientation of the subtropical anticyclone; and (2) combining the Weak Westerlies and Accelerating Westerlies into just one synoptic region called Midlatitude Westerlies. Only eight synoptic pattern/region combinations are needed to classify all of the 1858 cases. Additions to the <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include: (1) the formation and dissipation of the mid-level low; (2) monsoon trough formation; and (3) orography.

(1997) of the Systematic Approach to tropical cyclone (TC) track forecasting meteorological knowledge base to the Southern Hemisphere has been extended to eight seasons (1990 - 91 through 1997 - 98), which includes 145 (90) cyclones in the South Indian (Pacific) region. A total of 3257 synoptic pattern/region classifications could be described in the context of only four synoptic patterns and 11 synoptic regions. Updated track summaries in each pattern/region combination, and the recurring (more than three) environment structure transitions are provided. Refinements in the set of TC-environment <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the meteorological knowledge base include: (1) new Equatorial Westerly Wind Burst Mechanism; (2) new semi-direct TC interaction equatorward conceptual model; (3) additional variations of the Subtropical Ridge Modulation mechanisms; and (4) further cases of Vertical Wind Shear leading to dramatic TC track changes.

Although the logarithmic layer of wall-bounded turbulence is used as the primary example, most conclusions also apply to turbulent flows with a uniform shear, as well as probably to other flows with linearly stable mean profiles. They are dominated by large-scale streamwise-velocity streaks and intermittent bursts of the cross-shear velocity. When the linearised problem is solved in the limit of small viscosity, it has previously been shown that many properties, such as the bursting time and length scales, the energy fluxes between components, and the mean inclination angles, agree well between linear and nonlinear systems. The question addressed here is whether the structures predicted by the linearised solution can be traced in fully nonlinear simulations. It is found that the largest scales of strong bursts are well described linearly, but that the weaker fluctuations are not...|$|E

These mechanisms are the fund of assistance of survivors (FARG), the memory of the genocide of Tutsi, the Gacaca popular jurisdictions and the national unity and reconciliation commission. The results show that all these instruments have the potential to improve the reconciliation process. However, it appeared also that some of them, especially the Gacaca courts and the memory of the genocide have also some negative effetcs on the process. In addition, the study shows that the rôle of FARG in stabilizing social relations is very limited. On the contrary, the fund creates jalousy among those populations who do not benefit from its services. The thesis highlights the fact that the trust between Hutu and Tutsi is neither possible, nor necessary. Rwandans progressively accept each other without neccessarily trusting one another. Reconciliation in Rwanda must focus not on relations or emotions but on interests of all groups. This is the reason why the common projects betwenn Hutu and Tutsi may be of greater importance.

SUSTAIN’s simulations suggest that conceptual development follows a continuous and smooth trajectory despite qualitative changes in behavior and that the mechanisms that underlie infant and adult categorization might not differ significantly. The ability to form categories of distinct objects is of critical importance in human cognition. Consequently, there has been a keen interest in understanding how this ability develops.

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} reappraisal of {{transitional}} justice through {{the study of}} the nature and function {{of the rule of law}} it conveys. As originally conceived, transitional justice embraces a concept of the rule of law that is sensitive to the conditions of the political transition, in which law is caught in inexorable tensions between the past and the future. Yet, the increasing use of transitional justice to deal with armed conflicts and human rights violations irrespective of any political transition has created a conceptual and normative disorder, which leads to assimilating the use of <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to that of transitional justice. Should transitional justice apply to situations other than those of political transition? In what other transition-like situations is a sui generis concept of the rule of law justified? Can transitional justice mechanisms be used in situations other than political transitions? The author analyzes these questions bearing in mind that an enlarged and unjustified use of transitional justice may render the concept of transitional justice analytically, descriptively, and normatively meaningless to law. The case study of Colombia shows the perverse effects of conceptual vagueness and brings to light the practical impacts that using an enlarged conception of transitional justice has upon the ordinary rule of law.

The Nigerian government’s offer of political asylum to Taylor, and attempts to pressure the Special Court to lift his indictment threatens to undermine peace in the sub-region. Furthermore, it sends a terrible message about the sub-region’s commitment to justice. The paper argues that accountability for crimes committed during more than a decade of conflict is an essential first step toward ensuring long-term peace in the sub-region. To achieve lasting peace and democratiza-tion, I conclude that a regional approach is urgently needed to resolve the sub-region’s interconnected conflicts.

Huge, sparsely populated address spaces render it highly resistant to malicious scans and inhospitable to automated, scanning and self-propagating worms and hybrid threats.

For example, IPv 6 does not protect against misconfigured servers, poorly designed applications, or poorly protected sites. In addition, IPv 6 and IPv 6 <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> introduce new, not widely understood, tools and techniques that intruders can use to secure unauthorized activity from detection.

40|$|Abstract—To further {{elucidate}} adsorption-to-partition <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{which have}} been proposed previously for organo-bentonites with different surfactant loadings, the structural characteristics of interlayer surfactant aggregates on organo-bentonite with different surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide loading levels (0. 202. 56 times cation exchange capacity, CEC) have been investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The sorption properties {{and the structure of}} the clay interlayers changed according to the type of surfactant, the surfactant loading level, and the state of hydration in the clays. Based on the sorption of nitrobenzene, phenol, and aniline to organo-bentonites, the contaminant sorption coefficients (Ksf), normalized with the organic carbon content, show a remarkable dependence on surfactant loading levels. The Ksf values first increased with surfactant loading until reaching a maximum at 1. 0 to 1. 2 times the CEC, and then decreased. According to the theoretical calculation of the volume fractions relating to the interlamellar space, the interlamellar microenvironment became a more hydrophobic medium, contributing to the dissolution of organic contaminants, as the surfactant loading increased from 0. 20 to 2. 56 times the CEC. However, the increase in packing density (r) for the intercalates, and induced steric hindrances both affect the result in terms of a reduction in the accessible free space where the organic contaminants can be located, which might be a negative factor in the sorption capacity...|$|E

This Meteorological knowledge base for application of the Systematic Approach to Tropical Cyclone Track Forecasting in the Atlantic basin follows from similar knowledge bases previously developed for the western North Pacific, the eastern and central North Pacific, and the Southern Hemisphere. A common environment structure terminology has been adopted in which three synoptic patterns (Standard, Poleward, and Midlatitude) are found in each of these basins. Each basin also has a special pattern, which in the Atlantic is the Upper-level low. The conceptual models for these synoptic patterns with their associated synoptic regions are described here via a conceptual model, analysis examples, and the characteristic track segments within each region. A climatology of occurrences in each patter/region for the 1568 cases during 1990 - 98 is prepared. The second key element in the knowledge base is the <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that change the environment structure and thus change the tropical cyclone steering flow. Conceptual models for these mechanisms are presented and illustrated with sequences of analyses. A climatology of recurring (at least four occurrences in nine years) transitions is prepared to indicate the most common track changes during these transitions.

The Meteorological knowledge base of the Systematic Approach to tropical cyclone track forecasting in the Southern Hemisphere has been updated to reflect a more global terminology. Examples of these new environment structures in operational (NOGAPS) analyses and tracks are given. Perhaps the most important conclusion is that all cases in the 1990 - 91 through 1998 - 1999 seasons could be classified into one of these 14 synoptic pattern/region combinations. The nine-year "climatology" of the occurrences of each ofthe 14 combinations is given for the South Indian and Pacific Oceans separately, and the characteristic tracks in each of these 14 combinations are provided. Some new <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> between these combinations have also been defined. The importance of these transitions from one pattern/region combinations to another is that the TC track then also changes. The frequency of recurring (greater than three) transitions in this nine-year sample is summarized. Because the TC is at any time in only one pattern/region combination, the concern of the forecaster is on the possible transitions from that pattern/region. To assist the forecaster, the percentages of these transitions from each pattern/region combination are also summarized. Some ofthese transitions are clearly more favored than others, which is useful guidance to the forecaster.

40|$|WOS: 000387298600021 International audienceThis paper aims at {{understanding}} the numerical dissipation mechanisms {{related to the}} Spectral Difference (SD) method {{in the context of}} three-dimensional (3 D) turbulence. The numerical dissipation stemming from the discretization of the convective terms is studied by performing inviscid computations of the transitional Taylor-Green vortex and isotropic turbulence configurations. The Taylor-Green vortex computations show that the increase in the order of accuracy restricts the numerical dissipation to smaller scales which, in turn, leads to a better representation of <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> However, isotropic turbulence computations using a fifth-order accuracy or above show obvious manifestations of under resolution (such as the onset of oscillations and numerical noise), which suggests that the high-order numerical dissipation alone is unable to mimic the dissipation originating from sub-grid scales in the case freely decaying turbulence. Computations of the Channel flow configuration at Re-tau = 1000 at typical large-eddy simulation resolutions show that under-resolved SD discretizations using a high order of accuracy (fifth and sixth) lead to an excellent prediction of the wall-friction, the velocity profiles, the turbulent structures near the wall and the energy spectra, while lower order discretizations lead to an underestimation of the wall-friction and globally a poor representation of wall-bounded turbulence. The present study emphasizes the benefit of using high-order SD discretizations for an accurate representation of turbulent phenomena (namely, transitional and wall-bounded turbulence) but also the necessity of combining this approach with dynamic large-eddy simulation models or appropriate regularization techniques which would activate only where needed to recover physically consistent results, e. g., in regions where fully developed turbulence is present.

40|$|Aims: Initiating {{mechanisms}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) remain poorly understood, involving complex interaction between triggers and the atrial substrate. This {{study sought to}} classify the transitional phenomena, hypothesizing that there is consistency within and between patients in trigger-substrate interaction during transition to AF. Methods and results: Non-contact left atrial (LA) mapping was performed in 17 patients undergoing ablation for paroxysmal AF. All had spontaneous ectopy. Left atrial activation from the first ectopic to established AF was examined offline to characterize the initiating and transitional sequence of activation. In 57 fully mapped spontaneous AF initiations in 8 patients, all involved interaction of pulmonary venous/LA triggers with a septopulmonary line of block (SP-LOB) also evident in sinus rhythm, by 4 different <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> characterized by (i) continuous focal firing: AF resulted from fragmentation of each ectopic wavefront through gaps in the SP-LOB and persisted only while focal firing continued (n = 18 / 32 %) (ii) transient focal firing, wavefront fragmentation at the SP-LOB produced wavelet re-entry that persisted after cessation of an initiating ectopic source (n = 12 / 21 %), (iii) of two separate interacting ectopic foci (n = 15 / 26 %), or from (iv) transiently stable macroreentry (n = 12 / 21 %), around the SP-LOB extending to the LA roof, resulting in progressive wavefront fragmentation. It was found that 79 ± 22 % {{of each of the}} initiations in individual patients showed the same triggering mechanism. Conclusion: Onset of paroxysmal AF can be described by discrete mechanistic categories, all involving interaction of ectopic activity with a common SP-LOB.

Law and lawyers are concerned with these changes and the introduction of a Human Rights culture in Northern Ireland.

The Power of Silence: Impunity and Accountability in Lebanon by Michelle Bouchebel {{explores the}} extent to which <b>transitional</b> justice <b>mechanisms</b> could help to strengthen accountability {{and the rule of law}} in Lebanon and suggests several options for the kinds of <b>transitional</b> justice <b>mechanisms</b> that could be explored, taking into account the current political context of the country. The study draws on, and seeks to contribute to, literature on transitional justice as well as literature on the Lebanese civil war and its aftermath. In an effort to assess the feasibility of implementing <b>transitional</b> justice <b>mechanisms</b> in Lebanon, the study develops four criteria: political feasibility, impact on rule of law, economic viability and potential for quick wins. Applying these criteria, the study argues that judicial reform targeting the independence of the judiciary; security sector reform targeting the behavior and mindsets of both the Internal Security Forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces, and adopting a bottom-up, civil society-led informal truth process, could be expected to produce some tangible results in the short to medium-term. It further argues that their real importance lies in the normative change they would bring to Lebanese politics with regard to dealing with the past: towards a more just and more equal society and away from a culture of kleptocracy and muhasasa which have dominated the post-war reconstruction and reform efforts in the country. 1 hard copy: xii, 147 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
