The <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the <b>test</b> <b>piece.</b> Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the volume flow rate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{unconfined}} compressive strength (UCS) of a novel chemical grout composed of a calcium phosphate compound (CPC-Chem), we performed UCS tests and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations on sand <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> cemented with CPC-Chem and four kinds of powders (tricalcium phosphate, TCP; magnesium phosphate, MgP; calcium carbonate, CC and magnesium carbonate, MgC) as seed crystals. The UCS of the CPC-Chem <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> cemented with TCP and CC was significantly {{greater than that of}} the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with no added powders. The UCS of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with TCP and CC additives exceeded the targeted value of 100 kPa and increased to a maximum of 261. 4 kPa and 209. 7 kPa for the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with TCP and CC additives, respectively. Furthermore, the UCS of <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with 1 wt% or 5 wt% TCP and 1 wt% CC additives was maintained at a level exceeding 200 kPa for 168 days. SEM observations revealed net-like and three-dimensional structures in segments of <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> cemented with 1 wt% or 5 wt% TCP and 1 wt% CC in CPC-Chem, which could have been the reason of the long-term stability of UCS (over 200 kPa for 168 days) observed in this study. These results suggest that the addition of TCP and CC significantly enhances the ground improvement afforded by CPC-Chem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the bubbles during composites manufacturing, a special performance was designed. And {{the effects of the}} speed of the resin injection on bubble content were investigated. The results demonstrate that the speed of resin injection has distinct effects on the bubble content. When the speed of resin injection is slightly higher than the speed of capillary injection, the bubble content of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with latitudinal fiber bundles is more than the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> without latitudinal fiber bundles. But when the speed of the resin injection is slower than the speed of capillary injection, the bubble content of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with latitudinal fiber bundles is less than the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> without latitudinal fiber bundles. These results will provide a reference for the design of RTM process parameters...|$|R
25|$|Temperature {{must also}} be {{accounted}} for because the air pump will heat the air passing through it making the air down stream of it less dense and more viscous. This difference must be corrected for. Temperature is measured at the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> plenum and at the metering element plenum. Correction factors are then applied during flow calculations. Some flow bench designs place the air pump after the metering element so that heating by the air pump is not as large a concern.|$|E

500|$|Egdon Heath (1927) was Holst's {{first major}} orchestral work after The Planets. Matthews summarises the music as [...] "elusive and {{unpredictable}} [...] three main elements: a pulseless wandering melody , a sad brass processional, and restless music for strings and oboe." [...] The mysterious dance {{towards the end}} is, says Matthews, [...] "the strangest moment in a strange work". Richard Greene in Music & Letters describes the piece as [...] "a larghetto dance in a siciliano rhythm with a simple, stepwise, rocking melody", but lacking the power of The Planets and, at times, monotonous to the listener. A more popular success was the Moorside Suite for brass band, written as a <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> for the National Brass Band Festival championships of 1928. While written within the traditions of north-country brass band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, [...] "from the skipping 6/8 of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of Saturn".|$|E

Carburization was performed on the one surface of <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> seeking to analyze extent of acted normal stresses to autodeformation of steel. Different bending loads were applied for analyzed steel from 5  MPa to 100  MPa. Deflection of <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> was analyzed.

Particular results of stretched and compressed surface examination showed different behavior of <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> during tempering process. Test pieces, which undergo deformation at the beginning of martensitic transformation, after unloading bend further. When tempered <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> with assimetrically carburized layer bend during hardening, its direction and extent of autodeformation depend on depth of carburization and tempering temperature. Kinetics of autodeformation (during tempering) is affected by difference of volume changes in the carburized part and in the unaffected low carbon part of specimen, and similarly by decomposition of retained austenite in the carburized part.
