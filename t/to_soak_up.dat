Key members of the creative team at the time – Pam Coats, Barry Cook, Ric Sluiter, Robert Walker, and Mark Henn – were invited to travel to China as a research trip to study the landscape, people, and history of the original legend. From June 17 to July 2, 1994, the research trip flew to Beijing, China, which is where Pam Coats became inspired by the placement of flags on the Great Wall, Datong, Luoyang, Xi'an, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang, and Guilin.|$|E

50|$|The kansui is the {{distinguishing}} {{ingredient in}} ramen noodles, and originated in Inner Mongolia, where some lakes contained {{large amounts of}} these minerals and whose water {{is said to be}} perfect for making these noodles. Making noodles with kansui lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture. Eggs may also be substituted for kansui. Some noodles are made with neither eggs nor kansui and should only be used for yakisoba, as they have a weaker structure and are more prone <b>to</b> <b>soaking</b> <b>up</b> moisture and becoming extremely soft when served in soup.|$|R

25|$|The {{prototype}} R.B.1, {{with the}} designation Iris I, {{and with the}} serial number N185, made its maiden flight from Blackburn's factory at Brough on 19 June 1926, being delivered to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe the next day, being fully tested during July and August. Wooden hulls were prone <b>to</b> <b>soaking</b> <b>up</b> large quantities of water (which could amount to several hundred pounds in additional weight) when kept afloat {{for long periods of}} time, so Rennie designed an all-metal hull for the Iris, constructed of duralumin before the Iris first flew. N185 returned to Brough in March 1927 when it was fitted with the new metal hull, together with more powerful engines and an additional gunner's position in the tail, becoming the Iris II.|$|R

The approximate surface area of the field is 48000 sq ft of astroturf, completely encircled with a combination of stone and metal fencing. In case of rain, the field has a 1 km long drainage system that runs underneath, allowing the field <b>to</b> rapidly <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> and drain away large amounts of water.

25|$|Work on MX also continued, and by {{the mid-1970s}} the {{preferred}} MX basing mode was the Multiple Protective Shelter (MPS) concept. In this system each MX missile would be installed in a network of hardened shelters, 23 in most plans, and moved between them at random. The transports would be camouflaged and duplicated so the Soviets would not know where the missiles were. A counterforce attack would thus require the Soviets to expend 23 warheads for every MX missile to ensure destruction. With a total of 4,500 shelters and 200 missiles moving between them, the system could soak up {{a significant portion of}} the Soviet's 5,928 ICBM warheads and survive. In this basing mode, a system like Safeguard was of little use. If the Soviets needed to fire 4,500 warheads to ensure the destruction of the MX force, expending another 100 <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> an ABM system was of little consequence.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the midwife}} {{received}} the infant, {{placed it in}} pieces of cloth, cut the umbilical cord, and cleansed the baby. The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call {{on whether or not}} an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear {{whether or not it was}} robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.|$|E
500|$|While {{the storm}} was over water, small craft {{advisories}} were issued by the Coast Guard in addition to cautioning people on vacation in South Padre Island to avoid the beaches. However, {{as it was a}} Sunday evening, most of the ships were already coming into port. As Amelia approached the Texas coast, gale warnings were issued for the area from Brownsville to Port O'Connor on July 30. Due to it forming in close proximity to the coast, warnings were issued as soon as {{the storm was}} named. [...] As the state had been {{in the midst of a}} severe drought the previous six weeks, there was hope that Amelia would relieve the dry conditions.

40|$|Porous {{concrete}} {{offers an}} environmentally friendly alternative to light traffic pavement applications. Porous concrete is generally {{used as an}} initial drainage system to absorb most, if not all, of a catchment runoff. This relieves the pressure on storm water drains and can {{reduce the need for}} kerbing and expansive storm water systems which can help to reduce stormwater infrastructure costs. Porous concrete also helps filter stormwater runoff by capturing all pollutants and filtering them through the sub-base and soil instead of pollutants flowing to downstream water bodies. By filtering the runoff this recharges underground water tables and recharges local vegetation water supplies by allowing the water <b>to</b> be <b>soaked</b> <b>up</b> in the immediate catchment area. Porous concrete is used for light traffic applications such as foot paths, traffic islands, driveways and car parks. Porous concrete drains standing water increasing safety whilst driving by reducing aqua planning and light glare.

They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch {{to see if we could}} find the story.

500|$|Station to Station {{is often}} cited as a {{transitional}} album in Bowie's career. Nicholas Pegg, author of The Complete David Bowie, called it a [...] "precise halfway point on the journey from Young Americans to Low", while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it [...] "effectively divides the '70s for David Bowie. It ties off the era of Ziggy Stardust and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with Low." [...] In terms of Bowie's own output, Station to Stations Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like [...] "Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] (1973), while its funk/disco elements were a development of the soul/R sound of Young Americans (1975). More recently Bowie had begun <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> the influence of [...] krautrock and electronic music by bands like Neu!, Can, and Kraftwerk. Thematically the album revisited concepts dealt with in songs such as [...] "The Supermen" [...] from The Man Who Sold the World (1970) and [...] "Quicksand" [...] from Hunky Dory (1971): Nietzsche's 'Overman', the occultism of Aleister Crowley, Nazi fascination with Grail mythology, and the Kabbalah. Pegg considered the album's theme to be a clash of [...] "occultism and Christianity".|$|E

[...] Contemporaneous medical science placed much weight on humorism, and for a short period tobacco became a panacea. [...] Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so important to a healthy person.

Once the hurricane reached the coast of Long Island, it dumped an additional 13 to 20 inches of rain on Connecticut over a two-day period.

Most notably, fans {{are familiar with}} the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball. Before his debut with the Phoenix Suns, the Gorilla delivered singing telegrams. However, in 1980 the Gorilla's fate changed when he stepped onto the court during a game and surprised unsuspecting players and fans.

Since then, the gorilla, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter. The Gorilla would do a few push-ups on the court, then head off in a quest to climb the stairs of both the lower and upper level of the Coliseum to get to the top. When he reached the base of the upper level, he’d stop for a second <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> the applause, then head to the top of the building. When he got there, the crowd would explode.

The Gorilla just wants to have fun, and wants the rest of us to have fun with him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} the special F 4 and R 4 in the {{effective}} action for the Spin(32) /Z 2 and type II strings {{shed some light on}} D-brane calculus and on instanton contributions counting. The D-instanton case is discussed separately. Computations of non-perturbative contributions is still a difficult task. In (supersymmetric) Field theory a direct computation requires the construction of the measure of integration over vacua containing n-instantons, which is not yet available for every n. The use of dualities is still the main tool for getting the answer. In String theory the D-instantons contributions for the R 4 were conjectured thanks to the Sl(2,Z) invariance of the type IIb theory [1], and for the Spin(32) /Z 2 some ad hoc rules for the contributions for the R 4 and F 4 were derived from the S-duality relation between the Heterotic and Type I strings [2]. In this proceeding I will explain how these non-perturbative contributions can be computed exactly, concentrating on the eight-dimensional case. Details and generalizations will be found in [3]. On the heterotic side the F 4 and R 4 terms are extracted from the fourth point amplitude on the torus involving four gauge bosons. In order to get a non zero contribution, eight fermionic zero modes have <b>to</b> be <b>soaked</b> <b>up.</b> So all the fermionic zero modes from the supersymmetric side of the vertex operators have to be saturated, leaving a complete freedom on the nonsupersymmetrical current algebra side. These contributions involve only states belonging to the short multiplets of the N 4 d = 4 supersymmetry algebra [4]. The non-perturbative contributions in eight-dimensions read...|$|R
