40|$|The problem studied {{was whether}} {{supervisors}} evaluated telecommuters differently than their on-site co-workers and, if they did, was this difference explainable by the models on performance ratings by Landy and Farr (1980, 1983, 1989) ? For this study, telecommuting referred to {{employees who are}} full-time employees, but work off-site using electronic communication devices and telecommuted {{at least one day}} per week. Twenty organizations nation-wide were surveyed. Hypotheses stated that {{there was no difference in}} supervisory performance appraisal criteria, supervisory performance ratings whether the supervisor selected employees to telecommute or the supervisor telecommuted or not, and the frequency between formal performance appraisals for <b>telecommuters</b> <b>and</b> non-telecommuters. Performance appraisal criteria and other questions concerning the evaluation process were analyzed. The data supported the first hypothesis of no difference in performance appraisal criteria used to evaluate <b>telecommuters</b> <b>and</b> non-telecommuters. The second hypothesis was not supported by the data. The three groups disagreed that telecommuters were generally better performers than their on-site co-workers. Supervisors <b>and</b> <b>telecommuters</b> disagreed on their perceptions of telecommuters as rated as better employees. It was assumed in the third hypothesis that supervisors who themselves telecommuted would not rate telecommuters as better employees than their co-workers. Due to the small sample size, the results were inconclusive. In the fourth hypothesis, it was assumed that supervisors who had the final say about who would be eligible to telecommute would not perceive telecommuters as better employees. Based on the analysis, the hypothesis could not be supported or refuted due to the small sample size. Finally, the fifth hypothesis relied on measuring the number of months between formal reviews to determine if telecommuters were evaluated more frequently than their onsi te co-workers. The analysis verified that there was no difference between the two groups. Because no prior research has been conducted about differences in evaluating telecommuting and nontelecommuting employees, there is no data available for comparison purposes to discover any trends or changes. Future research on this subject should include a review of actual performance appraisal records to determine if differences in ratings for <b>telecommuters</b> <b>and</b> nontelecommuters exists...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{structures}} of the neutrino flavor mixing matrix focusing on the neutrino oscillations at CHORUS <b>and</b> <b>NOMAD</b> {{as well as the}} one at LSND(or KAR-MEN). We have assumed two typical neutrino mass hierarchies m 3 ≃ m 2 ≫ m 1 and m 3 ≫ m 2 ≫ m 1 (or ≃ m 1). Taking into account the see-saw mechanism of neutrino masses, the reasonable neutrino flavor mixing patterns have been discussed. The observation of the neutrino oscillation at CHORUS <b>and</b> <b>NOMAD</b> presents us the important constraint for the structure of the neutrino flavor mixing matrix.

40|$|Livelihoods {{of farmers}} <b>and</b> <b>nomads</b> in Tibetan Plateau are {{severely}} affected by grassland and herbal resources degeneration. How {{to help them}} achieve livelihood diversification is a key sustainable development issue. This paper examines livelihood assets, livelihood diversification level and livelihood strategies of farmers <b>and</b> <b>nomads</b> in 3 regions of eastern transect in Tibetan Plateau. The results show that livelihood diversification is a popular strategy. From high mountain gorge region to mountain plateau region and plateau region, livelihood diversification level is reduced, and livelihood activities and proportion of extended livelihood also decrease. Livelihood assets and livelihood diversification level decrease {{with the increase of}} elevation, mainly shown in human assets and natural assets. Livelihood diversification level is highly correlative with livelihood assets, mainly shown in natural assets, human assets and social assets. Livelihood improvement strategies of farmers <b>and</b> <b>nomads</b> are still based on existing livelihood assets, mainly raising livestock and digging herbs, and less farmers <b>and</b> <b>nomads</b> consider off-farm employment or doing business. Nomads in plateau region should learn much from experiences of extended livelihoods of people in high mountain gorge region and mountain plateau region. Therefore, aids of governments should focus on relieving restricted factors of livelihood diversification and help them improve their abilities to build up extended type livelihoods...|$|R

This 1 -year study incorporated a within- and between-subjects examination of 527 employees across 3 locations of a large organization. Results showed much higher <b>telecommuter</b> acceptance <b>and</b> use of the virtual-reality system.
