The Foxfire Fund contributed to such development. During the late 1960s through the 1980s, the success of Foxfire inspired many United States schools to develop similar programs. By 1998, it had been adopted by 37 school systems. The Foxfire Fund started offering teacher training programs to support such efforts.|$|R
30|$|Drawing on a {{synthesis}} of Halliday’s [2] triad construct of context of situation in systemic functional linguistics and Douglas’ [3] construct of discourse domain as a theoretical framework alongside the Specification of Generic (Foundation) Competencies (English) (SGC) [4], the analysis found that the numerous specific communicative events (when studied {{in conjunction with the}} contextual details) derived from the data, such as replying to email/telephone enquiries, handling complaints, writing reports and proposals, taking part in discussions and meetings/negotiations, giving presentations, etc., are of various levels of complexity and familiarity and require language output of different levels of sophistication. Upon systematically mapping these real-life workplace communication tasks with the corresponding units of competency (UoCs) in the SGC according to the language skills/competency elements involved and the QF levels into which these tasks fit, the majority of these communicative events were found to cluster around those UoCs that are covered in the <b>English</b> curricula <b>of</b> the various VTC programs. This lends substantial empirical support for <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> these <b>English</b> modules to the generic language competencies needed in the actual workplace.|$|R

Adopting the view of gender as “a system of social relationships and discursive practices” (Norton & Pavlenko, 2004, p. 504), social context is fundamental in understanding how gender relates to foreign language learning. This qualitative study focused {{on the extent to}} which gender impacts English language learning and English language use in the context of teaching English as a foreign language in South Korea. More specifically, it investigates how gender shapes self and social identity, and how these identities relate to English language learning and English language use, at present and/or in the future, in both real and/or imagined communities. Four male and four female participants were selected using purposive homogenous sampling techniques based on the criteria of having lived abroad in an English speaking community for over 5 years—a criterion which assumes the formation of self and social identity in addition to their native Korean L 1.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the Relevance Feedback (RF) process, and the {{scenario}} considered {{is that of a}} Portuguese-English Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CUR) system. CUR deals with the retrieval of documents in one natural language in response to a query expressed in another language. RF is an automatic process for query reformulation. The idea behind it is that users are unlikely to produce perfect queries, especially if given just one attempt. The process aims at improving the queryspecification, which will lead to more relevant documents being retrieved. The method consists of asking the user to analyse an initial sample of documents retrieved in response to a query and judge them for relevance. In that context, two main questions were posed. The first one relates to the user's ability in assessing the relevance of texts in a foreign language, texts hand translated into their language and texts automatically translated into their language. The second question concerns the relationship between the accuracy of the participant's judgements and the improvement achieved through the RF process. In order to answer those questions, this work performed an experiment in which Portuguese speakers were asked to judge <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> documents, documents hand-translated to Portuguese, and documents automatically translated to Portuguese. The results show that machine translation is as effective as hand translation in aiding users to assess relevance. In addition, the impact of misjudged documents on the performance of RF is overall just moderate, and varies greatly for different query topics. This work advances the existing research on RF by considering a CUR scenario and carrying out user experiments, which analyse aspects of RF and CUR that remained unexplored until now. The contributions of this work also include: the investigation of CUR using a new language pair; the design and implementation of a stemming algorithm for Portuguese; and the carrying out of several experiments using Latent Semantic Indexing which contribute data points to the CUR theory...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of curriculum in education is uncontested. Nevertheless, {{this has not}} translated into a thorough examination {{of what constitutes a}} ‘quality’ curriculum. Extant educational quality models mostly investigated ‘quality’ from students’ perspective and were predominantly conducted in the business and engineering fields. Some of these models encompass curriculum quality dimensions, nonetheless, given their focus on student perspectives, emerging curriculum themes were limited to issues of interest to students only, such as the number of courses, and the courses enhancing students’ job perspectives. To date, only a few studies pertaining to quality and service quality have been conducted in the field <b>of</b> Teaching <b>English</b> to Speakers <b>of</b> Other Languages. Thus, this exploratory sequential mixed-methods case study was conducted in an English for Academic Purposes programme in the State of Qatar to uncover teachers’ perceptions of curriculum quality and its attributes. Additionally, this study seeks to discover whether teachers’ perceptions of ‘quality’ affected their curriculum implementation. Qualitative data indicates that participants understood a quality curriculum as one that meets stakeholders’ needs in addition to meeting twenty-five attributes pertaining to curriculum design, course content, and resources. The findings reveal that curriculum design is {{the most important aspect of}} quality followed by course content and resources. Qualitative data also revealed that the exclusion of teachers from curriculum decision-making, students’ admission criteria, and lack of trust were detrimental to the quality of curriculum design. Curriculum relevance to students is of concern to some participants, since students and the wider community do not perceive the English for Academic Purposes courses as relevant. Although the participants’ do not deem quality of resources as an essential attribute of curriculum quality, it affects their curriculum implementation. Overall, the quantitative data supports the qualitative findings with respect to the {{importance of}} the curriculum quality attributes. Two curriculum quality attributes emerge from two participants’ comments related to curriculum design section in the questionnaire. Based on the study findings, it is recommended that the needs and situation analyses be modified at the study site to address concerns raised by the participants. It is also suggested that the university explores different options <b>of</b> <b>English</b> for Academic Purpose programmes to enhance students’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> for Academic Purposes courses...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} motivation, anxiety, global awareness, and linguistic confidence, and {{their relation to}} language test performance {{within the context of}} Chinese university students taking the College English Test Band 4 (CET- 4) in China. Using a mixed methods approach, through survey and interview inquiries, this study explored whether and how the selected psychological factors contributed to students’ CET performance. Results from exploratory factor analysis revealed that Chinese university students displayed three types of instrumental motivation (i. e., mark orientation, further-education orientation, and job orientation), two types of anxiety (i. e., language anxiety and test anxiety), and two types of confidence (i. e., linguistic confidence and test confidence). The results of confirmatory factor analysis led to a modified socio-educational model of motivation with some context-specific concepts (i. e., new instrumental orientations, global awareness, and linguistic confidence) that more accurately represented the characteristics of the Chinese university students. The results of structural equation modelling confirmed that attitude toward the learning situation and integrative orientation were two strong indicators of motivation, which in turn influenced language achievement and confidence. The negative impact of anxiety on language achievement was confirmed. Certain group differences were found in comparing male students with female students, high achievers with low achievers, students from the Arts programs with those from the Science programs, and students who started to learn English before Grade 7 with those iii who did so after Grade 7. The interview findings indicated stronger instrumental orientations than integrative orientations. External influences, including influences from society, teachers, and peers, were also identified. Students expressed their mixed feelings toward the CET- 4, indicating that this test had both positive and negative influences in promoting their English learning. Testing well-developed motivation and anxiety models in the Chinese context enriched and expanded our knowledge in theory development in English language education in China. The implications of this study point to the importance of understanding language test-takers’ characteristics in their macro and micro learning contexts, as well as the importance of establishing <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> language learning to language teaching, and testing in English as Foreign Language contexts...|$|E

40|$|It is trite law that, {{upon the}} grant of a {{pastoral}} lease which is {{indistinguishable from the}} pastoral leases examined in Wik, the Crown does not acquire a beneficial reversionary interest, {{with the result that}} the underlying title of the Crown continues to be mere radical title. This does not, however, resolve the legal position with respect to other leases: in particular, the Wik High Court {{made it clear that the}} pastoral leases in question were not leases in the common law sense. This two-part article, therefore, examines the legal implications of the High Court’s treatment of the reversion expectant argument for common law leases. Although the High Court’s decision in Ward has confirmed that, as a result of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), the grant of such leases extinguish native title, does this necessarily mean that any residuary rights to the land in respect of which the lease was granted automatically lie with the Crown? Part I begins by examining whether, on general principles, the High Court’s identification of radical title as both a postulate of the doctrine of tenure and a concomitant of sovereignty support or undermine Brennan J’s reversion expectant dictum. <b>The</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>English</b> interpretations in determining the meaning of radical title and reversion expectant, in light of Brennan J’s dictum, is also analysed. In Part II it will be seen that the rationales underlying the majority judgments in Wik indicate how the legal implications, for the Crown’s title, of the statutory grant of interests in land other than pastoral leases, including the grant of a true common law lease, might be resolved. The question examined in Part II is twofold: does the Crown grant of a common law lease based upon its radical title mean that the Crown acquires the reversion expectant on the expiry of the term? And, if it does, is such reversion expectant sufficient to convert the Crown’s radical title into beneficial ownership of the land? Put another way, is the traditional common law definition of ‘reversion’ relevant when a lease is granted out of land in respect of which the Crown has mere radical title? Further light is thrown on this question by examining the common law doctrine of extinguishment by freehold grant and the common law concepts of partial extinguishment and suspension...|$|R

The four major findings in this research are as follows. First, the changes in earnings are consistently value-relevant over the sample periods (through March 1979 to March 2000) across almost all industries. We cannot find the evidence that the bubble economy nor the following recession diminishes <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> earnings. Second, there is an asymmetric relation between <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> increase and decrease in earnings. However, the latter is not always transitory and less value-relevant than the former. Contrarily, the decreases in earnings seem to be more persistent and persuasive during the recent depression in Japan. Third, while <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> ordinary income levels is consistently related to <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> changes in ordinary income, we cannot find the systematic relation between <b>the</b> <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> levels and changes as to operating profits and net income.
