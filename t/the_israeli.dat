5|$|Initially, the {{governing}} power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which {{spoke of a}} great victory by the Arab Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> press stressed that {{the aim of the}} operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for the Arab side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> side.|$|E

50|$|Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> {{broke through}} to the Jerusalem-Ramallah road. At Tel al-Ful, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> fought a running battle with up to thirty Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians stalled the advance and {{destroyed}} a number of half-tracks, but <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> launched air attacks and exploited {{the vulnerability of the}} external fuel tanks mounted on the Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians lost half their tanks, and retreated towards Jericho. Joining up with the 4th Brigade, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> then descended through Shuafat and the site of what is now French Hill, through Jordanian defenses at Mivtar, emerging at Ammunition Hill.|$|R
50|$|In late 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> who had {{pilots in}} France testing the aircraft, {{requested}} that the aircraft be transferred to Corsica, in theory {{to allow them to}} continue flight training during the winter.

5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> who suffered heavy losses. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering {{from a lack of}} infantry, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> Defense Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) {{moves to}} {{a house on the}} border between Israel and the West Bank, with the {{building}} sitting on <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> side just next to the dividing line. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, {{as a threat to the}} minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E

50|$|The dispute began {{around noon}} on 3 August 2010 when Israeli forces began {{to dig up}} a tree at the border between Misgav Am, Israel and Adaisseh, Lebanon. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon had given <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> {{permission}} to do the maintenance. The Lebanese claimed <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> had crossed border in conducting this work. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> disputed this claim, and the UN Peacekeeping force also dismissed the border crossing claim. Lebanese sniper fire ensued. Both sides agree that the Lebanese issued a verbal warning prior to the shooting and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> stood their ground and claimed they were on Israeli territory. After an Israeli reserve lieutenant colonel was killed and a captain was shot and injured, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> responded to <b>the</b> sniper fire from the Lebanese side of the border. UN forces intervened to bring {{a halt to the}} armed conflict. Reporters Without Borders said <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> wanted to install a surveillance camera {{on the site of the}} tree. This was the first armed incident since 2006 Lebanon War and a violation of the UN Resolution 1701 to prevent further conflict.|$|R
25|$|In <b>the</b> center, <b>Israeli</b> {{forces were}} ambushed by the Syrians as they {{approached}} Ain Zhalta, and we're pinned down by Syrian forces firing from superior positions. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> were bogged down, and an infantry battalion was sent in by helicopter to reinforce them. The town was only captured after a two-day armored and infantry battle. After Ain Zhalta fell, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> advanced to <b>the</b> town of Ain Dara, which overlooked the Beirut-Damascus highway, and captured the heights overlooking the town. Along the road to Ain Dara, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> encountered Syrian tank and commando units, and found themselves bogged down as the Syrians took advantage of <b>the</b> terrain. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> called in air support, and attack helicopters that took advantage of ravines to fly in low beneath their targets to gain an element of surprise, which proved particularly effective against Syrian tanks.

2500|$|After the {{approval}} for Operation Opera, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> began to plan their mission against Osirak. The basic procedure for the airstrike had been formulated {{as early as}} 1979. [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> needed photographic intelligence about {{the layout of the}} plant. That task allegedly fell to the Iranians. Rather than carrying out a follow up air raid after their September attack, on November 30, 1980, an Iranian F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet took pictures of the Osirak reactor. The photographs were allegedly placed in a top-secret metal container, and certain elements of the Iranian military delivered them to <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> With these photographs, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> began to plan out Operation Opera.|$|R

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the signing}} of the Oslo Accords in 1993, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> and Palestinians have {{embarked}} upon a difficult path to share their joint water resources. Despite international efforts to encourage joint technical projects and institution building, obtacles remain for obtaining a comprehensive water agreement. This paper explicates the main problems hindering water cooperation. It examines the different bargaining positions of <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> and <b>the</b> Palestinians in the water negotiations. Both <b>the</b> Palestinian and <b>Israeli</b> publics have different perceptions regarding the way the water issue should be resolved. For example, the Palestinians tend to focus on the issue of water rights and compensation for water used by <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> during <b>the</b> occupation, and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> instead tend to ignore issues related to international water law and focus on the technical aspects of water sharing. Hence, the difference in perceptions and interpretations of international law influences the nature of any future water agreement...|$|R
