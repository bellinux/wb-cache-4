It affects where and how long people live and work, what kinds of crops are grown, and where they are grown (no part of the country has a year-round growing season). The length and severity of the winter, together with the sharp fluctuations in the mean summer and winter temperatures, impose special requirements on many branches of the economy. In regions of permafrost, buildings must be constructed on pilings, machinery must be made of specially <b>tempered</b> <b>steel,</b> and transportation systems must be engineered to perform reliably in extremely low and extremely high temperatures.

40|$|AbstractThe controlled-forging and controlled-cooling {{has become}} the main process of the non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> now. However, {{there is a problem}} that the {{unstable}} toughness and its lower values restrict the expanded application and the development of the steels. In this study, the process of the non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> was optimized through the micro- alloying and the controlled-forging and controlled-cooling technology. The simulated rapid cooling followed by self tempering after forging was tried to control the microstructure and mechanical properties of the steels. A new process of the non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> was proposed to ensure high strength and high toughness for the studied steels. The toughening and strengthening mechanism of the steels processed by the new process was discussed and evaluated, which could provide the fundamental theory, technical support and process parameters for the industrialized production of the high strength and high toughness non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Trolling is {{a fishing}} method of casting the lure or bait {{to the side}} of, or behind, a moving boat, and letting {{the motion of the}} boat pull the bait through the water. In theory, for light and medium {{freshwater}} gamefishing, any casting or spinning rod (with the possible exception of ultralight rods) can be used for trolling. In the last 30 years, most manufacturers have developed a complete line of generally long, heavily built rods sold as [...] "Trolling Rods", and aimed generally at ocean anglers and Great Lakes salmon and steelhead fishermen. A rod effective for trolling should have relatively fast action, as a very [...] "whippy" [...] slow action rod is extremely frustrating to troll with, and a fast action (fairly stiff) rod is generally much easier to work with when fishing by this method. Perhaps the extreme in this philosophy was reached during the 1940s and early 1950s, when the now-defunct True Temper corporation – a maker of garden tools – marketed a line of trolling rods of 4.5 to 5ft length made of <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> which were square in cross section. They acted as excellent trolling rods, though the action was much too stiff for sportsmanlike playing of fish once hooked. As Great Lakes sportfishing in particular becomes more popular with each passing year, all rod manufacturers continue to expand their lines of dedicated [...] "trolling" [...] rods, though as noted, for most inland lake and stream fishing, a good casting or spinning rod is perfectly adequate for trolling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} {{results on the}} fatigue damage of grade SAE 318 LN austenitic-ferritic duplex steel and a modified SAE 4150 <b>tempering</b> <b>steel</b> in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the relation- ship between the crystallographic orientation of individual grains and grain patches that exhibit slip band formation, fatigue crack initiation and growth. Therefore, electrolytically polished bulk specimens have been fatigued under fully reversed loading in an ultrasonic fatigue testing machine while the surface has been observed in-situ by an optical microscope. The specimens were carefully analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with automated electron back-scatter dif- fraction (EBSD). In case of the austenitic-ferritic duplex steel under VHCF loading conditions, slip band formation is limited to the softer austenite grains. Once being formed, the bands generate high stress concentrations where they impinge the austenite- ferrite (γ−α) phase boundaries, eventually, leading to the crack initiation. In case of the <b>tempering</b> <b>steel</b> crack initiation is caused by slip band formation within the martensitic laths structure. It was found that in both materials microcracks are sensitive to changing crystallographic orientations when crossing a grain or phase boundary...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{classical}} quenched and <b>tempered</b> (QT) <b>steels</b> have been progressively substituted for economically superior vanadium microalloyed steels with medium carbon content which are continuous cooled from the forging temperature. However, these steels perform comparably weak {{in terms of}} 0, 2 %-proof stress and ductility. A new post forging treatment has been developed therefore and proves a promising alternative to the continuous cooling of microalloyed steels with medium carbon content. The treatment consists of a two-step cooling process (slow-fast-cooling) and a subsequent annealing procedure at lower temperatures. The resulting mechanical properties compare to those of chromium-alloyed quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels.</b> The present paper {{is focused on the}} development of the complex microstructure during the thermomechanical treatment with the continuous cooling and the new two-step cooling followed by annealing.

40|$|Demands {{placed on}} modern steels mean that higher {{strengths}} are being sought while alloy contents, particularly carbon, are decreased. These two conflicting requirements have forced steel designers to consider micro-alloying, heat treatment and precipitation strengthening to meet market demands. This study {{concentrated on the}} use of precipitation hardening by copper to maintain the strength of reduced carbon, quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels.</b> Many studies have concentrated on copper proportions above 1 % in as rolled steels. It was the intent of this study to examine the effect of copper levels between 0 and 1 % {{in the development of a}} low carbon, 690 MPa yield strength quenched and <b>tempered</b> structural <b>steel.</b> The changes in hardness upon tempering, tensile testing, Charpy v-notch impact testing, Jominy hardenability, bead-on-plate weld testing and optical microscopy were used to evaluate the steels. Also covered was the development of empirical descriptions of the response of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> to heat treatment. Both copper free and copper containing steels were used in the analysis. In studying the copper containing steels, precipitation hardening was observed in a steel containing 0. 4 % copper (nominal composition). It was shown that the strength and fracture toughness targets of military and commercial specifications can be met by the steels developed. As a result of copper based precipitation hardening, Jominy hardenability tests showed a hardenability much higher than would be predicted on the basis of carbon content and the volume fraction of martensite produced as a function of cooling rate. It was demonstrated that the weldability of the low carbon copper steels, as assessed by the bead on plate test, is superior to that of currently used alloys. Therefore, the aim of maintaining strength and increasing weldability by reducing carbon content was clearly achieved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMicro-alloyed (MA) forging steels are {{becoming}} increasingly important economic alternative to the traditional quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels.</b> MA steels do not require heat treatment after they are shaped into parts, as the required mechanical properties are obtained directly {{at the end of}} the process and save the cost and energy by reducing the number of operations.

These beneficial properties have been achieved by a careful control of chemical composition and by adopting suitably controlled thermo- mechanical processes. In this study, hot compression test on a medium carbon vanadium micro-alloyed steel grade 38 MnVS 6 has been performed on Gleeble-Thermo mechanical Simulator (TMS) in order to study the effect of forging temperature and strain rate on flow stress.
