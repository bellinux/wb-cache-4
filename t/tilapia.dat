40|$|The {{fisheries}} of Lake Kainji, Nigeria, {{experienced a}} boom year following impoundment, then decline post impoundment {{and now is}} {{in a period of}} stabilisation of the fish resources. Several reasons have been advanced on factors responsible for these changes, but two outstanding factors are those of nutritional status and fishing methods of the lake. Two important fish families however continue to dominate the lake fisheries in daily fisherman catches: Clupeidae and Cichlidae (<b>tilapias).</b> Recent studies have also shown that the dominance of the <b>tilapias</b> and clupeids {{is an important factor in}} the understanding of the stability of fisheries of Lake Kainji. One area which has remained undiscussed concerns the parasites and non-fish predators of <b>tilapias</b> which can affect the population dynamics of <b>tilapias.</b> This paper examines therefore some aspects of the fisheries of Lake Kainji and the potential roles that parasites and non-fish predators of <b>tilapias</b> can contribute in developing strategies for consideration in the sustainable management of the fisherie...|$|R
40|$|The {{culture of}} <b>tilapias</b> is an {{important}} industry in most aquaculture producing countries in theworld. Due to the many favorable attributes of this species of fish, including tolerance to wide range ofenvironmental conditions and fast growth rates, interest in its culture is increasing at a rapid pace. Therehave been research initiatives on breeding, genetic improvement and stock manipulation in order toincrease the resistance of this fish to high salinity levels, enabling them to thrive in brackishwater andalmost seawater conditions. Saline-tolerant <b>tilapias</b> have been co-cultured with shrimp in brackishwaterponds as {{it was believed that}} <b>tilapias</b> are able to inhibit the occurrence of luminous vibriosis in ponds.

5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including <b>tilapia</b> (genus Oreochromis and <b>Tilapia),</b> rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

5000|$|Mozambique <b>tilapias</b> often {{travel in}} groups where a strict {{dominance}} hierarchy is maintained. Positions within the hierarchy correlate with territoriality, courtship rate, nest size, aggression, and hormone production. [...] In {{terms of social}} structure, Mozambique <b>tilapias</b> engage in a system known as lek-breeding, where males establish territories with dominance hierarchies while females travel between them. Social hierarchies typically develop because of competition for limited resources including food, territories, or mates. During the breeding season, males cluster around certain territory, forming a dense aggregation in shallow water. [...] This aggregation forms {{the basis of the}} lek through which the females preferentially choose their mates. Reproductive success by males within the lek is highly correlated to social status and dominance. [...] In experiments with captive <b>tilapias,</b> evidence demonstrates the formation of linear hierarchies where the alpha male participates in significantly more agonistic interactions. Thus, males that are higher ranked initiate much more aggressive acts than subordinate males. However, contrary to popular belief, Mozambique <b>tilapias</b> display more agonistic interactions towards fish that are farther apart in the hierarchy scale than they do towards individuals closer in rank. One hypothesis behind this action rests with the fact that aggressive actions are costly. In this context, members of this social system tend to avoid confrontations with neighboring ranks in order to conserve resources rather than engage in an unclear and risky fight. Instead, dominant individuals seek to bully subordinate <b>tilapias</b> both for an easy fight and to keep their rank.|$|R

5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, <b>tilapia,</b> European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of <b>tilapia</b> in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, <b>tilapia,</b> oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, Mozambique <b>tilapias,</b> {{like all}} species {{belonging}} to the Oreochromis genus and species like Astatotilapia burtoni, are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning that spawn is incubated {{and raised in the}} mouth of the mother. Parental care is therefore almost exclusive to the female. Males do contribute by providing nests for the spawn before incubation, but the energy costs associated with nest production is low relative to mouthbrooding. Compared to non-mouthbrooders, it is not energetically feasible to both mouthbrood and grow a new clutch of eggs. Thus, Mozambique <b>tilapias</b> arrest oocyte growth during mouthbrooding to conserve energy. [...] Even with oocyte arrest, females that mouthbrood take significant costs in body weight, energy, and low fitness. Hence, parental-offspring conflict is visible through the costs and benefits to the parents and the young. A mother caring for her offspring carries the cost of reducing her own individual fitness. Unlike most fish, Mozambique <b>tilapias</b> exhibit an extended maternal care period believed to allow social bonds to be formed.|$|R

5|$|In the 1980s, a purported {{new species}} of Streptococcus, named S.shiloi, was {{identified}} {{as one of the}} causes of an epidemic of meningoencephalitis (an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes) affecting farmed rainbow trout and <b>tilapia</b> in Israel since 1986.

In 1995, S.shiloi was found in fact to be beta-hemolytic, and after DNA-DNA hybridization techniques with the ATCC type S.iniae and recalculation of the G+C% content, was reclassified by the same group as a junior synonym of S.iniae.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans.

The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole <b>tilapia,</b> and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly <b>tilapia)</b> before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, <b>tilapia</b> is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange.
