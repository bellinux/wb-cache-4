25|$|A {{contract}} {{arises when}} <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> {{that there is}} an agreement. Formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each party to a contract must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.|$|E
25|$|Procedure {{before the}} ECJ is {{determined}} by its own rules of procedure. As a rule the Court's procedure includes a written phase and an oral phase. The proceedings are conducted {{in one of the}} official languages of the European Union chosen by the applicant, although where the defendant is a member state or a national of a member state the applicant must choose an official language of that member state, unless <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> otherwise.|$|E

25|$|A hung {{parliament}} {{may also}} lead {{to the formation of}} a coalition government in which two or more parties negotiate a joint programme to command a majority in the Commons. Coalitions have also been formed during times of national crisis such as war. Under such circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> to temporarily set aside their political differences and to unite to face the national crisis. Coalitions are rare: since 1721, there have been fewer than a dozen.|$|E
25|$|When {{the parties}} have {{reciprocally}} declared their concordant intent, either expressly or impliedly, a contract shall be constituted. If <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> on all the essential elements of the contract but have expressed no intent as to the non-essential elements, the contract shall be presumed to be constituted. In {{the absence of an}} agreement on the above-mentioned non-essential elements, the court shall decide them according {{to the nature of the}} affair. When one of the parties to a contract receives earnest money from the other, the contract is presumed to be constituted.|$|E
25|$|Arbitration can {{be either}} {{voluntary}} or mandatory (although mandatory arbitration can only come from a statute or from a contract that is voluntarily entered into, in which <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> to hold all existing or future disputes to arbitration, without necessarily knowing, specifically, what disputes will ever occur) and {{can be either}} binding or non-binding. Non-binding arbitration is similar to mediation in that a decision cannot be imposed on the parties. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground on which to compromise, the (non-binding) arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, {{an indication of the}} quantum of damages payable. By one definition arbitration is binding and non-binding arbitration is therefore technically not arbitration.|$|E

25|$|The {{liability}} {{limit of}} the owner's policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As {{with other types of}} insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the policy may be paid by the seller or buyer as <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree.</b> Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should inquire about the cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, escrow officer (in the western states), or loan officer can provide detailed information as to the price of title search and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no additional premium is paid after the policy is issued.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{securities}} industry, arbitration {{has long}} been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms, other than Securities class action claims, are resolved in arbitration. The SEC has come under fire from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for not fulfilling statutory duty to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues. The final result in the case where the arbitrators were in contempt of court is unknown; it was settled out of court under settlement agreement terms that, at the broker's insistence, are confidential.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Brownlee was {{embroiled in}} a sex scandal, with major {{consequences}} to his political career. [...] Those involved with the scandal gave widely disparate accounts of the surrounding facts; on {{only a minority of}} details did <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree.</b> [...] In 1930, Brownlee visited Edson while campaigning in the 1930 provincial election. [...] While there, Allan MacMillan—the mayor of Edson and a political ally of Brownlee's—took him to a farmers' picnic. [...] On the way to the event, Brownlee chatted with MacMillan's daughter, Vivian, then seventeen years old and unsure as to her future. [...] The premier encouraged her to come to Edmonton and study business at Alberta College. [...] She did so and, after graduating in June 1931, started working {{in the office of the}} provincial Attorney-General as a stenographer on July3.|$|E

2500|$|In finance, a futures {{contract}} (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized forward contract, a legal agreement {{to buy or}} sell [...] something at a predetermined price at a specified time [...] in the future. The asset transacted is usually a commodity or financial instrument and the transaction is usually done on the trading floor of a futures exchange. [...] The predetermined price <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> to buy and sell the asset for [...] is known as the forward price. The specified time in the future -- which is when delivery and payment occur -- is known as the delivery date. Because it is a function of an underlying asset, a {{futures contract}} is a derivative product.|$|E
2500|$|LG Electronics (LGE) owned several patents on {{methods and}} systems for {{processing}} information. It entered into two contracts with Intel. In the License Agreement, LGE authorized Intel {{to make and}} sell microprocessor products using the patented inventions. Moreover, the License Agreement expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products (for example, for combining Intel microprocessor products with other parts of a computer). The License Agreement also provided, however, “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” ...|$|E
2500|$|TBAs—short for [...] "to-be-announced" [...] securities—involve {{a special}} type of trading of mortgage-backed securities. TBAs {{are the most}} liquid and {{important}} secondary mortgage market, with volume in the trillions of dollars annually. TBAs are traded by MBS traders with notional amounts. There are settlement days when the traders have {{to make good on}} their trades. At that time, they choose fractions from various pools to make up their TBA. Only agency mortgage-backed securities trade in the TBA market. [...] "In a TBA transaction, <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> on a price for delivering a given volume of Agency Pass-Through Mortgage-Backed Securities at a specified future date. The distinguishing feature of a TBA transaction is that the actual identity of the securities to be delivered at settlement is not specified on the date of execution (“Trade Date”). Instead, the parties to the trade agree on only five general parameters of the securities to be delivered: issuer, mortgage type, term, coupon, and month of settlement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Included in this {{category}} are bid bonds (guaranty that a contractor will {{enter into a contract}} if awarded the bid); performance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will perform the work as specified by the contract); payment bonds (guaranty that a contractor will pay for services, particularly subcontractors and materials and particularly for federal projects where a mechanic's lien is not available); and maintenance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will provide facility repair and upkeep for a specified period of time). [...] There are also miscellaneous contract bonds that do not fall within the categories above, the most common of which are subdivision and supply bonds. Bonds are typically required for federal government projects by the Miller Act and state projects under [...] "little Miller Acts". In federal government, the contract language is determined by the government. In private contracts the parties may freely contract the language and requirements. Standard form contracts provided by American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) make bonding optional. If <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> to require bonding, additional forms such as the performance bond contract AIA Document 311 provide common terms.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity retailers, who in {{aggregate}} buy from the wholesale market, and generators who {{in aggregate}} {{sell to the}} wholesale market, are exposed to these price and volume effects and {{to protect themselves from}} volatility, they will enter into [...] "hedge contracts" [...] with each other. The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price forward contracts for physical delivery and contracts for differences where <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> a strike price for defined time periods. In the case of a contract for difference, if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the [...] "strike" [...] price, the generator will refund the difference between the [...] "strike" [...] price and the actual price for that period. Similarly a retailer will refund the difference to the generator when the actual price is less than the [...] "strike price". The actual price index is sometimes referred to as the [...] "spot" [...] or [...] "pool" [...] price, depending on the market.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{appears to}} be saying that LGE simply {{licensed}} Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about the absence of a license. But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” [...] LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to go right to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>agree</b> that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” ...|$|E
