On the next Raw, Michaels renounced his retirement and challenged Jericho to an unsanctioned match at Unforgiven, which Jericho accepted. The next week, they had an in-ring contract signing for the unsanctioned match. During this, <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> fight, causing a legit small triceps tear for Michaels. He was medically cleared to compete at Unforgiven, and beat Jericho so severely that the referee called the match. Later that night, Jericho replaced CM Punk in the World Heavyweight Championship scramble match, and won the title. The next month. at No Mercy, Michaels lost a championship ladder match to Jericho.|$|E

In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the refinery changing to Hereaus & Management.

As <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E

Soon after their Sunday Night Heat win, they built up a fan base {{following}} through their high-flying tag team tactics. <b>They</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> become serious contenders for the Tag Team Championship after they became managed by Michael Hayes, formerly a member of The Fabulous Freebirds. On the June 29, 1999, episode of Raw Is War (aired July 5), they defeated The Acolytes (Farooq and Bradshaw) to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship, but they re-lost the title to The Acolytes {{a little less than}} a month later at Fully Loaded.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} of tunnel was {{completed}} in September 1998, and the TBMs moved to Havnegade. By December 1998, work had started on the initial nine stations. Plans for M2 were presented {{to the public in}} April 1999, with a debate emerging if the proposed elevated solution was the best. In May, the first trains were delivered, and trial runs began at the depot. In December, the tunnels were completed to Strandlodsvej, and the TBMs were moved to Havnegade, where <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> grind towards Frederiksberg. From 1 January 2000, the S-train service from Solbjerg to Vanløse was terminated, and work commenced to rebuild the section to metro. The last section of tunnel was completed in February 2001.|$|E
5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. <b>They</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, {{it became clear to}} the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. <b>They</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April a state of emergency was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared, an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E

In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> fill stadium sized venues and bigger, {{they ran into}} {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} stand {{for a few seconds}} before Hughes took him down again. In round two, <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> trade punches, but eventually Hughes took Sherk down. Like the first round, they stood up for a moment. At the beginning of the third round, Sherk took Hughes down, while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|E

In the key word phase <b>they</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> identify and use key content words. For example, to express [...] "I am hungry", they would simply use the key word [...] "hungry". In the sentence phase, children begin to use phrases and complete sentences. There is a long delay from <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> distinguish sounds to being able to use complete sentences.|$|R
5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incarceration of the Thapas, a new {{government}} with joint mukhtiyars was formed with Rangnath Paudel {{as the head of}} civil administration, and Dalbarjan Pande and Ranjang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as mukhtiyar and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole mukhtiyar.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 {{following}} the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{went on a}} hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason. The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 when <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Fruciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. Speculation proved to be true with Frusciante already having quit the band {{for a second time}} on July 29, 2009 however it wasn't until December 2009 in a post on his official website that he made his departure from the band official to the public. He stated that he left Red Hot Chili Peppers during the hiatus to focus on a solo career. Klinghoffer, who acted as a sideman during 2007 dates on the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and on John Frusciante's solo projects, joined the band on October 12, 2009; however, his membership was not announced until February 8, 2010. With Klinghoffer, the band saw this as a new beginning and in August 2011 they released their tenth-studio album, I'm with You. During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.|$|E

5|$|In the 1080s, Sélestat was the {{property}} of Hildegard von Eguisheim, mother of Frederick I, Duke of Swabia, {{the first member of}} the House of Hohenstaufen. Hildegard transformed the place into a religious centre when she founded St. Faith's Church, which she gave to the Benedictines of Conques Abbey. Monks from Conques opened a priory next to the church in 1092. The House of Hohenstaufen quickly became the leading dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, which came to the imperial throne in 1152. Being under their protection, the priory of Sélestat strongly influenced local life. Even though Sélestat constituted a distinct parish, its priest had only limited power and the Benedictine prior was the true head of the municipality. At the end of the 12th century, the Hohenstaufen dynasty gradually lost power and as a result the priory started to decline. The citizens used this opportunity to reduce the prior's dominance and secure the power of their parish. <b>They</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> build a new parish church in the 1220s. St. George's Church was designed in Gothic style and was significantly larger than St. Faith's Church, another way to signify the end of Benedictine hegemony.|$|E
5|$|On 14 January 1882, Maria Deraismes was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry in Loge Libre Penseurs (Freethinkers Lodge), in Le Pecq, just outside Paris. Deraismes was a well known writer and campaigner for democracy, women's rights, and {{the separation of}} church and state. Her lodge, on 9 January, had seceded from la Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise in order to initiate her. She then resigned, to enable her lodge to rejoin their previous jurisdiction. She did, however, persist in her efforts to legitimately become a mason, with the assistance of Doctor Georges Martin, a fellow campaigner for women's rights, and a Freemason. After a decade of trying <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> form their own lodge, and between 1 June 1892 and 4 March 1893, assembled 16 women who wished to become masons. They were initiated as Apprentices on 14 March 1893, Companions on 24 March, and Master Masons on 1 April. This done, on 4 April the now mixed lodge of male and female masons proceeded to elect its officers and constitute itself as La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France, Le Droit Humain, soon to become l’Ordre Maçonnique Mixte International Le Droit Humain. This would flourish as international co-masonry, which Deraismes never lived to see. She died the following February.|$|E
5|$|Scudder escaped and {{encountered}} carnival performer Lodz on the battlefield, {{searching for}} his bear Bruno. When Scudder joined Lodz's troupe, Lodz recognized and cultivated Scudder's supernatural abilities, and <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> perform in the salons of war-torn Europe. Meanwhile, Belyakov slowly recovered from his wounds and learned about his true nature and destiny through devoted study of ancient manuscripts. Scudder could feel Belyakov tracking his movements and never stayed long in one area. Growing impatient, Lodz {{got into a fight}} with Scudder about his skills and was gifted with mindreading in exchange for his sense of sight. Scudder returned to America in 1915 to flee his nightmares. Several months later, Belyakov located the broken-down Lodz in Venice. Belyakov noticed the mental bond between Lodz and Scudder the power transfer had caused, and promised to restore Lodz's sight if he helped in finding Scudder.|$|E
