25|$|Several {{small step}} pyramids along the Nile river are also {{credited}} to Huni. <b>Those</b> <b>small</b> pyramids had a cultic function and marked important royal estates. They contained no internal chambers {{and were not}} used for burial purposes. One of them {{is located at the}} eastern end of Elephantine island and a granite cone with Huni's name was discovered nearby in 1909. Therefore, this little pyramid {{is the only one that}} may be credited to Huni with some certainty. Some scholars such as Andrzej Ćwiek contest this attribution however, pointing out that it might be at least possible that the granite cone of Huni was re-used in later times, when ramesside priests restored cultic places of the Old Kingdom period. The only cultic step pyramid that can be definitively connected to an Old Kingdom ruler is a small step pyramid known as the Seila Pyramid, located at the Faiyum Oasis. Two large stela with the name of Snefru were found in front of the pyramid, thus indicating the king responsible for its construction. Since Snefru was Huni's likely immediate successor, this might indicate however that cultic pyramids were indeed constructed at the transition between the 3rd and 4th dynasties.|$|E

2500|$|The written {{history of}} the Micronesian proa began when it was {{recorded}} after encounter by European explorers in the Micronesian islands. [...] The earliest written accounts were by Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian who was a passenger on Ferdinand Magellan's 1519–1522 circumnavigation. Pigafetta's account of the stop at approximately 146 E, 12 N, (the Mariana Islands, named the Ladrones by Magellan's men), describes the proa's outrigger layout, and ability to switch bow for stern, and also notes the proa's speed and maneuverability, noting, [...] "And although the ships were under full sail, they passed {{between them and the}} small boats (fastened astern), very adroitly in <b>those</b> <b>small</b> boats of theirs." [...] Pigafetta likened the proa to the Venetian fisolere, a narrow variety of gondola; this was an apt comparison due to both the long, thin shape and asymmetric nature of single-oar gondolas.|$|E

[...] Some of these works include his Poems Written Before Jumping Out of an 8 Story Window, published by his friend and fellow poet Charles Potts, and better known works such as Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame. These poems and stories were later republished by Black Sparrow Press (now HarperCollins/ECCO) as collected volumes of his work.|$|E

Grace had {{much to say about}} the state of the grounds in the 1860s and declared that Lord's [...] "was in a very unsatisfactory condition". He added that wickets at The Oval were always much better than at Lord's, where the clay in the soil handicapped the groundsmen. Writing in 1899, Grace recollected that he [...] "could go on to the pitch at Lord's and pick up a handful of small pieces of gravel"; a source of danger as a fast ball hitting one of <b>those</b> <b>small</b> stones would [...] "fly high in the air".|$|E
