2500|$|The Jats are a {{paradigmatic}} {{example of}} community- and identity-formation in early modern Indian subcontinent. [...] "Jat" [...] is an elastic label {{applied to a}} wide-ranging, traditionally non-elite, community which had its origins in pastoralism in the lower Indus valley of Sindh. At the time of Muhammad bin Qasim's conquest of Sind in the 8th century, Arab writers described agglomerations of Jats in the arid, the wet, and the mountainous regions of the conquered land. [...] The new Islamic rulers, though professing a theologically egalitarian religion, did not alter either the non-elite status of Jats or the discriminatory practices against them that had {{been put in place}} in the long period of Hindu rule in Sind. Between the eleventh and the sixteenth centuries, Jat herders migrated up along the river valleys, into the Punjab, which had not been cultivated in the first millennium. Many took up <b>tilling</b> <b>in</b> regions such as Western Punjab, where the sakia (water wheel) had been recently introduced. By early Mughal times, in the Punjab, the term [...] "Jat" [...] had become loosely synonymous with [...] "peasant", and some Jats had come to own land and exert local influence.|$|E

For now their work, however humble, is God's work; Christ has bought it and redeemed it with his blood. When he redeemed human nature, he redeemed all that human nature can and ought to do, save sin. All human duties and occupations are purified by the blood of Christ's cross; and if we do our duty well, we do it to the Lord, and not to man; and the Lord blesses us therein, and will help us to fulfil our work like Christian men, by the help of his Holy Spirit.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tilling</b> <b>in</b> {{absolute}} darkness (night tillage) might {{reduce the}} number of weeds that sprout following the tilling operation by half. Light is necessary to break the dormancy of some weed species' seed, so if fewer seeds are exposed to light during the tilling process, fewer will sprout. This may help reduce the amount of herbicides needed for weed control.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} the first regional statistical analysis of soils developed on <b>till</b> <b>in</b> Northern Ireland, using the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland's Tellus geochemical database. Till geochemistry is largely determined by its parent bedrock and soils developed on tills are known to inherit this geochemical signature. Soil geochemistry from areas of till can therefore be used to establish sediment provenance which in turn provides information on palaeo ice flow directions and ice sheet history. In this study, we use Principal Component Analysis to establish geochemical groupings that can be related back to likely bedrock parent material for the <b>tills</b> <b>in</b> the region. The maps, presented here at 1 : 445, 000 scale, show {{the results of the}} first regional investigation of soil geochemistry of part of the northern sector of the Irish Ice Sheet. The results indicate that the upper surface of the majority of <b>tills</b> <b>in</b> the study area have a close relationship to local bedrock with rapid geochemical changes observed at lithological boundaries. This suggests that <b>tills</b> <b>in</b> this sector of the Irish Ice Sheet are primarily local in origin, indicating rapid entrainment of bedrock and low rates of evacuation of debris to the ice margin. ...|$|R

50|$|John Killefer apprenticed for {{two years}} as a {{blacksmith}} beginning in 1850, then moved to southern California and bought an orange grove. He soon noticed the phenomenon referred to as hardpan (the creation of a water resistant soil layer). Sometime in 1892 he designed and created the chisel plough for land <b>tilling</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent or defeat hardpanning. He founded Killefer Manufacturing Company in 1893 in San Bernardino, California. He relocated his company to Palmetto Street, Los Angeles, California in 1895 in order to lower overhead costs {{for the production of}} his plow. His son took over the company before it was sold to Deere & Company in 1937.|$|E

Holt also produced a short story, Diplomatic Incident, for the former Tilling Society in 1998 and another called Great Minds for the Friends of <b>Tilling</b> <b>in</b> 2006. The Friends of Tilling organise an annual gathering in Rye each September for devotees of Mapp & Lucia and E F Benson's other comic novels. Two other Tilling books, Major Benjy and Au Reservoir, were written by Guy Fraser-Sampson and published by Troubador. In 2014 the BBC made a new three-part series adapted by Steve Pemberton (who also played Georgie Pillson) from the original Mapp and Lucia novel.|$|E

It was said that in his youth, his honesty and willingness to help others made him well known in his home territory. In particular, once, when a man from his county lost his parents but was too poor to give his parents a proper burial, Dou was <b>tilling</b> <b>in</b> the fields, but he dropped his tilling and immediately went to help the man bury his parents, and after this incident he became particularly praised among the people. For a while, he served {{as the leader of the}} neighborhood, but after he was accused of crimes, he fled, returning home only after a general pardon. When his father died, more than a thousand people attended the funeral, and Dou refused all gifts given him for the funeral.|$|E
50|$|Organic {{gardening}} {{is designed}} {{to work with the}} ecological systems and minimally disturb the Earthâs natural balance. Because of this organic farmers have been interested in reduced-tillage methods. Conventional agriculture uses mechanical tillage, which is plowing or sowing, which is harmful to the environment. The impact of <b>tilling</b> <b>in</b> organic farming is much less of an issue. Ploughing speeds up erosion because the soil remains uncovered {{for a long period of}} time and if it has a low content of organic matter the structural stability of the soil decreases. Organic farmers use techniques such as mulching, planting cover crops, and intercropping, to maintain a soil cover throughout most of the year. The use of compost, manure mulch and other organic fertilizers yields a higher organic content of soils on organic farms and helps limit soil degradation and erosion.Other methods can also be used to supplement an existing garden. Methods such as composting, or vermicomposting. These practices are ways of recycling organic matter into some of the best organic fertilizers and soil conditioner. Vermicompost is especially easy. The byproduct is also an excellent source of nutrients for an organic garden.|$|E
