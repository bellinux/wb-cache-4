50|$|The highly {{accurate}} {{terminal guidance}} technique {{used by the}} Pershing II RV was radar area correlation, using a Goodyear Aerospace active radar homing system. This technique compared live radar video return <b>to</b> <b>prestored</b> reference scenes of the target area and determined RV position errors with respect to its trajectory and target location. These position errors updated the inertial guidance system, which in turn sent commands to the vane control system to guide the RV to the target.|$|R
50|$|At a {{predetermined}} altitude above the target, the terminal phase would begin. A velocity control maneuver (pull up, pull down) was executed under inertial guidance control {{to slow down}} the RV and achieve the proper impact velocity. The radar correlator system was activated and the radar scanned the target area. Radar return data was compared <b>to</b> <b>prestored</b> reference data and the resulting position fix information was used to update the inertial guidance system and generate RV steering commands. The RV was then maneuvered to the target by the RV vane control system.|$|R

3000|$|The {{feedback}} {{block was}} developed in MATLAB (Fig.  2). The major function of the feedback loop is to process the camera image of the workspace and output data on the OFB microrobots and the micro-objects under manipulation. The captured image was analyzed by the Hough transform algorithm, providing the microrobot’s locations and sizes, and the micro-object’s locations and sizes. The Hough transform detected the shapes in the image, which were then matched <b>to</b> <b>prestored</b> object data. The image data were converted to grayscale {{and then to a}} binary image using Otsu thresholding [39] to make the image suitable for the Hough transform. Detection of unwanted objects, such as the white circular spot at the center of Microrobot 1 in Fig.  4 a, was reduced by defining the size ranges of the objects to detect. A grasp-planning algorithm was also developed in MATLAB to plan the course, speed, and other microassembly-related parameters for efficient manipulation. Once the microrobot data and micro-object data are available in the MATLAB workspace, the grasp-planning module utilizes user-desired preplanned conditions to calculate the final location of each microrobot for accurate grasping. Once the final destination of each microrobot is calculated, it is saved in a.mat file for subsequent use by the microrobot actuation block. During initiation of the actuation, the destination data from the [...].mat file are loaded into the MathScript module of LabVIEW.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Today, {{there exist}} many {{algorithms}} and protocols for constructing agregation or dissemination trees for {{wireless sensor networks}} that are optimal (for different notions of optimal, i. e. under different cost metrics). However, all these schemes differ from one common failing- they construct an optimal tree for a given fixed subset of the sensors. In most practical scenarios, the sensor group is continuously and dynamically varying- consider for example the set of sensors scattered in a forest that are sensing temperatures above some specified threshold, during a wildfire. Given the limited computational and energy resources of sensor nodes it is impossible <b>to</b> either <b>prestore</b> the optimal tree for every conceivable group or to dynamically generate them on the fly. In this paper we propose the novel approach of constructing a single group-independent spanning tree (GIST) T for the network and then letting any sensor group S use the subtree induced by S on T, TS as its group aggregation tree. The important question is, how does {{the quality of the}} subtree TS compare to the optimal tree, OP TS, across differen...|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} part of the algorithm is to derive a generalized Gaussian mixture pdf that does not have to adjust to the particular testing music piece. This probabilistic model should be global {{in the sense that it}} will include the statistical properties of all possible audio pieces and both transmitting and receiving ends will have access <b>to</b> it (e.g., <b>prestored</b> in both sides). This does not mean that the mixture pdf will accurately model any of the particular testing music pieces but rather capture the main (subband-specific) statistical properties of the testing source cepstral vectors. In essence, we ensure that the conversion function acquires appropriate mixture model parameters (i.e., cluster means and variances) so that the conversion parameters derivation is not ill-conditioned.|$|R

30|$|As we expected, for RT-Link and S-MAC, the SJ's {{lifetime}} is very high. As shown, RSTDMA {{is easily}} jammed and the SJ enjoys the longest lifetime. In addition, the slot size randomization component decreases the jammer's lifetime, for almost 0.1 years at 50 % CR. Note that differences between LIFE-CR curve for SJ and RJ are caused {{only by the}} fact that SJ does not transmit pulses in intervals smaller than 1 [*]ms, which, in this case, is the smallest slot size (only parameter that can be extracted from input signal statistics). We observe that schedule randomization has a significantly higher impact on the jammer's lifetime than does slot size randomization. This justifies our decision <b>to</b> use a <b>prestored</b> key for the latter's calculations, while using keys from the gateway's one-way chain for former. If some nodes are captured and compromised, only the predefined slot-size key would risk being extracted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Convex {{optimization}} is {{a powerful}} tool for resource allocation and signal processing in wireless networks. As the network density is expected to drastically increase in order to accommodate the exponentially growing mobile data traffic, performance optimization problems are entering a new era characterized by a high dimension and/or a large number of constraints, which poses significant design and computational challenges. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage approach to solve large-scale convex optimization problems for dense wireless cooperative networks, which can effectively detect infeasibility and enjoy modeling flexibility. In the proposed approach, the original large-scale convex problem is transformed into a standard cone programming form in the first stage via matrix stuffing, which only needs to copy the problem parameters such as channel state information (CSI) and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements <b>to</b> the <b>prestored</b> structure of the standard form. The capability of yielding infeasibility certificates and enabling parallel computing is achieved by solving the homogeneous self-dual embedding of the primal-dual pair of the standard form. In the solving stage, the operator splitting method, namely, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), is adopted to solve the large-scale homogeneous self-dual embedding. Compared with second-order methods, ADMM can solve large-scale problems in parallel with modest accuracy within a reasonable amount of time. Simulation results will demonstrate the speedup, scalability, and reliability of the proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art modeling frameworks and solvers.

40|$|The role of {{extracellular}} proteolysis in innate {{and adaptive}} immunity and {{the interplay between}} cytokines, chemokines and proteinases are gradually becoming recognized as critical factors in autoimmune processes. Many of the involved proteinases, {{including those of the}} plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase cascades, and also several cytokines and chemokines, are glycoproteins. The stability, interactions with inhibitors or receptors, and activities of these molecules are fine-controlled by glycosylation. We studied gelatinase B or matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) as a glycosylated enzyme involved in autoimmunity. In the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients, CXC chemokines, such as interleukin- 8 /CXCL 8, recruit and activate neutrophils <b>to</b> secrete <b>prestored</b> neutrophil collagenase/MMP- 8 and gelatinase B/MMP- 9. Gelatinase B potentiates interleukin- 8 at least tenfold and thus enhances neutrophil and lymphocyte influxes to the joints. When cartilage collagen type II is cleaved at a unique site by one of several collagenases (MMP- 1, MMP- 8 or MMP- 13), it becomes a substrate of gelatinase B. Human gelatinase B cleaves the resulting two large collagen fragments into at least 33 peptides of which two {{have been shown to be}} immunodominant, i. e., to elicit activation and proliferation of autoimmune T cells. One of these two remnant epitopes contains a glycan which is important for its immunoreactivity. In addition to the role of gelatinase B as a regulator in adaptive immune processes, we have also demonstrated that it destroys interferon-beta, a typical innate immunity effector molecule and therapeutic cytokine in multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, glycosylated interferon-beta, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, was more resistant to this proteolysis than recombinant interferon-beta from bacteria. These data not only prove that glycosylation of proteins is mechanistically important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, but also show that targeting of glycosylated proteinases or the use of glycosylated cytokines seems also critical for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Vision entails complex {{processes}} to sense, interpret and reason about the external world. The performance of such processes in a dynamic environment {{needs to be}} regulated by flexible and reliable control mechanisms. This thesis is concerned with aspects of control in high level vision. The study of control problems in vision defines a research area which only recently has received adequate attention. Classification criteria such as scope of application, knowledge representation, control structure and communication have been chosen to establish means of comparisons between the existing vision systems. Control problems have recently become of great topical interest {{as a result of}} the basic ideas of the active vision paradigm. The proponents of active vision suggest that robust solutions to vision problems arise when sensing and analysis are controlled (i. e. purposively adjusted) to exploit both data and available knowledge (temporal context). The work reported in this thesis follows the basic tenets of active vision. It is directed at the study of control of sensor gaze, scene interpretation and visual strategy monitoring. Control of the visual sensor is an important aspect of active vision. A vision system must be able to establish its orientation with respect to the partially known environment and have control strategies for selecting targets to be viewed. In this thesis algorithms are implemented for establishing vision system pose relative <b>to</b> <b>prestored</b> environment landmarks and for directing gaze to points defined by objects in an established scene model. Particular emphasis has been placed on accounting for and propagating estimation errors arising from both measured image data and inaccuracy of stored scene knowledge. In order to minimise the effect of such errors a hierarchical scene model has been adopted with contextually related objects grouped together. Object positions are described relative to local determined landmarks and this keeps the size of errors within tolerable bounds. The scene interpretation module takes image descriptions in terms of low level features and produces a symbolic description of the scene in terms of known objects classes and their attributes. The construction of the scene model is an incremental process which is achieved by means of several knowledge sources independently controlled by separate modules. The scene interpreter has been carefully structured and operates in a loop of perception that is controlled by high level commands delivered from the system supervisor module. The individual scene interpreter modules operate as locally controlled modules and are instructed as to what visual task to perform, where to look in the scene and what subset of data to use. The module processing takes into account the existing partial scene interpretation. These mechanisms embody the concepts of spatial focus of attention and exploitation of temporal context. Robust scene interpretation is achieved via temporal integration of the interpretation. The element of control concerned with visual strategy monitoring is at the system supervisor level. The supervisor takes a user given task and decides the best strategy to follow in order to satisfy it. This may involve interrogation of existing knowledge or the initiation of new data collection and analysis. In the case of new analysis the supervisor has to express the task in terms of a set of achievable visual tasks and then these are encoded into a control word which is passed to the scene interpreter. The vocabulary of the scene supervisor includes tasks such as general scene exploration, the finding of a specific object, the monitoring of a specified object, the description of attributes of single objects or relationships between two or more objects. The supervisor has to schedule sub-tasks in such a way as to achieve a good solution to the given problem. A considerable number of experiments, which make use of real and synthetic data, demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach by means of the current implementation (written in C and in the rule based system Clips) ...|$|R
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{localized}} {{throughout the body}} and mediate allergic, immune, and inflammatory reactions. They are heterogeneous, tissue-resident, long-lived, and granulated cells. Mast cells increase their numbers in specific site in the body by proliferation, increased recruitment, increased survival, and increased rate of maturation from its progenitors. Mast cells are implicated in brain injuries, neuropsychiatric disorders, stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Brain mast cells are the first responders before microglia in the brain injuries since mast cells can release prestored mediators. Mast cells also can detect amyloid plaque formation during Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Stress conditions activate mast cells <b>to</b> release <b>prestored</b> and newly synthesized inflammatory mediators and induce increased blood-brain barrier permeability, recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells into the brain and neuroinflammation. Stress induces the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus and mast cells. CRH activates glial cells and mast cells through CRH receptors and releases neuroinflammatory mediators. Stress also increases proinflammatory mediator release in the peripheral systems that can induce and augment neuroinflammation. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a traumatic-chronic stress related mental dysfunction. Currently there is no specific therapy to treat PTSD since its disease mechanisms are not yet clearly understood. Moreover, recent reports indicate that PTSD could induce and augment neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Mast cells {{play a crucial role}} in the peripheral inflammation as well as in neuroinflammation due to brain injuries, stress, depression, and PTSD. Therefore, mast cells activation in brain injury, stress, and PTSD may accelerate the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases including AD. This review focusses on how mast cells in brain injuries, stress, and PTSD may promote the pathogenesis of AD. We suggest that inhibition of mast cells activation and brain cells associated inflammatory pathways in the brain injuries, stress, and PTSD can be explored as a new therapeutic target to delay or prevent the pathogenesis and severity of AD...|$|R
