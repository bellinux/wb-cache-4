40|$|The paper {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} by drying 38 -mm thick beech timber, namely one control <b>test</b> <b>run</b> under usual, conventional drying schedule and four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> dried under the same schedule but with oscillations of equilibrium moisture content. During oscillation drying, temperature curve was identical with the temperature curve in the control <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> and the values of equilibrium moisture content oscillated according to previously set amplitudes and frequencies. Oscillation amplitudes were ± 10 % {{in the first two}} <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and ± 20 % in the second two <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> compared to the value anticipated in the schedule. Duration of each oscillation was 3 h in the first and third <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and 6 h in the second and fourth <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Special addition to the manufacturer’s software was developed for the realization of these oscillations. When comparing the results, drying time (for the same intervals of initial and final timber moisture content), energy consumption and drying quality were taken into consideration. Drying quality was determined {{at the end of each}} <b>test</b> <b>run</b> (both before and after conditioning), and based on the value of final timber moisture content, distribution of moisture content across thickness and gap size. Drying time was shorter in all four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillations, and energy consumption was lower than in the conventional <b>test</b> <b>run.</b> Slightly shorter drying period was recorded in <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillation frequency of 3 hours compared to the <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with 6 hour oscillations. Final timber moisture content was almost even in all <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Profiles of moisture content across timber thickness were also similar in the <b>test</b> <b>runs,</b> but the biggest difference between core and surface at the end of drying was achieved in the <b>test</b> <b>run</b> without oscillations. Before conditioning, average gap value of over 2 mm was recorded in all <b>test</b> <b>runs,</b> but the biggest average value was recorded in the <b>test</b> <b>run</b> without oscillations...|$|R

40|$|Background A {{surgical}} safety checklist (SSC) {{was implemented}} and routinely evaluated within our hos-pital. The {{purpose of this}} study was to analyze compliance, knowledge of and satisfaction with the SSC to determine further improvements. Methods The implementation of the SSC was observed in a pilot unit. After roll-out into each operat-ing theater, compliance with the SSC was routinely measured. To assess subjective and objective knowledge, as well as satisfaction with the SSC implementation, an online survey (N = 891) was performed. Results During two <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> in a piloting unit, 305 operations were observed, 175 in <b>test</b> <b>run</b> 1 and 130 in <b>test</b> <b>run</b> 2.

40|$|N Context. —Before being {{communicated to}} the caregiver, {{critical}} laboratory values are verified by repeat testing to ensure their accuracy and to avoid reporting false or erroneous results. Objective. —To determine whether 2 <b>testing</b> <b>runs</b> offered any advantage over a single testing run in ensuring accuracy or in avoiding the reporting of false or erroneous results. Design. —Within the hematology laboratory, 5 tests were selected: hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time. A minimum of 500 consecutive critical laboratory test values were collected retrospec-tively for each test category. The absolute value {{and the percentage of}} change between the 2 <b>testing</b> <b>runs</b> for each critical value were calculated and averaged for each test category and then compared with our laboratory’s preset, acceptable tolerance limits for reruns. Results. —The mean results obtained for the absolute value and the percentage of change between the <b>testing</b> <b>runs</b> were 0. 08 g/dL (1. 4 %) for hemoglobin levels, 50 cells/mL (10. 2 %) for white blood cell counts, 1500 cells/mL (9. 9 %) for platelet counts, 0. 7 seconds (1. 4 %) for prothrombin time, and 5. 1 seconds (4. 4 %) for activated partial thromboplastin time (all within our laboratory’s acceptable tolerance limits for reruns). The percentage of specimens with an absolute value or a mean percentage of change outside our laboratory’s acceptable tolerance limits for reruns ranged between 0 % and 2. 2 % among the test categories. No false or erroneous results were identified between the 2 <b>testing</b> <b>runs</b> in any category. Conclusions. —Routine, repeat testing of critical hemo-globin level, platelet count, white blood cell count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time results did not offer any advantage over a single run. (Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2011; 135 : 440 – 444) The concept of a critical value as a laboratory result thatreflects a potentially life-threatening emergency was coined by Lundberg in the early 1970 s. 1 Since then, this concept has been adapted by national and state laboratory accreditation and regulatory agencies, such as the Colleg...|$|E

40|$|Context: Routine repeat {{testing of}} {{critical}} values is a long-standing practice in many clinical laboratories; however, its usefulness and necessity {{remain to be}} empirically established and no regulatory requirements yet exist for verification of the critical value results obtained by repeat analysis. Objective: To determine whether repeat testing of critical values is useful and necessary in a clinical chemistry laboratory. Methods: A total of 601 chemistry critical values (potassium, n = 255; sodium, n = 132; calcium, n = 108; glucose, n = 106) obtained from 72, 259 routine clinical chemistry specimens were repeat tested. The absolute value {{and the percentage of}} difference between the two <b>testing</b> <b>runs</b> were calculated {{for each of the four}} critical values and then compared with the allowable error limit put forth in the College of American Pathologists (CAP). Results: Among the repeat data for the 601 critical values, a total of 24 showed large differences between the initial result and the repeated result which exceeded the CAP limits for allowable error. The number and rates (%) of large differences for within and outside the analytical measurement range (AMR) were 12 (2. 1 %) and 12 (41. 4 %), respectively. For the 572 critical values within the AMR for each test category, the mean absolute difference (mmol/L) and difference(%) between the two <b>testing</b> <b>runs</b> were: potassium, 0. 1 mmol/L (2. 7 %); sodium, 2. 1 mmol/L (1. 7 %); calcium, 0. 05 mmol/L (3. 0 %); glucose, 0. 18 mmol/L (2. 6 %) ...|$|E
