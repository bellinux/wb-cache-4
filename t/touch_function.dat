40|$|DoctorRecently, the AMOLED {{displays}} {{that have}} the <b>touch</b> <b>function</b> is in the spotlight in the display industry along with the developing the smart devices. Because AMOLED display has many advantages such as excellent color characteristic, vivid image, wide viewing angle, fast response time, low power consumption, and the slim design possibility and the touch technology makes people communicate the machine easily. However, AMOLED displays generally have the image non-uniformity by the characteristics of TFT so that many methods have been proposed to resolve the problem. The representative methods are to develop the TFT backplane {{and to use the}} compensation pixel circuit. In this thesis, I used the ASPC TFT due to the excellent uniformity of TFT characteristics and proposed the voltage programmed pixel circuit to compensate for the threshold voltage and the mobility. I also used the capacitive touch sensing method because it is suitable for the small and middle size applications and it can detect the multiple touches. Especially, the embedded touch sensing structure facilitate panel cost decrease, panel thickness decrease, brightness increase, and the easily developing the sensing IC, among others. In this thesis, I studied the design of the embedded touch sensing active area for AMOLED displays that are highly regarded as required functions in smart devices. Therefore there are the pixel circuit and the touch sensing circuit in the active area so that I proposed the pixel circuit and the embedded touch sensing circuit. First, I proposed the pixel circuit that can compensate for not only the threshold voltage but also the mobility using the voltage programming method. The simulation results show that current variations of the proposed circuit are very small in comparison with those of the conventional circuit. The proposed circuit has a simpler pixel structure than the published compensation pixel circuits so that the production yield should be improved. Second, I also proposed the embedded capacitive touch sensing circuit to realize the <b>touch</b> <b>function.</b> I realize a variable capacitor by forming the self- and/ or mutual capacitance in the TFT circuit layer. In addition, I also proposed the compensation sensing circuit to improve the touch sensitivity. This circuit can not only compensate for the threshold voltage of driving TFT but also detect the touches. The simulation results show that the proposed circuits can detect the touches by using the integrator’s output and the variation of the integrator’s output of the proposed circuit is very small...|$|E

40|$|In 1979, Erving Goffman {{published}} Gender Advertisements, {{the seminal}} work in critiquing gender displays in advertising. Goffman noted seven major phenomena that demonstrated the cultural infantilization of women and their ritualized subordination in advertisements. This study, conducted in Goffman’s phenomenological tradition, investigates modern commercial advertisements to update Goffman’s work and determine {{the presence of a}} new phenomenon, the mechanization of women. Advertisements were collected and studied based on Goffman’s five coding categories: relative size, feminine <b>touch,</b> <b>function</b> ranking, ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdrawal. In addition, Facebook photographs were analyzed based on the same coding categories to find whether women portray themselves in personal yet publically available photographs {{in the same way as}} women are displayed by others in advertising images. The results indicate that modern advertisements portray women in much the same manner as in the 1979 advertisements from Goffman’s original study, and evidence can be found that supports a new advertising pattern of the mechanization of women. However, in Facebook photographs, women tend to display themselves with greater individuality than the way they are portrayed in commercial advertisements. These findings have greater implications on the future of gender displays in advertising and women’s self-portrayal, particularly in relation to the creation of a new feminist movement...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and aims: In {{planning}} {{rehabilitation services}} {{for patients with}} stroke, {{it is important to}} know the frequency of the impairments and activity limitations presented by the patients and also how each body function and activity is associated with other body functions and activities, as well as the patients health-related quality of life (HRQL) at different time-points after stroke. The overall aims of the thesis were to describe body functions, activities and HRQL in patients with stroke and to analyse the associations between those variables, in the first week and at three and 18 months after stroke onset. Patients and methods: This thesis is based on two samples of consecutively recruited patients, presented in four papers. The patients presented in Paper I, II and IV were assessed in the first week (N= 109) as well as at three (N= 95) and 18 months (N= 66) after stroke with reference to: occurrence of stereotyped mass patterns of movement (Brunnström s hemiplegic limb synergies); muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale); muscle stiffness (self-report); tendon reflexes (physical examination); motor performance (Lindmark Motor Assessment Scale); fine hand use (Nine Hole Peg Test); grip strength (Vigorimeter); somatosensory functions (light touch and Thumb Localizing Test); mobility (Rivermead Mobility Index); self-care, i. e. activities of daily living, ADL (Barthel Index); and HRQL (SF- 36). For Paper III, 115 patients, ≥ 65 years, were assessed five days after stroke with reference to: somatosensory, perceptual (Line- and Letter Cancellation Tasks and Kohs Block Design Test); and cognitive functions (Mini Mental State Examination); depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale); mobility; and self-care. Results: Three months after stroke, the voluntary movements of 13 % of hemiparetic stroke patients were restricted to the hemiplegic limb synergies, all of which displayed spasticity (Paper I). Eighteen months after stroke, 20 % of all patients and 34 % of the hemiparetic patients, displayed spasticity (Paper II). Both spasticity and the hemiplegic limb synergies were associated with impaired movements and activity limitations although severe disabilities were seen both in patients with and without these impairments (Papers I and II). Hemiparetic patients without spasticity had significantly better HRQL on one of the eight SF- 36 health scales, than patients with spasticity (Paper II). Multivariate analyses showed that normal proprioceptive function was significantly associated with better mobility, five days after stroke onset. Normal perceptual and touch functions were significantly associated with better self-care (Paper III). Seventy percent of all patients had limited fine hand use in the first week, 41 % at three months and 45 % at 18 months after stroke. The strength of the associations between fine hand use and <b>touch</b> <b>function,</b> upper extremity movement function and self-care, respectively, was moderate to high but decreased over time. In general, fewer patients improved from limited fine hand use compared to other disabilities (Paper IV). Conclusions: The assessment of hemiplegic limb synergies, as presented by Brunnström, may only be suitable for a small fraction of hemiparetic patients namely, those displaying spasticity. The current exaggerated focus on reflex-mediated spasticity in stroke care seems to overestimate its clinical importance, not for the single patient, but from a population-based perspective. It is of specific importance to consider somatosensory and perceptual functions, respectively, in the rehabilitation of older patients in the acute phase after stroke, since these functions significantly affect the patients mobility and self-care levels. Limited fine hand use is common after stroke. With time after onset, patients with stroke seem to become less dependent on fine hand use when performing upper extremity movements and self-care activities...|$|E

40|$|Like {{many other}} museums, the Enlightenment Gallery at The British Museum {{provides}} handling objects for visitors. As Enlightenment notions {{of science and}} rational thought have all been predicated upon a shift away multi-sensory experience towards objective vision, the introduction of these tactile objects could {{be read as a}} pre-modern anachronism. In contrast, this paper uses a close analysis of the Hans Sloane’s approach to collecting and John Locke’s empirical philosophy to ask whether it is possible to locate touch as part of the Enlightenment rational project. If so, then how do our conceptions of empiricism, museums and visitors change? I argue that for Sloane and Locke <b>touch</b> <b>functions</b> in rational terms, indeed it may be the basis of rational thought. At the same time, a careful reading of Locke and of Condillac’s work on Locke shows that touch simultaneously opens up other, imaginative, speculative and emotional ways of knowing material objects. Crucially, these forms of knowing are not in opposition to rationality but form part of the rational project. Thus, this analysis of touch disputes the accepted transition from multisensory, non-rational and pre-modern experience to visual, rational and modern knowledge, questions accepted characterisations of empiricism and also considers contemporary visitors’ complex understandings of museum objects...|$|R

We further demonstrate that DOR activation at the central terminals of myelinated mechanoreceptors depresses synaptic input to the spinal dorsal horn, via the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels.

40|$|The {{environment}} that plants grow in {{can be highly}} dynamic through a plant’s lifetime. In many cases, plants {{have to compete with}} other plants in their direct surroundings for a limited pool of resources. Competitive interactions among plants shape vegetation composition and control biodiversity, {{making it one of the}} most important processes for the development of local vegetation patterns. To compete successfully, plants exploit a range of phenotypic responses that enhance resource capture and thus increase their fitness during competition. These responses depend on detection of proximate neighbours and adequate responses to the environment. This thesis describes the earliest cues that are involved in the detection of neighbouring plants. Further, the effect of competition for light on the emission and functionality of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is investigated. In chapter 2, the touch of leaftips of neighbouring plants is introduced as a cue to detect these neighbours. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this <b>touch</b> <b>functions</b> as the earliest signal to detect neighbours. Duet o this touch, leafs are more vertically orientated (which is called hyponasty). This leads to an environment in which the red to farred ratio decrease, which is the next cue for plants to detect neighbours. In chapter 3, the interaction between the volatile plant hormone ethylene and a reduction in R:FR was further investigated. Here, it is described that perception of ethylene is required for low R:FR induced petiole elongation, when the R:FR ratio is mildly reduced. At a more severely reduced R:FR ratio, perception of ethylene enhances the rate of hyponastic leaf movement. Chapter 4 describes effects of neighbour-induced alterations in the light environment on VOC emissions in Arabidopsis. Light signals that represent different degrees of competition for light led to similar reductions in the emission of VOCs. The emission of methyl-jasmonate-induced VOCs, was found to be reduced in low R:FR conditions and this affected plant preference of the specialist herbivore Pieris brassicae. In the last experimental chapter, the effect of low R:FR conditions on volatile effects between plants is demonstrated in barley (Hordeum vulgare). When volatile-emitting plants were exposed to low R:FR, VOC emissions were reduced. As a consequence, effects on carbon allocation by VOCs from emitter plants of one cultivar (Alva) on receivers plant from another (Kara) depend highly on the R:FR conditions of the emitter. These data indicate the importance of the light environment on chemical interactions between plants...|$|R

Arguably, this mindset lacks an appropriate reading system able to interpret musculoskeletal disorders from a different perspective, where the properties of the nervous system are embraced into a more holistic and functional-related context.

Currently, to date, the application of theoretical knowledge acquired on the relatively recent neuroscientific concepts and evidence concerning of interoception, sensitization, <b>touch,</b> autonomic <b>functions,</b> inflammation, and pain into a clinical/research manual medicine scenario is lacking, even if theoretically, the impact on the possible etiological mechanisms and treatment effects seems to be important.

With this function, null models can be stratified by groups of species or sampling units, or it is possible to run models in pieces. The models can be expanded with new simulations, or null models can be simulated in parallel. several ordi* functions that add graphical items to ordination plots are now more flexible and easier to parametrize with colours, line types etc. This also concerns functions like plotting betadisper results. There is also a new function that can plot SD, SE or CI crosses instead of corresponding ellipses, and ordiellipse can draw ellipsoid hulls that enclose all points in each group. metaMDS strategies changed so that it is easier to avoid local optima and to see which stopping criterion should be changed to reach the solutions. The MDSrotate function can now rotate a multidimensional MDS solution to separate groups optimally in first dimensions. designdist knows now beta-diversity notation so that, e. g., Whittaker's index can be calculated as designdist(BCI, "gamma/alpha - 1 ", alphagamma = TRUE). permustats support functions were improved for analysing permutation test statistics from various vegan objects. Now several permutations can be combined with new c() function, and summary can be used to evaluate the P-values also for combined results. Adjusted R-squared can now be analysed for db-RDA and cca. Parallel to this 2. 4 - 0 release, we also released a new version 1. 0 - 1 of vegan 3 d with similar improvements and bug fixes...|$|R
