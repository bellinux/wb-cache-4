"Introduce you to Mr. March, our editor, Mr. Beaton," [...] Fulkerson said, {{rolling his}} head in the {{direction}} of the elder man; and then nodding it toward the younger, he said, [...] "Mr. Dryfoos, Mr. Beaton." [...] Beaton shook hands with March, and then with Mr. Dryfoos, and Fulkerson went on, gayly: [...] "We were just talking of you, Beaton--well, you know the old saying. Mr. March, as I told you, is our editor, and Mr. Dryfoos has charge of the publishing department--he's the counting-room incarnate, the source of power, the fountain of corruption, the element that prevents journalism being the high and holy thing that it would be if there were no money in it." [...] Mr. Dryfoos turned his large, mild eyes upon Beaton, and laughed with the uneasy concession which people make to a character when they do not quite approve of the character's language. [...] "What Mr. March and I are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> carry on this thing so that there won't be any money in it--or very little; and we're planning to give the public a better article for the price than it's ever had before. Now here's a dummy we've had made up for 'Every Other Week', and as we've decided to adopt it, we would naturally like your opinion of it, so's to know what opinion to have of you." [...] He reached forward and pushed toward Beaton a volume a little above the size of the ordinary duodecimo book; its ivory-white pebbled paper cover was prettily illustrated with a water-colored design irregularly washed over the greater part of its surface: quite across the page at top, and narrowing from right to left as it descended. In the triangular space left blank the title of the periodical and the publisher's imprint were tastefully lettered so as to be partly covered by the background of color.|$|E

5000|$|Davutoğlu {{has called}} for Turkey to become {{more than just a}} {{regional}} power within Europe and the Middle East and expressed a desire for Ankara to have a far more influential role in world politics. Davutoğlu is generally linked to the notion of Turkish neo-Ottomanism, which favours a commonwealth with its neighbours and old Ottoman connections. Although his foreign policies have been regarded as neo-Ottomanist by Western and especially U.S. media, Davutoğlu does not accept such a characterization. He stated in an interview with Turkish daily Sabah that [...] "as much as we don't use this conceptualization, {{the fact that it is}} being used against us is either because of misunderstanding or lack of goodwill." [...] He argued against the idea that Turkey is trying to establish a neo-Ottoman imperial order: [...] "I have said that Turkey as a nation-state is equal with any other nation-state of our region whether it is small in population or area. We don't have any hegemony on anyone. Rather what we are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the establishment of a permanent peace in our region. If by order they mean is Pax Ottomana, Pax in the meaning of order, we are trying to establish a order, it is not wrong to say such thing." [...] In 2013, Davutoğlu spoke of developing a closer union between former Ottoman lands, though stated that territorial claims would never rest on historical borders.|$|E
30|$|Another {{issue is}} {{regarding}} our input traces. We {{are using a}} single trace for each application which includes {{a limited number of}} user actions and is recorded by members of our research group. One may ask whether these traces are representative of the users of that application? We argue that the session reconstruction problem is similar to code testing, where people are trying to reach sufficient code coverage; each RIA consists of several different actions, but many of them trigger the same code. Here we are not trying to be representative because it is not meaningful in this case, what we are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have a trace that covers the code of the application appropriately.|$|E

So, any change in their spectacle prescription during this period is forbidden. As a result, not only changing in hormones can cause myopic shift in vision, but also overweight has its retributive role.
