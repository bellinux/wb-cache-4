Typically, the initial temperature of the mixture is 12-18 °C. The carbonated mixture is fed into the evaporator of the apparatus, then freezes on the inner surface of the cylindrical evaporator and is scraped off by the blades—mixers rotating at 60 to 200 rpm. In the internal volume of the crystallizer, a slight positive pressure (up to 3 bar) is maintained to improve the dissolution of gas into the liquid. In modern frozen {{carbonated beverage}} devices, there is a conventional refrigeration circuit with a capillary tube or <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> and, usually, an air condenser. Refrigerant is fed either directly into the cavity of a two-wall evaporator or into the spiral evaporator wound on the outer surface of the crystallizer. The evaporator wall is made of stainless steel grade SS316L, approved for contact with food according to requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration. The evaporator temperature is −32 to −20 °C.

The difference between externally and internally equalized valves is how the evaporator pressure affects {{the position of the}} needle.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an approach for identifying critical model parameters in dynamic air-conditioning systems using limited sensor information. The expansion valve {{model and the}} compressor model parameters {{play a crucial role}} in the system model's accuracy. In the past, these parameters have been estimated using a mass flow meter; however, this is an expensive devise and at times, impractical. In response to these constraints, a novel method to estimate the unknown parameters of the expansion valve model and the compressor model is developed. A gray box model obtained by augmenting the expansion valve model, the evaporator model, and the compressor model is used. Two numerical search algorithms, nonlinear least squares and Simplex search, are used to estimate the parameters of the expansion valve model and the compressor model. This parameter estimation is done by minimizing the error between the model output and the experimental systems output. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear least squares algorithm was more robust for this estimation problem than the Simplex search algorithm. In this thesis, two types of expansion valves, the Electronic Expansion Valve and the <b>Thermostatic</b> <b>Expansion</b> <b>Valve,</b> are considered. The Electronic Expansion Valve model is a static model due to its dynamics being much faster than the systems dynamics; the <b>Thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model, however, is a dynamic one. The parameter estimation algorithm developed is validated on two different experimental systems to confirm the practicality of its approach. Knowing the model parameters accurately can lead to a better model for control and fault detection applications.

An analysis on an existing air-cooled reciprocating chiller showed that the range of differential pressures across TXVs restricts the maximum heat rejection airflow required to increase the chiller COP, though the set point of condensing temperature is reduced to 22 °C from {{a high level of}} 45 °C.

40|$|In some {{refrigeration}} applications, difficulties {{arise in}} establishing stable evaporator operating conditions, especially when using a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve.</b> The unstable superheat signal, sometimes called hunting, of an evaporator was investigated {{by developing a}} mathematical model of a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> and a two-passage concentric-tube evaporator. The model was then used to study the dynamic response of the evaporator and valve in response {{to changes in the}} system operating conditions. The evaporator model was based on a two-passage concentric-tube heat exchanger configuration. Equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were used to simulate the flow and heat transfer, where differential equations for the length of the two-phase region and mean void fraction allowed the dynamic behavior of the evaporator to be investigated. The model also has the capability {{to examine the effects of}} refrigerant and heat flux maldistribution among the passages. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> model takes into account the pressure forces on the diaphragm as well as the pressure drop across the orifice when predicting the refrigerant mass flow rate. The geometrical parameters that were varied in this study included the orifice size, obstructing pin-tip angle, and diaphragm area. The model also includes the effects of the spring constant, bulb time constant, and offset temperature-as determined by the force applied by the obstructing pin when the valve is closed. Superheat response was investigated by imposing suction line pressure oscillations that varied over a range of frequencies. Large superheat fluctuations were found to exist in a given frequency band, where the period was found to be on the order of 50 to 100 seconds, and pressure oscillations in this range should be avoided in operation. Disturbances outside of this frequency band did not produce significant superheat responses. Factors influencing the magnitude of the superheat response depend on the frequency of the perturbations: at high frequencies the valve does not respond to superheatfluctuations (feedback), but is very sensitive to the slope of the flow rate versus superheat curve as detennined by valve geometry; on the other hand, at low frequencies the valve behavior is dominated by the superheat feedback, and the flow rate versus superheat curve is insignificant. The effect of the valve parameters was also investigated by imposing a step increase of the suction line pressure and simulating the response of?? the evaporator superheat over time. This approach allowed comparison of the steady-state and transient behavior of superheat with different valve designs. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center Project 7...|$|E
40|$|The {{instability}} in a refrigeration system, conventionally known as hunting, is the phenomena of the oscillation of certain system operational parameters {{such as the}} degree of refrigerant superheat (DS), refrigerant mass flow rate and evaporating pressure. Hunting has been noticed in not only the refrigeration systems controlled by <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (TEVs), but also those controlled by electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (EEVs), and hence attracted {{a lot of research}} interest. However, no previous studies on the impacts of both the operational parameters of an EEV and the simultaneous variation of compressor and supply fan speed in a variable speed (VS) direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) system may be identified. Â This paper reports on a modeling study on the operational stability of a VS DX A/C system. An existing detailed, physical based dynamic model for a VS DX A/C system has been further developed by adding equations for both the temperature sensor in an EEV and the air side of the evaporator. Using this further developed model, a modeling study on the stability of a VS DX A/C system based on the classical minimal-stable-signal (MSS) theory has been carried out. The effects of the dynamics of the temperature sensor, Proportional-Integral (PI) control settings of the EEV and variable speed operation of both compressor and supply fan on the operational stability of the VS DX A/C system have been investigated. The modelling results demonstrated that increasing the time constant of the temperature sensor would help mitigating the system instability, and increasing the compressor speed or decreasing the supply fan speed would lead to the movement of a mixture-vapor transition point towards evaporator exit, leading to potential instability of the VS DX A/C system. ...|$|R
40|$|Referring to a vapour {{compression}} plant able {{to operate}} both as water chiller and heat pump, {{the aim of this}} paper is to evaluate experimentally the energy saving obtainable varying the scroll compressor speed to control the refrigeration capacity instead of the classical thermostatic control. The compressor speed is continuously controlled by means of a fuzzy algorithm regulating an inverter located on the electric line supplying the compressor motor. On the contrary the control by thermostat imposes on/off cycles on the compressor that works at the nominal frequency of 50 Hz. In particular, the performances of a vapour compression experimental plant, generally used in industrial processing or conditioning plants where a supply of refrigerated and reheated water is required, are studied. The experimental plant is made up of an hermetic scroll compressor, a plate-type water heat exchanger inserted in a water tank, a finned tube air heat exchanger, two <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> that have substituted the classical capillaries not suitable for fast load variations.

40|$|<b>Thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (TEV) and {{electronic}} <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> (EEV) are <b>expansion</b> devices {{commonly used in}} air-conditioning system which involves the spray and atomization process of the refrigerant. Most previous studies focused on the macro-features of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> such as the refrigerant pressure drop through the valve, the response time of the valve to the change of superheat in the evaporator, or {{the relationship between the}} location of the valve and the system efficiency, etc. However, few studies have looked into the valve and fundamentally studied the physical process of the refrigerant taking place near the orifice, where the refrigerant goes through the major pressure drop. The atomization and spray process are crucial to the performance of the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> since the downstream refrigerant are mainly determined by these processes in terms of mass flow rate, quality and homogeneity. Non-homogenous flow can cause poor refrigerant distribution among the circuit inside the evaporator, and essentially decrease the efficiency of the entire air-conditioning system. The other issue involved with the TEV and EEV is the mass flow control, which is namely called as ???valve hunting???. One of the greatest advantages such <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> can provide compared with traditional <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> is their capability to control the refrigerant mass flow rate according to the superheat degree of the evaporator, so that the system can always run in the most efficient mode and achieve the desired cooling capacity at the same time. Yet TEV or EEV can either starve or over feed the evaporator, due to the response time to the change of superheat degree, and inaccurate control of the valve opening and closing. Either starving or over feeding the evaporator can hurt the system performance: the former can decrease the cooling capacity while the later can result in liquid refrigerant going into the compressor, and cause damage to the compressor, in the worst scenario. Although the ???valve hunting??? has been addressed for a long time, few papers have tried to explain and solve this problem regarding to the refrigerant spray and atomization process. In this study, such techniques were applied {{to the study of the}} TEV and EEV. The expansion process was studied by introducing a valve with optical access. The break-up and atomization of the refrigerant were visualized near the outlet of the orifice under different feeding conditions on micro-second scale applying backlit illumination technology. A new image processing method is proposed for cone angle and film thickness determination. A Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) system was used later to measure the size and velocity of individual droplets passing the location at the outlet of the orifice. It is found that the increase of the feeding pressure tends to expand the spray cone angle while its impact on the film thickness is not quite obvious. The expansion of the cone angle resulted in more drops splashed from the edge of the needle base and the presence of the drops becomes more random. To further evaluate the impact of the feeding pressure, the drops size distribution under different pressure difference along the radial directions is measured. The drops size dependency on radial distance and pressure difference are acquired based on curve fit of the results...|$|R

Improper refrigerant charge can increase energy usage, reduce capacity, and decrease equipment lifespan. Furthermore, refrigerant charge leakage can contribute to global warming in the long term. ^ The primary goal of the thesis is to evaluate and enhance the virtual refrigerant charge sensor, developed by Li and Braun (2006 a). The virtual refrigerant charge sensor algorithm employs low-cost and non-invasive measurements (i. e. surface mounted temperature measurements) to estimate refrigerant charge level for packaged air conditioning systems. It can be embedded within a portable device (i. e. a PDA) for a technician 2 ̆ 7 s use in the field or permanently installed on units. ^ To evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} virtual refrigerant charge sensor, data collected from previous laboratory tests and a manufacturer were utilized. In addition, new laboratory tests and simulations were performed to obtain data for various system types over a wider range of operating conditions. The systems for the new laboratory tests included residential split systems that employ fixed capillary tubes, or <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> and R- 22 or R- 410 a as the refrigerant. ^ To assess the impact of refrigerant charge level on system performance, capacity, efficiency, and operating cost were calculated from the data for the units tested in the laboratory at all test conditions and for some of the data obtained from the manufacturer. Based on the evaluations, the virtual charge sensor was found work well in estimating the refrigerant charge for systems that do not utilize accumulators when using the original default parameters. For systems with accumulators, however, the parameters needed to be improved. ^ A new method for determining default parameters was developed that depends on three elements: liquid line length, rated subcooling, and rated charge. The liquid line length is particularly important because a substantial amount of refrigerant is stored as liquid. The parameters decreased the errors between the actual and predicted charge. Even better performance was achieved for the virtual refrigerant charge sensor when the improved parameters were tuned, minimizing the errors by using test data and linear regression. Overall, the enhanced method provided estimates of refrigerant charge that were within 10...|$|R

Coefficient of Performance (COP) with the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is between 3. 4 – 7. 53, while the capillary is between 2. 8 – 3. 6...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{paper has}} {{designed}} the controlling circuit of CO 2 heat pump water based on C 8051 F 500 SCM and electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve.</b> The controlling circuit {{is composed of}} a temperature detection circuit and a electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> drive As the temperature detection circuit uses a constant current source design, {{it would not be}} influenced by ambient temperature and can work in different temperature environment. This detection circuit’s temperature range is- 50 ℃-+ 135 ℃. Electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> drive circuit has added a photoelectric coupling isolation circuit to enhance its anti-interference capability. The system can adjust the size of the opening of electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> according to water temperature. The opening adjustment can reach 480 steps; and the adjust speed is 2 steps per second...|$|R
40|$|A {{traditional}} {{method of}} controlling evaporator superheat in a vapor compression {{air conditioning system}} is the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> (TXV). Such systems are often used in automotive applications. The TXV depends on superheat to adjust the valve opening. Unfortunately, any amount of superheat causes that evaporator to operate at reduced capacity due to dramatically lower heat transfer coefficients in the superheated region. In addition, oil circulation back to the compressor is impeded. The cold lubricant almost devoid of dissolved refrigerant is quite viscous and clings to the evaporator walls. A system that could control an air conditioner to operate with no superheat would either decrease {{the size of its}} existing evaporator while maintaining the same capacity, or potentially increase its capacity with its original evaporator. Also, oil circulation back to the compressor would be improved. To operate at this twophase evaporator exit condition a feedback sensor would have to quantify the quality of liquid mass fraction (when the exit stream is a mixture of droplets and superheated vapor) of the refrigerant exiting the evaporator.

40|$|Several {{laboratory}} experiments {{have studied the}} effect of faults on vapor compression cycle air-conditioning systems. There has been a particular focus on refrigerant charge variation, which {{is believed to be}} quite common in air conditioners, and a lesser focus on heat exchanger fouling. The majority of the published results evaluate the fault effects on particular system operating parameters in one unit. For example, the effect on capacity and efficiency are typically evaluated. The results differ from one study to the next. The current paper summarizes the effects for all of the results available in the literature for condenser fouling and refrigerant charge variation, and provides generalized relationships. The generalizations are provided for ANSI/AHRI 210 / 240 standard test conditions and are provided separately for fixed orifice and <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> equipped systems. The level of variation found in the summary shows that for many applications, it is reasonable to the use generalized relationships to estimate the effect of faults on systems that have not been tested in a laboratory...|$|E
40|$|The Kigali {{amendment}} to the Montreal Protocol has highlighted the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) phase out as a priority to reduce the future global mean temperature increase. R 134 a is the most abundant HFC in the atmosphere and therefore it must be substituted using environmentally benign alternatives. In the short term, blends of HFCs and hydrofluoroolefins can replace R 134 a. This paper experimentally evaluates R 450 A (GWP of 547), a non-flammable mixture of R 1234 ze(E) and R 134 a, in an R 134 a small capacity refrigeration system. The controlled experimental conditions cover evaporating temperatures from − 15 to 12. 5 [*]°C and condensing temperature of 25, 30 and 35 [*]°C (36 tests in total for each refrigerant). The experimental results showed that with only a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> adjustment the average R 450 A cooling capacity and COP are 9. 9 % and 2. 9 % lower than those measured using R 134 a. Besides, the observed compressor discharge temperature values of R 450 A are not {{greater than that of}} R 134 a...|$|E
