5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable <b>to</b> <b>quantize</b> the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E

25|$|Common {{criticisms of}} the Copenhagen {{interpretation}} often lead {{to the problem of}} continuum of random occurrences: whether in time (as subsequent measurements, which under certain interpretations of the measurement problem may happen continuously) or even in space. A recent experiment showed that a particle may leave a trace about the path which it used when travelling as a wave ndash& and that this trace exhibits equality of both paths. If such result is raised to the rank of a wave-only non-transactional worldview and proved better ndash& i.e. that a particle is in fact a continuum of points capable of acting independently but under a common wavefunction ndash& it would rather support theories such as Bohm's one (with its guiding towards the centre of orbital and spreading of physical properties over it) than interpretations which presuppose full randomness, because with the latter it will be problematic to demonstrate universally and in all practical cases how can a particle remain coherent in time, in spite of non-zero probabilities of its individual points going into regions distant from the centre of mass (through a continuum of different random determinations). An alternative possibility would be to assume that there is a finite number of instants/points within a given time or area, but theories which try <b>to</b> <b>quantize</b> the space or time itself seem to be fatally incompatible with the special relativity.|$|E

Pauli made the prescient comment that the theory would be extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>quantize,</b> and Einstein said that one might try to apply this method to gravity in general relativity, which Sir Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar did much later as the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity. Feynman received a PhD from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler.

500|$|The {{requirement}} of Lorentz invariance takes on perhaps its most dramatic effect in string theory. Classical relativistic strings {{can be handled}} in the Lagrangian framework by using the Nambu–Goto action. This results in a relativistically invariant theory in any spacetime dimension. But as it turns out, the theory of open and closed bosonic strings (the simplest string theory) is impossible <b>to</b> <b>quantize</b> {{in such a way}} that the Lorentz group is represented on the space of states (a Hilbert space) unless the dimension of spacetime is 26. The corresponding result for superstring theory is again deduced demanding Lorentz invariance, but now with supersymmetry. In these theories the Poincaré algebra is replaced by a supersymmetry algebra which is a -graded Lie algebra extending the Poincaré algebra. The structure of such an algebra is to a large degree fixed by the demands of Lorentz invariance. In particular, the fermionic operators (grade [...] ) belong to a [...] or [...] representation space of the (ordinary) Lorentz Lie algebra.
