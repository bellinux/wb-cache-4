500|$|The first European land {{exploration}} of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, passed this way {{on its way}} north, camping at San Juan Creek on July 23, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary: [...] "...we came to a very pleasant green valley, full of willows, alders, live oaks, and other trees not known to us. It has a large arroyo, which at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> crossed it carried a good stream of fresh and good water, which, after running a little way, formed in pools in some large patches of tules." [...] On the return journey to San Diego, the party used the campsite again, on January 20.|$|E

[...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E

500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium. [...] Amidst questions about the timing, Daniels argued that he didn't need to wait because [...] "it doesn't matter what the General Assembly does. This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were standing erect".|$|E

Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

500|$|Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{also had}} a {{positive}} review of the episode, writing that [...] "Confidence Man" [...] was [...] "A taut, tense, character-based episode which excelled on the Island and paid off in the flashback as well." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a 82/100, praising Sawyer's performance, and writing {{that it was a}} [...] "a very well written story", but criticized the music montage at the end as being a crutch, explaining that [...] "It’s as if the directors can’t think of any other way to finish the show." [...] Myles McNutt of The A.V.

500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you {{to come out and}} play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|The {{creative}} {{struggle was}} {{evident from the}} outset. Hoppus loved everything regarding Enema of the State — including the music videos and live show — and [...] "wanted to do it again," [...] desiring to create a bigger, better and louder follow-up. DeLonge, however, was striving for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock, which was inspired by post-hardcore bands Fugazi and Refused. Barker, [...] "never simply a punk rock drummer," [...] wanted to challenge himself and was listening to {{a great deal of}} hip hop and heavy metal. The lyrics often turned darker and more introspective for Hoppus, and [...] "love songs became broken love songs." [...] DeLonge rewrote some of his lyrics after listening to songs by Alkaline Trio, feeling as though he needed to [...] "step up his game." [...] DeLonge pushed his guitar style further away from that on Enema of the State: [...] "Arpeggiated guitar hooks became frenetic 1/16th note spasms," [...] wrote Hoppus in 2013. Barker's drum parts were looped and filtered, creating different sounds. For the first time, the trio worked in opposition to one another, and the sessions sometimes became contentious. Hoppus felt that the sessions created an unspoken competition between him and DeLonge, between who could write the better chorus or most clever lyrics. [...] "Our confidence and insecurity begat some heated differences, sometime to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had to leave rooms and cool down," [...] recalled Hoppus. Finn would often smooth over differences with a joke, offering a fresh perspective and advice.|$|E
