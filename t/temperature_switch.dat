50|$|Micro {{switches}} {{are very}} widely used; among their applications are appliances, machinery, industrial controls, vehicles, convertible tops {{and many other}} places for control of electrical circuits. They are usually rated to carry current in control circuits only, although some switches can be directly used to control small motors, solenoids, lamps, or other devices. Special low-force versions can sense coins in vending machines, or with a vane attached, air flow. Micro switches may be directly operated by a mechanism, or may be packaged {{as part of a}} pressure, flow, or <b>temperature</b> <b>switch,</b> operated by a sensing mechanism such as a Bourdon tube. In these latter applications, the repeatability of the actuator position when switching happens is essential for long-term accuracy. A motor driven cam (usually relatively slow-speed) and one or more micro switches form a timer mechanism. The snap-switch mechanism can be enclosed in a metal housing including actuating levers, plungers or rollers, forming a limit switch useful for control of machine tools or electrically-driven machinery.|$|E

However, the limitations of current diagnostic methods contribute {{to a lack of}} proper diagnosis in 62 % of patients.

Methods: A multiplex PCR Mag-Array (MPMA) system was developed that integrates three strategies: chimeric primer design, <b>temperature</b> <b>switch</b> PCR, and MagPlex-TAG techniques. The MPMA was used to amplify 13 target viral sequences simultaneously, with plasmids containing specific viral sequences as standard samples.

Experimental results show that Pluronic P 103 micelles allow extraction of phenol from aqueous solutions at 30 °C. The phenol can be released due to the transition of the Pluronic micelles into unimers with a mild <b>temperature</b> <b>switch</b> from 30 to 8 °C. Ultrafiltration membranes provide a barrier between the aqueous Pluronic stripping solution and the aqueous solution in a (bio) reactor containing the desired product. Additionally, a similar UF membrane is used to separate the micelles and unimers from water. Steady state model analysis of the proposed separation and regeneration process are performed to obtain a phenol mass flow rate in the product stream equal to the phenol production rate in the (bio) reactor. Furthermore, the process is analyzed for different process configurations and a cost estimation is made. The results show that for the model product phenol, the process costs are mainly determined by the required membrane area. The proposed process can be suited for products that allow for a higher critical concentration in the (bio) reactor as compared to phenol. The resulting higher driving force for membrane extraction will result in a decrease of the overall process costs. For products with a lower solubility in water, recovery is easy after regeneration of the micellar solvent. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
