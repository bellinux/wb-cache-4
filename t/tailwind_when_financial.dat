25|$|Bardwell Mill {{was built}} in 1823. It worked by wind until 1925 and then by a Blackstone oil engine until 1941. The mill was {{derelict}} in 1978 but was later purchased by James Waterfield, who completed {{the restoration of the}} mill in 1985. The mill was sold to Geoffrey and Enid Wheeler in July 1987. On 16 October 1987, the mill was <b>tailwinded</b> <b>when</b> one of the gears in the fantail drive system became disengaged. The result was that the windshaft sheared {{at the rear of the}} canister, bringing the sails crashing to the ground. Restoration work began again in 1989 but was hampered by limited funds. Geoffrey Wheeler died in 1995 and in 1997 The Friends of Bardwell Windmill was set up. English Heritage and St Edmundsbury Borough Council gave over £73,000 towards the estimated cost of £92,000 to restore the mill. The balance was to be raised by the Friends. A replacement cap, cast iron windshaft and fantail were fitted to the mill in 2004.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect that}} different designs in the access to fnancial transmission rights has on spot electricity auctions. In particular, I characterize the equilibrium in the spot electricity market <b>when</b> <b>financial</b> transmission rights are assigned to the grid operator and <b>when</b> <b>financial</b> transmission rights are assigned to the firm that submits the lowest bid in the spot electricity auction. <b>When</b> <b>financial</b> transmission rights are assigned to the grid operator, my model, {{in contrast with the}} models available in the literature, works out the equilibrium for any transmission capacity. Moreover, I have found that an increase in transmission capacity not only increases competition between markets but also within a single market. <b>When</b> <b>financial</b> transmission rights are assigned to the firm that submits the lowest bid in the spot electricity auction, firms compete not only for electricity demand, but also for transmission rights and the arbitrage profits derived from its hold. I have found that introduce competition for transmission rights reduces competition in spot electricity auctions. ...|$|R
