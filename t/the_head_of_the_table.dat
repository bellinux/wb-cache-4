500|$|As {{part of his}} {{association}} with BBC NOW, Puw was commissioned by the BBC to compose for the 2007 Proms. [...] His orchestral piece, [...] ("...unless I open the door...") was premiered on 9 August 2007, conducted by David Atherton. It {{is based on a}} story from the Mabinogion, a collection of medieval Welsh tales, in which a group of warriors, lately returned from Ireland, feast in Harlech for seven years with the severed head of their leader at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> [...] They then feast in Penfro for eighty years in a hall with three doors, and only remember the dreadful events that happened in Ireland when the third door opens. [...] Each of the three doors in Penfro was represented by an instrument in a box in the Royal Albert Hall.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{shows an}} aproned matriarch presenting a roasted turkey {{to a family}} of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation of family values. The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval from <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> which is the central element of the painting. Its creased tablecloth shows {{that this is a}} special occasion for [...] "sharing what we have with those we love", according to Lennie Bennett. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be cranberry sauce. There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered casserole dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.|$|E
500|$|The Duchess of Devonshire died in March 1806; and Cavendish's life at home became unhappy. Her {{father had}} been {{involved}} in a relationship with Lady Elizabeth Foster for years. Always greatly resentful of Foster's presence in the household, Cavendish was angered when she took control of their home, for instance disliking it when her place at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was taken by Foster. As the unmarried adult daughter, this role should have been taken by Cavendish, not by Foster (who was not yet married to her father). During this period, Cavendish frequently went to live with her elder sister, Georgiana, who was recently married to the future 6th Earl of Carlisle; Cavendish's son Frederick later wrote that the experience [...] "strengthened the tie of sisterly affection, which bound them together during the whole of their joint lives". From 1801 onwards, Cavendish wrote to her sister almost daily until the latter's death in 1858. Three years after her mother's 1806 death, the Duke married Foster.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{performed}} about 80 shots per exhibition. He {{had a large}} {{repertoire of}} practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as [...] "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, [...] "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at {{the short end of}} the table, three feet apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.|$|E

Its chairman was Glenn Barr, a high-ranking member of Ulster Vanguard and the UDA. In its first meeting, Barr arrived late and found Paisley sitting at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Barr told him [...] "you might be chairman of the Democratic Unionist Party but I'm chairman of the co-ordinating committee, so move over".

2500|$|Traditionally, {{everyone}} would {{use their own}} chopsticks to take food from the dishes to their own bowl, or to pass food from the dishes to the elders' or guests' bowls. Today usually only in restaurants or gatherings with non-family guests present, serving chopsticks (公筷, [...] "community-use chopsticks") are used. These are used to take food directly from serving dishes; they are returned to the dishes after one has served oneself. Due to better education regarding sanitary eating practices, many families are adopting this practice at private meals as well. Alternately, they can be left stationary on the table, especially {{in front of the}} host at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> so that the host can politely serve his honored guests on his left and right (and so they can serve him in return) without using their eating chopsticks.|$|E
