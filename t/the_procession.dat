5|$|The {{narrative}} of the frieze begins at the southwest corner where <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> appears to divide into two separate files. The first third of the west frieze {{is not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>procession,</b> but instead, seems to be the preparatory stages for the participants. The first figure here is a marshal dressing, W30, followed by several men preparing the horses W28–23 until figure W22 who, it has been suggested, may be engaged in the dokimasia, the tryout or enrollment of the knights. W24 is an ambiguous figure who might be either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a keryx (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost salpinx (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> proper.|$|E
5|$|The painting, set in {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of May 3, 1791, shows <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> of deputies from the Royal Castle (background), where the Constitution has just been adopted by the Great Sejm, to St. John's Collegiate Church (left, now an archcathedral), where a Te Deum will be sung. <b>The</b> <b>procession</b> moves down St. John's Street (ulica Świętojańska), surrounded by enthusiastic Warsaw residents and visitors. The deputies are protected by soldiers.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>processions</b> {{continue}} from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday morning. The {{climax of}} the week is the night of Holy Thursday, when <b>the</b> <b>processions</b> set out {{to arrive at the}} Cathedral on the dawn of Good Friday, known as the madrugá.|$|R
50|$|On {{three sides}} of the city hall's tower, traffic lights are {{permanently}} mounted especially for {{the orientation of the}} marksmen during <b>the</b> <b>processions.</b> At <b>the</b> beginning of <b>the</b> <b>processions,</b> <b>the</b> lights are turned from red to green so that marksmen on trooping grounds further off into the city know when to start marching.|$|R

5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
5|$|Ponticelli was {{the oldest}} living man of Italian birth and the oldest man living in France {{at the time of}} his death. Every Armistice Day until 2007 he {{attended}} ceremonies honoring deceased veterans. In his later years, he criticized war, and stored his awards from the First World War in a shoe box. While he felt unworthy of the state funeral the French government offered him, he eventually accepted one. However, he asked that <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> emphasise the common soldiers who died on the battlefield. French president Nicolas Sarkozy honored his wish and dedicated a plaque to them at <b>the</b> <b>procession.</b>|$|E
50|$|During Holy Week, {{the city}} is crowded with {{residents}} and visitors, drawn by the spectacle and atmosphere. The impact is particularly strong for the Catholic community. <b>The</b> <b>processions</b> are organised by hermandades and cofradías, religious brotherhoods. During <b>the</b> <b>processions,</b> members precede <b>the</b> pasos, dressed in penitential robes. They may also be accompanied by brass bands.|$|R

5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, a privilege only available to boys but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest at the times during which the priest reads from the Bible during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> in which the priest enters the church. Also present in <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she also leads <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting the candles in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E

5|$|Devotees {{visit the}} temple {{to attend the}} daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected outside {{for the sale of}} food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. On the {{penultimate}} day of the festival there is a procession, when the image of the goddess is placed upon a huge wooden chariot and pulled around the temple by devotees. On {{the final day of the}} festival, two large chariots are drawn by the devotees to the Deduru oya, a local river for the thirtham ("holy bath") ceremony when the images are dipped into the river. At the same time thousands of devotees also jump into the river. After the holy bath, <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> goes back to the temple along a route through Chilaw, accompanied by traditional Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians. <b>The</b> <b>procession</b> then passes the Ayyanayake and Kali temples prior to entering the main temple.|$|E

5|$|It {{was around}} this time that Edinburgh Zoo's now famous Penguin Parade was established.

5|$|Onlookers had {{gathered}} to watch <b>the</b> <b>procession,</b> {{and the soldiers}} were attacked on Eutaw Street by crowds throwing bricks and stones. No serious damage was done, and they continued until again, on Eutaw near Camden Street, they were stopped by the crowd, who injured several with their missiles.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{reveals that}} <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> was {{connected}} to the marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen’s six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen’s Horse in 1601.|$|E

5|$|The inauguration {{ceremony}} {{was conducted by}} the civic authorities and by the surviving, and still powerful, Guild of StGeorge, and combined elements of a public festival and a religious carnival. Four whifflers (city officials carrying swords) marched ahead of <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> to clear a path. Behind the whifflers, the incoming and outgoing mayors rode side-by-side, preceded by trumpeters and standard-bearers carrying the banners of England and St George, and followed by the city's Sheriffs and Aldermen in ceremonial gowns of violet and red, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>procession</b> was flanked by the city's waits (musicians playing loud wind instruments, usually the shawm) (a mediaeval double reed wind instrument with conical wooden body), and accompanied by dick fools (clowns carrying wands and wearing red and yellow gowns adorned with bells and cats' tails) and a man costumed as a dragon.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} festival to Athena in Athens was the Lesser Panathenaea, held annually, which {{was open to}} both sexes. Men and women were apparently not segregated during <b>the</b> <b>procession</b> leading the animals sacrificed to the altar, the festival's most religiously-significant part. Metics, both men and women, also had role in the Panathenaic procession, though it was subordinate {{to the role of}} the Athenians. In <b>the</b> <b>procession,</b> young noble girls (kanephoroi) carried sacred baskets. The girls were required to be virgins; to prevent a candidate from being selected was, according to Pomeroy, to question her good name. The sister of Harmodius was reportedly rejected as a kanephoros by the sons of Peisistratos, precipitating his assassination of Hipparchus.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. <b>The</b> <b>procession</b> of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E
