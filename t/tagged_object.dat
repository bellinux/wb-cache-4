40|$|Abstract:- RFID is the {{technology}} that identifies <b>tagged</b> <b>objects</b> without line of sight. <b>Tagged</b> <b>objects</b> are identified by the readers that are managed by the RFID middleware. Therefore, the performance of identification process for <b>tagged</b> <b>objects</b> can be improved how to manage the readers. In this paper, we propose the middleware framework with an algorithm to manage multi-readers based on this middleware to identify tags efficiently. The proposed middleware assigns the role of readers based on three parameters, i. e., application requirements, the feedback information of readers, and the information of connected readers. To determine the role of readers, the proposed middleware uses the PEG (Pre-Estimation of Group) algorithm. We examine the performance of proposed middleware framework and PEG algorithm by using Gen 2 simulator. As a result, when worst case is occurred in a particular group, the performance of tag identification per reader improves about 170 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} in indoor localization, because numerous applications depend on the rapid and accurate position estimation of <b>tagged</b> <b>objects.</b> While RFID-based indoor localization is attractive, {{the need for a}} large-scale and high-density deployment of readers and reference tags is costly.

Using a <b>tagged</b> <b>object</b> should not lead to existence of the tracing possibility. This concern is a challenging issue that has motivated the researchers to propose several authentication protocols to fix the traceability problem in RFID systems and also provide other security requirements. In this paper, we analyze the security of three authentication protocols which have recently been proposed by Morshed et al. [8]. Our security analysis clearly highlights important security pitfalls in these protocols which leads to their vulnerability against traceability. The complexity of the proposed attacks are only several runs of the protocols while the adversary’s advantages to trace the <b>tagged</b> <b>object</b> are maximal...|$|E

Although RFID has many benefits over other identification technologies, there are certain situations {{that can lead to}} uncertainty about the true location of the <b>tagged</b> <b>object.</b> In this paper we incorporate the knowledge about the operation of an RFID system and its various failure modes, and evidence from the RFID reader such as low-level diagnostic information in a single probabilistic model. The probabilistic model allows us to quantify and reduce the uncertainty associated with RFID operation, since we can provide the application with a single probability value that expresses the belief that a certain <b>tagged</b> <b>object</b> is present. The probabilistic framework is demonstrated {{with the help of a}} smart medicine cabinet. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems have become common in places where access control and tracking of physical objects is required.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method for}} the recognition of objects in an unconstrained environment with a widely ranging illumination, imaged from unknown view points and complicated background. The general problem is simplified by placing specially designed patterns on the object {{that allows us to}} solve the pose determination problem easily. There are several key components involved in the proposed recognition approach. They include pattern detection, pose estimation, model acquisition and matching, searching and indexing the model database. Other crucial issues pertaining to the individual components of the recognition system such as the choice of the pattern, the reliability and accuracy of the pattern detector, pose estimator and matching and the speed of the overall system are addressed. After establishing the methodological framework, experiments are carried out {{on a wide range of}} both synthetic and real data to illustrate the validity and usefulness of the proposed methods. The principal contribution of this research is a methodology for <b>Tagged</b> <b>Object</b> Recognition (TOR) in unconstrained conditions. A robust pattern (calibration chart) detector is developed for off-the-shelf use. To empirically assess the effectiveness of the pattern detector and the pose estimator under various scenarios, simulated data generated using a graphics rendering process is used. This simulated data provides ground truth which is difficult to obtain in projected images. Using the ground truth, the detection error, which is usually ignored, can be analysed. For model matching, the Chamfer matching algorithm is modified to get a more reliable matching score. The technique facilitates reliable <b>Tagged</b> <b>Object</b> Recognition (TOR). Finally, the results of extensive quantitative and qualitative tests are presented that show the plausibility of practical use of <b>Tagged</b> <b>Object</b> Recognition (TOR). The features characterising the enabling technology developed are the ability to a) recognise an object which is tagged with the calibration chart, b) establish camera position with respect to a landmark and c) test any camera calibration and 3 D pose estimation routines, thus facilitating future research and applications in mobile robots navigations, 3 D reconstruction and stereo vision...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to provide}} a system for {{monitoring}} and managing objects using Radio Frequency (RF) transmitters and receivers, operating the objects using Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) via mobile phones, and authenticated access by fingerprinting analysis. An object represents an electronic device that can be programmed. This system is based on RF transmitters and receivers that are tagged to the electronic objects to be operated and have the capability of transmitting signals. A transmitter transmits the signal containing the object Identifier (ID) and the system receiver detects this transmitted ID, and stores its corresponding information in the database which is created specifically for information maintenance of the tagged objects. Mobile phones are used to operate the <b>tagged</b> <b>object</b> by {{sending a message to}} the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) connected to a GSM modem. Once the system receives the fingerprint verification data and the operation code of the electronic <b>tagged</b> <b>object</b> via GSM modem, it fetches the relevant information from the database and encapsulates this information into a message which is sent to the receiver of the tagged electronic object along with its operation code. We begin by proposing a protocol for the system and perform a simulation to check the feasibility of this project before applying it to a real world scenario. In this simulation we test the capability of the transmitter and receiver to communicate effectively...|$|E

30|$|Passive tags require {{nonvolatile}} {{memories that}} retain the values stored {{even when the}} device is not powered, which is typically less than 200 bytes (Ahson and Ilyas 2008). This means that any additional information about the <b>tagged</b> <b>object</b> (e.g. product name, maintenance history, warranty) must be stored in a separate database. There are also benefits to having data not directly stored on the tag. First, the more data the tag has, the more power it requires to send back, ultimately reducing the read range. Without the data being backed up in a database, all data would {{be lost in the}} event the tag is damaged, lost or destroyed. Having the data stored in the database allows for the programming of an additional tag with the same unique ID in order to link it with the data. Not storing the data in the tag is also desirable for security reasons. Bhaskar (2007) explains potential security concerns with RFID and the data store on the tags, including tag cloning, tag data corruption, data theft and illicit tracking and data mining. Fortunately, there are several security measures and techniques, e.g., encryptions, protocols, that are used to prevent security breaches. Finally, the database can hold substantially more data over the lifetime of the <b>tagged</b> <b>object</b> than on the tag itself. Moreover, if the tag were to be destroyed, the data stored on it could be lost if not stored elsewhere.|$|E
