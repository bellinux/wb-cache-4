5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>the</b> forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
50|$|Pawnship was {{a common}} form of {{collateral}} in West Africa, which involved the pledge of a person (or {{a member of the}} person's family) to service to a person providing credit.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands. Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees.

Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E

5|$|The Bill of Rights is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215).

5|$|The Constitution {{introduces}} {{separation of}} powers. According to Belarusian law, each office is separate but {{must work together}} to serve <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing {{the role of the}} prime minister. Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the USSR. A delay occurred due to debates among Supreme Soviet deputies, who were also trying to stave off the opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close the Supreme Soviet down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. The former chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Stanislau Shushkevich, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition Belarusian Popular Front criticized the final drafts {{due to the lack of}} balance between the two parties and for allowing Vyachaslau Kebich to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.|$|E

The Diet is also able to impeach Court judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct. The Constitution, however, does not specify the voting methods, the number of members of each house, and all other matters pertaining to the method of election of the each members, and are thus, allowed to be determined for by law.|$|E

Tillman remained for the most part in Washington, and did not campaign, but came to Columbia for the state Democratic convention in May to discredit rumors about his health, which was indeed poor. He got Wilson to persuade one of his rivals, Congressman Asbury F. Lever, to abandon the race, and considered how to do the same to Blease. These plans had not yet come to fruition when Tillman was stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage at the end of June, and died July 3, 1918 in Washington, D.C.

5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E

5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights.

The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
