5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v.

Owsley and his colleagues opined that <b>this</b> <b>law</b> was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these laws}} were relaxed over time, Emperor Wu renewed the state's {{persecution}} of merchants when in 119 BCE {{he made it}} illegal for registered merchants to purchase land. If they violated <b>this</b> <b>law,</b> their land and slaves would be confiscated by the state. The effectiveness of <b>this</b> <b>law</b> is questionable, since contemporary Han writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land. A merchant who owned property worth a thousand catties of gold—equivalent to ten million cash coins—was considered a great merchant. Such a fortune was one hundred {{times larger than the}} average income of a middle class landowner-cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash-coin income of a marquess who collected taxes from a thousand households. Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a hundred million cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government.|$|E

However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. <b>This</b> <b>law</b> also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon is {{the only}} nation with a {{national}} law protecting this species. <b>This</b> <b>law</b> prohibits killing the rockfowl, though it can be captured with a proper permit. International trading of the grey-necked rockfowl is governed under CITES Appendix I, meaning that legal trading of this species is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances. In 2006 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species. This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.|$|E

In such adaptive behavior, ground reaction forces play an important role.

Applying <b>this</b> control <b>law</b> to a simple robot system, we examine <b>this</b> <b>law's</b> e±ciency. In <b>this</b> experiment, the robot achieves a behavior adaptive to constant external force.

5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of <b>this</b> <b>law</b> (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).|$|E
