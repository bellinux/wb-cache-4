5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E

25|$|There was {{no further}} {{talk of the}} {{concentric}} advance of three armies on London.

Rupert, needing above all, adequate time {{for the development of}} the northern offensive, was not in favour of abandoning any of <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> Essex's advance. Brentford, on the other hand, thought it advisable to contract the lines of defence, and Charles, as usual undecided, agreed to Rupert's scheme and executed Brentford's. Reading, therefore, was dismantled early in May, and Abingdon given up shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, {{to see that the}} fetus is well-positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. <b>The</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not want people to know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic kinetic {{resolution}} (DKR) {{occurs when}} the starting material racemate is able to epimerize easily, resulting in an essentially racemic starting material mix at all points during the reaction. Then, the enantiomer with <b>the</b> lower <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> activation can form in, theoretically, up to 100% yield. This {{is in contrast to}} standard kinetic resolution, which necessarily has a maximum yield of 50%. For this reason, dynamic kinetic resolution has extremely practical applications to organic synthesis. The observed dynamics are based on the Curtin-Hammett principle. <b>The</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> reaction of either enantiomer is necessarily higher than <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> epimerization, resulting in a kinetic well containing the racemate. This is equivalent to writing, for kR>kS,A number of excellent reviews have been published, most recently in 2008, detailing the theory and practical applications of DKR.|$|R

25|$|The large main {{stage was}} {{elevated}} {{and set up}} at the end of each arena, with a long catwalk extending from its middle to the center. The midsection had a circular stage, while the pathway ended into a heart-shaped stage. In order to facilitate Madonna and her dancers to appear anytime onstage, there were openings throughout the length of the stage, as well as causeways for disappearing beneath the structure at the end of each song. At the end of the main stage there were three large video screens in front of which the band was present, along with Madonna's two background vocalists. Stufish, who had previously developed the structures for The MDNA Tour, were enlisted for the stage on Rebel Heart also. They developed the elaborate and the main inspiration behind the shape was a hybrid between a cross, an arrow and a heart. The perpendicular structures emanating from the middle of the runway allowed Madonna and her dancers to reach more audience. A number of barriers and encasings were supplied by Mojo Barriers to separate the stage from the audience and the front production areas. All the barriers were supplied in black aluminium, in line with Madonna’s wish for <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> be unobtrusive.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several costs {{associated}} with circular migration. One of these is brain drain, where a migrant who migrates because of skills or education creates a loss of human resources {{in the country of}} origin. These highly skilled workers are in demand in the more developed countries, where in some areas <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> immigration have been reduced to allow for both permanent and temporary migration. At the same time, barriers against unskilled workers have been strengthened. The ability to use skills also varies and can constitute a cost to the migrant and the economy, If the migrants had unskilled jobs while working abroad, they will have little experience that will {{contribute to the development of}} their home country upon return. Additionally, even if the worker learned new technical or industrial skills, they may not be able to use them if their country of origin does not have the infrastructure or institutional framework to support them. Circular migration also has a social impact on the families of migrant workers. If labor migrants have children, these minors may be temporarily abandoned while their parents are abroad working. This issue is problematic and some authorities have begun to formulate policies to monitor the situation.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{has offered}} {{virtually}} universal {{access to its}} universities and academic colleges since the wave of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s prompted the establishment of numerous tertiary institutions to absorb the additional demand. However, the Arab and ultra-orthodox minorities still attend university in insufficient numbers. The Sixth Higher Education Plan places emphasis on encouraging minority groups to enrol in higher education. Two years after the Mahar programme was implemented in late 2012 for the ultra-orthodox population, student enrolment had grown by 1 400. Twelve new programmes for ultra-orthodox students have since been established, three of them on university campuses. Meanwhile, the Pluralism and Equal Opportunity in Higher Education programme addresses <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> integration of the Arab minority in the higher education system. Its scope ranges from providing secondary-school guidance through preparation for academic studies to offering students comprehensive support {{in their first year}} of study, a stage normally characterized by a high drop-out rate. The programme renews the Ma’of fund supporting outstanding young Arab faculty members. Since the introduction of this programme in 1995, the Ma’of fund has opened tenure track opportunities for nearly 100 Arab lecturers, who act as role models for younger Arab students embarking on their own academic careers.|$|E

25|$|Civil {{rights activists}} {{tried to work}} through <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> {{register}} African-American voters and enable them to vote. In the summer of 1963, from July through August, activists of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) came to Plaquemines Parish to run a voter registration drive for African Americans. About 45 members, both black and white, came {{to work in the}} parish and organize local people for voter registration classes, peaceful marches, and drives to register. In a short time, 300 CORE activists and local people were arrested for peaceful protest, but CORE leaders negotiated with the local sheriff and mayor to permit some actions. After training and concerted action, a number of local African Americans did succeed in registering to vote, although many were still prevented, on largely specious grounds for failing to answer questions about the state constitution. The movement also worked to get Seymourville and another small community included within the city boundaries; the city was trying to exclude these majority-black communities from being incorporated in order to prevent black votes from being counted for election of the city commission. Voting rights work took place in other nearby parishes as well; in October an African-American man was the first of his race to register to vote in West Feliciana Parish since the early years following disenfranchisement.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{efforts were}} rarely {{organised}}, those that were, were organised through the traditional social networks of the Islands; {{the absence of}} political parties and the weakness of trade unions meant that political networks that facilitated resistance in other countries were lacking in the Channel Islands. Patriotic pride was bound up more in survival than in imagery of resistance. Some individuals who were later eligible for awards from the Soviet Union for their help towards Soviet prisoners were reluctant to participate in what they considered propaganda. Personal contacts between fugitive prisoners and the families that had helped them were in some cases maintained after the war despite the Cold War and <b>the</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> communication. Communists and conscientious objectors, groups regarded with disdain by many Islanders, were among those who identified with and sympathised with fugitive workers. Others sympathised on compassionate grounds; some offering help {{in the way they}} hoped members of their own family caught up in the war might be treated by others wherever they might be. Some saw helping fugitives as the only practical way of defying the Germans in the face of obstacles to more active forms of resistance. In other occupied countries, those who sheltered victims of Nazism were generally offering help to local deserters from forced service and Jews – mostly their friends, neighbours, family, or people from the same social milieu. With so few Jews in the community, and the forced labour situation being different, in the Channel Islands those who helped fugitives were generally harbouring strangers with whom they did not share a language.|$|E
