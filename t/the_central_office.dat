5|$|During the First Indochina War, Lê Duẩn was {{an active}} revolutionary leader in South Vietnam. He headed <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> of South Vietnam, a party organ, from 1951 until 1954. During the 1950s Lê Duẩn became {{increasingly}} aggressive towards South Vietnam and called for reunification through war. By the mid-to-late 1950s Lê Duẩn had become the second-most powerful policy-maker within the Party, eclipsing former party First Secretary Trường Chinh. By 1960, he was officially the second-most powerful party member, after party chairman Hồ. Throughout the 1960s Hồ's health declined and Lê Duẩn assumed more of his responsibilities. On 2 September 1969, Hồ died and Lê Duẩn became the most powerful figure in the North.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, the Superior Courts of Justice and the School of Arts vacated the {{building}} after {{moving into a}} new courthouse which had been built {{on the site of}} Auberge d'Auvergne. The building was to be converted into an examination hall, but in August of that year, it was assigned to the Posts and Telephones Department. After extensive renovations, the auberge opened as the General Post Office on 4 July 1973, taking over the role from Palazzo Parisio. The auberge remained the GPO until Posta Limited opened a new complex at Marsa in October 1997. The auberge was also used by the Water and Electricity Department, the Agricultural Department and <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> of Statistics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There was a sense that there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The SS Medical Corps were {{initially}} {{known as the}} Sanitätsstaffel (sanitary units). After 1931, the SS formed the headquarters office AmtV as <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> for SS medical units. An SS medical academy was established in Berlin in 1938 to train Waffen-SS physicians. SS medical personnel did not often provide actual medical care; their primary responsibility was medicalized genocide. At Auschwitz, about three-quarters of new arrivals, including almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit were killed within hours of arrival. In their role as Desinfektoren (disinfectors), SS doctors also made selections among existing prisoners as to their fitness to work, and supervised the killing of those deemed unfit. Inmates in deteriorating health were examined by SS doctors, who decided {{whether or not they}} would be able to recover in less than two weeks. Those too ill or injured to recover in that time frame were killed.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{video for}} the song was filmed in December 1967, for <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> of Information in London. The video was {{supposed}} to be about Britain, and was meant to be distributed in the US and Canada. The video features Barrett (shown with an acoustic guitar for the first time) and the group miming to the song in a more conventional stage setting, with psychedelic projections in the background. The original audio to the promo is lost, and most versions use the BBC recording from late 1967, consequently causing sync issues most evident as Barrett sings the opening verse. The original film was considered to be lost, until it was re-discovered in the Manchester Arts Lab in 1999. Barrett and Waters first watched the promo video during the second week of December 1967.|$|E

5|$|After a posting in Prague {{to assist}} in setting up an {{emigration}} office there, Eichmann was transferred to Berlin in October 1939 to command <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> for Jewish Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo. He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the Nisko Plan, Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In {{the last week of}} October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to fend for themselves in an open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed. Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp. The operation soon was called off, partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being. Meanwhile, as part of Hitler's long-range resettlement plans, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories, and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east, particularly into the General Government.|$|E
5|$|The post {{system was}} the {{cornerstone}} of Abir's commercial activity. Each post was run by one or two European agents to oversee local operations. The salary for an agent was 1,800 fr per year, sometimes increasing to 2,100 fr in the second year, and the standard contract period was three years. Agents also received 60 fr of trade goods each month with which to buy their food. Despite the low wages the 2% commission that each agent received on rubber production made {{up the majority of}} the agents' pay, for example the agent at Bongandanga received 16,800 fr in commission in 1903. As a result, there were many applicants for each post and agents were hired with the expectation that they would increase production by 0.5–3 tons per month. This was implemented by extending the post to include more villages or increasing the quotas expected from the villagers, often indirectly forcing women and children to harvest the rubber as well. If production fell below the quota agents made up the shortfall in lost profits to the company from their pay. Each post consisted of a residence for the agent, barracks for armed sentries and sheds for rubber drying and storage, all built using labour conscripted from the villagers. A typical post employed ten African workmen to sort and dry the rubber, seven servants for the agent and thirty canoemen for local river transport. These were paid around 36.5 fr per year in goods, commonly 5kg of salt, one blanket, five machetes and trade goods to the value of 6.35 fr. The post system was managed by the Director of Congo Operations at <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> in Basankusu. He was assisted in his job of keeping production up and expenses down by the only Free State employee in the concession, the commander of the police. The police commander was in charge of suppressing revolts and punishing villages which dropped below the quota. He had access to a large force of men and river steamers which was stationed at Basankusu and could redeploy quickly to the site of large scale rebellions. Effective police commanders would receive bonuses paid for by Abir.|$|E
