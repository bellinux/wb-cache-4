25|$|In 1839, Aimé Thomé de Gamond, a Frenchman, {{performed}} the first geological and hydrographical surveys on the Channel, between Calais and Dover. Thomé de Gamond explored several schemes and, in 1856, he presented {{a proposal to}} Napoleon III for a mined railway <b>tunnel</b> from <b>Cap</b> Gris-Nez to Eastwater Point with a port/airshaft on the Varne sandbank {{at a cost of}} 170million francs, or less than £7million.|$|R

He would propose in total seven designs. His proposal was finally accepted in 1867 by Napoleon III and Queen Victoria but the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 brought an end to the project.|$|R
5000|$|The museum {{underwent}} major building {{works in}} 2007. This entailed removing the Rennie flat V steam engine (now {{to be found}} at Chatham Historic Dockyard) to create a larger exhibition space, a cafe and improved toilet facilities. With {{the closure of the}} East London Line in December 2007 for extensive upgrading the museum hoped that the access shaft into the tunnel (originally built to be the grand entrance hall to the <b>tunnel)</b> could be <b>capped</b> with a concrete shelf at the bottom, above the level of the trains. This shelf was completed in early 2010, with the inauguration taking place in late January. The access shaft took in its first groups from the general public on 14 February 2010 (Valentine's Day) when it was opened as the 'Tunnel of Love' for short historical presentations detailing the history of the tunnel and of some interesting historical notes from the private life and diary of Brunel's son, Isambard.|$|R
25|$|The tracks from Glasgow {{enter at}} {{the east end of}} the wide {{concourse}} which is flanked to the north and south by high stone walls, each capped {{at the east}} end by a castellated turret. A glazed roof between these walls sheltered the concourse until recently, but it has been removed and small shelters introduced. The northernmost line stops as a bay platform and is not in use, and platform 1 serving eastbound trains opens directly to the top of Station Avenue which slopes down to Cathcart Street through stone archways marking the station entrance. The two tracks in use continue westwards through a <b>tunnel</b> which is <b>capped</b> by the parapet wall to Terrace Road, which leaves Cathcart Street further to the west and rises steeply towards the station before turning south over the tunnel entrance and continuing to {{rise to the level of}} the Well Park. Doorways in the parapet wall lead to staircases down to each platform, and to a steel ramp down to Platform 2 serving westbound trains. Originally, there was only one doorway, which led to a sloping passageway which in turn connected with the (now removed) station's internal steel lattice footbridge.|$|R
