40|$|Although nonprofit {{is often}} {{considered}} to be synonymous with tax-exempt, many nonprofit organizations earn revenues from unrelated <b>taxable</b> <b>activities,</b> and on average these <b>taxable</b> <b>activities</b> generate $ 1. 5 Â million in revenues. Policymakers have {{expressed concern that the}} pursuit of unrelated taxable revenues can distract a nonprofit from its primary charitable mission. Our results show that nonprofits earn taxable revenues when the <b>taxable</b> <b>activities</b> produce a relatively higher return, the nonprofit itself is experiencing lower profitability, and donor aversion is lower.

40|$|Abstract- Nonprofit {{organizations}} earn both tax–exempt and tax-able revenues. Nonprofits {{may have}} a natural aversion to engaging in ancillary activities and, as a result, taxable ventures need to pro-vide higher returns than alternative investments.

This paper uses tax return data to test the theory that complementarities encourage <b>taxable</b> <b>activities.</b> Complementarities can lower production costs and make it easier for a nonprofit to allocate joint costs from tax–exempt to <b>taxable</b> <b>activities.</b> I find support for both hypotheses...|$|R

5000|$|The U.S. {{income tax}} system imposes a tax based on income on individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts.

The definition of taxable income for federal purposes is used by many, but far from all states. Income and deductions are recognized under tax rules, and there are variations within the rules among the states. Book and tax income may differ. Income is divided into [...] "capital gains", which are taxed at a lower rate and only when the taxpayer chooses to [...] "realize" [...] them, and [...] "ordinary income", which is taxed at higher rates and on an annual basis.

Using a large cross-sectional sample of U. S. states over 1960 - 94, the empirical model tests the predictions of the theoretical model {{within the context of the}} state tax policy on gasoline.
