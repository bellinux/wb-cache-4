The rates of energy emission from the kink oscillating near the inhomogeneity {{and from a}} quiescent breather performing internal oscillations are calculated.

However, some systems maintaining sexuality appear particularly labile and raise intriguing questions on the evolutionary routes to asexuality. Thelytokous parthenogenesis is a form of spontaneous loss of sexuality leading <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> <b>distortion</b> of sex ratio towards females and resulting from mutation, hybridization or infection by bacterial endosymbionts. We investigated whether ecological specialization is a likely mechanism of spread of thelytoky within insect communities. Focusing on the highly specialized genus Megastigmus (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), we first performed a large literature survey to examine the distribution of thelytoky in these wasps across their respective obligate host plant families. Second, we tested for thelytoky caused by endosymbionts by screening in 15 arrhenotokous and 10 thelytokous species for Wolbachia, Cardinium, Arsenophonus and Rickettsia endosymbionts and by performing antibiotic treatments. Finally, we performed phylogenetic reconstructions using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to examine the evolution of endosymbiont-mediated thelytoky in Megastigmus and its possible connections to host plant specialization. We demonstrate that thelytoky evolved from ancestral arrhenotoky through the horizontal transmission and the fixation of the parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia. We find that ecological specialization in Wolbachia's hosts was probably a critical driving force for Wolbachia infection and spread of thelytoky, but also a constraint. Our work further reinforces the hypothesis that community structure of insects is a major driver of the epidemiology of endosymbionts and that competitive interactions among closely related species may facilitate their horizontal transmission...|$|E

Benchmarks using CCSD(T) against diatomic experimental results suggest satisfactory {{performance for the}} weighted core-valence basis sets (new basis sets for K, Rb, and Cs) selected for predicting reliable structures and harmonic vibrational frequencies. An isomer search using the B 3 LYP functional yields a planar, yet asymmetric T-shaped Cs structure as the global minimum for all MX 3 species. Much higher level CCSD(T) computations show a moderate <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> <b>distortion</b> of the X 3 ˉ anion by the M+ cation in the respective equilibrium geometries. Most obviously, for LiCl 3 the two Cl-Cl distances are separated by 0. 786 Å. Even for CsI 3, the structure least distorted from the M+X 3 ˉ model, the two I-I distances differ by 0. 243 Å. It does not take much energy to distort the parent anions along an asymmetric stretch, so this is no surprise. The normal modes of vibration of the MX 3 molecules are in better agreement with matrix isolation experiments than previous calculations. And these normal modes are revealing [...] instead of the well-established antisymmetric and symmetric stretches of the “free” X 3 ˉ anions, relatively localized and mutually-perturbed X-X and M-X stretches are calculated. The suggestion emerges that the MX 3 system may be alternatively described as an MX-X 2 complex, rather than the M+X 3 ˉ ion pair. This perspective is supported by bonding analyses showing low electron densities at the bond critical points and natural bond orders between the MX and X 2 moieties. The thermochemistry of fragmentations of MX 3 to MX + X 2 vs. M+ + X 3 ˉ also supports the alternative viewpoint of the bonding in this class of molecules...|$|E

Among these the most studied is certainly cis-diamminodichloroplatinum(II), or cisplatin, which after an activation process, attacks DNA in guanine-rich regions leading <b>to</b> <b>strong</b> <b>distortion</b> of DNA structure. Theoretical and experimental works suggest 7 t-stacking disruption and GC pair distortion {{as the most}} relevant effects. In this work, ab initio and DFT calculations are extensively employed in order to explore the role of basic forces in DNA and metal-DNA adducts. To do so, Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory {{has been used as}} a tool to decompose binding energies into contributions of covalent bond, H-bond and rc-stack energies, leading to a clearer picture of the studied systems. Firstly, DFT methods were employed to investigate the hydrolysis mechanism of cisplatin, a key step in the activation of the drug. Subsequently, an ADM based approach has been proposed to estimate H-bond energies in metal-DNA complexes. This allowed us to investigate the effect of platination on GC pair and, more generally, the role of H-bonding in such systems. A large study of transition metal- purine complexes, from Ti to Hg, has been discussed, providing a systematic analysis of the effect of metallation on the GC pair. As well as H-bonding, 7 c-stacking plays a fundamental role in DNA and metal-DNA structures. In order to avoid use of expensive and, in certain cases, prohibitive methods such as MP 2 and CCSD calculations, a new hybrid DFT functional, BHandH, has been applied to stacked model complexes (from benzene to DNA nucleobases). In addition, AIM analysis was shown to be useful tool in estimating it-stacking interactions in these systems. Thus, QM/MM calculations (QM = BHandH, MM = AMBER) were employed in order to investigate the role of H-bonding and -stacking in DNA and cisplatin-DNA adducts, the interplay between those being our main focus. One example of realistic platinated octamer was also studied with the BH&H/AMBER/AIM approach, leading to general agreement with experimental data...|$|E

40|$|Using an ab-initio {{molecular}} dynamics scheme (the Fireball scheme), we determined the equilibrium structure of intermediate size Si_nGe_m (n+m= 71) nanoclusters with/without hydrogen passivation on the surface. Due <b>to</b> the <b>strong</b> surface <b>distortion,</b> defect states {{are found to}} permeate the energy gap of Si_nGe_m clusters. However, the defect states are removed by adding H atoms {{on the surface of}} Si_nGe_m clusters, and the gap opens up to a few eV, indicating a blueshift for photoluminescence. It is also found that the radiative transition between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) states is enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude for Si_nGe_m nanoclusters with respect to the corresponding pure Si clusters. This significant increase of the emission probability is attributed <b>to</b> the <b>strong</b> overlap of HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions that are centered mostly on the Ge atoms.
