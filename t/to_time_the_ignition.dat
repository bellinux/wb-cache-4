In 1899 they established the jointly owned Compagnie des Magnetos Simms-Bosch but it foundered in 1906 on personal differences between the partners. In 1907 Simms established the Simms Magneto Company Ltd to manufacture magnetos under licence from Robert Bosch but he was unable to compete with European prices and it closed in 1913. He had however contributed to Bosch's business by his stimulus to their further product development and in opening up the French market for Bosch.|$|R

The study analysed three dust samples acquired from wood pellets made of various types of wood biomass. Wood pellet dust is produced when manipulating with pellets. During this process a potentially hazardous situations may occur. Biomass is chemically composed mostly of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. During straining of the biomass by heat flux, combustion initiation occurs. Also, there was a change in the composition of material throughout combustion gases production, and the amount of heat generated by a flame or flameless combustion. Measurement of fire characteristics was conducted according to ISO 5660 - 1 standard using a cone calorimeter.

40|$|The fire {{retardant}} effects of natural mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite have been investigated. As {{well as being}} entirely natural these mixtures of minerals can be considered “greener” and more environmentally friendly, in their production methods, than alternatives such as aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.

Huntite has been shown to decrease the average rate of heat release and increase the strength of the residue. Electron microscopy has shown that the huntite particles maintain their platy morphology during combustion in the cone calorimeter. The morphology of these particles helps to reduce the rate of heat release by slowing the release of flammable decomposition products to the flame. The platy shape of the huntite particles increases the strength of the residue containing higher proportions of this mineral.

50|$|Two major efforts {{occurred}} in the 1950s. One of these efforts was by G. Moore and K. Berman at General Electric. The duo used 90% H2O2 (high test peroxide, known as HTP) and polyethylene in a rod and tube grain design. They drew several significant conclusions from their work. The fuel grain had uniform burning. Grain cracks did not affect combustion, like it does with solid rocket motors. No hard starts were observed (a hard start is a pressure spike seen close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of <b>ignition,</b> typical of liquid rocket engines). The fuel surface acted as a flame holder, which encouraged stable combustion. The oxidizer could be throttled with one valve, and a high oxidizer to fuel ratio helped simplify combustion. The negative observations were low burning rates and that the thermal instability of peroxide was problematic for safety reasons. Another effort that {{occurred in}} the 1950s was development of a reverse hybrid. In a standard hybrid rocket motor, the solid material is the fuel. In a reverse hybrid rocket motor, the oxidizer is solid. William Avery of the Applied Physics Laboratory used JP and ammonium nitrate, selected for their low cost.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis thesis {{presents}} an experimental study into {{the utility of}} transient plasma ignition (TPI) of hydrocarbon fuel-air mixtures and the basic physics behind said phenomena. Transient plasma has several advantages over traditional spark ignition, consistently demonstrating reductions in ignition delay and extended lean burn capability. It is postulated that high energy electrons generated during the electrical discharge are responsible for electron impact dissociation, ionization, and fragmentation of molecules in the medium resulting in radical formation that drives the combustion process. The experiments described in this thesis illustrate TPI's effects and attempt to understand the underlying physics by looking at transient plasma induced production of radicals, ignition, and flame propagation.; Using optical diagnostic techniques {{the ability of a}} transient plasma to populate a cylindrical discharge volume with the hydroxyl radical (OH) is analyzed during combustion of stoichiometric quiescent CH 4 -air mixtures. Ground state OH production is analyzed using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF). Broadband transitions of OH near 309 and 314 nm were also used to monitor transient plasma production of OH* via optical emission spectroscopy (OES). A high speed camera was used to image ignition and flame propagation in the chamber, providing spatial and temporal resolution over the entire combustion event.; Transient plasma successfully ignited the CH 4 - air mixture, populating the discharge volume with radicals. Mean OH number densities produced by the discharge were found to reach ~ 4 x 10 ^ 14 molecules - cm^(- 3) and decay within 100 µs of <b>the</b> plasma. <b>Ignition</b> under these conditions was found to occur approximately 1 ms after the discharge along the anode, creating a cylindrically expanding flame front. TPI was found to be a truly volumetric ignition source creating multiple ignition kernels whose proximity to the anode is consistent with the region of highest field and thus maximum radical density. Additionally the rapid decay of the initial OH (as seen by the pump beam) with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of <b>ignition</b> suggests that <b>the</b> anode itself may have an important role in sustaining and enhancing combustion kinetics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPyrolysis is the {{thermochemical}} process {{that leads to}} <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> of a solid fuel and a key mechanism in flame spread and fire growth. Because polymeric materials are flammable and ubiquitous in the modern environment, the understanding of polymer pyrolysis is thus essential to tackle accidental fires. In this paper, we used transient irradiation as an external source of heat to study the process of pyrolysis and ignition of a polymer. While previous ignition studies use constant irradiation, transient irradiation is the most frequent condition found in accidental fires, but it lacks a theoretical framework since it has been ignored in the literature. Moreover, transient irradiation is a more comprehensive case for the understanding of pyrolysis where nonlinear heat transfer effects challenge the validity of solid-phase criteria for piloted ignition developed previously. We propose here that transient irradiation is the general problem to solid fuel ignition of which constant irradiation is a particular case. In order to investigate how this novel heat source influences polymer pyrolysis and flammability, numerical simulations and experiments have been conducted on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples 100  mm by 100  mm and 30  mm deep exposed {{to a range of}} parabolic pulses of irradiation. The 1 D model, coded in GPyro, uses heat and mass transfer and single-step heterogeneous chemistry, with temperature dependent properties. The predictions are compared to experiments conducted in the cone calorimeter for the constant irradiation and the Fire Propagation Apparatus for transient irradiation. The experiments validate the temperature predictions of the model and also provide <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignition.</b> <b>The</b> model then complements the experiments by calculating the mass loss rate. A series of 16 parabolic pulses (including repeats) are investigated with a range of peak irradiation from 25 to 45 kW/m 2, while <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> peak ranges from 280 to 480  s. For these pulses, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> measurements range from 300 to 483  s. The model can predict the in-depth temperature profiles with an average error lower than 9 %. Model and experiments are then combined to study the validity of the solid-phase criteria for flaming <b>ignition</b> found in <b>the</b> literature, namely critical temperature, critical mass loss rate, critical energy and critical time-energy squared. We find that of these criteria, the best predictions are provided by the critical mass loss rate followed by the critical temperature, and the worst is the critical energy. Further analysis reveals the novel concept of simultaneous threshold values. While the mass loss rate is below 3  g/m 2 and the surface temperature is below 305  °C, ignition does not occur. Therefore these threshold values when exceeded simultaneously establish <b>the</b> earliest <b>time</b> possible for ignition...|$|R

40|$|Mixtures {{of the two}} {{minerals}} huntite and hydromagnesite {{have been}} successfully used as a fire retardant additive in polymers for many years. The onset of decomposition of hydromagnesite is at a higher temperature than that of aluminium hydroxide but {{lower than that of}} magnesium hydroxide, the two most commonly used mineral fire retardants. This makes it an ideal addition to the range of materials available to polymer compounders for improving fire retardant properties. In comparison to the better known mineral fire retardants there has been little published research on the fire retardant properties of huntite and hydromagnesite. What has been published has often been commercially orientated and the limited quantity of scientific literature does not fully explain the fire retardant mechanism of these blends of minerals, often dismissing huntite as having no useful fire retardant action other than diluting the solid phase fuel. Standard thermal analysis techniques (thermal gravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infra-red analysis) have been used to characterise the thermal decomposition of huntite and hydromagnesite from a source in Turkey. This has lead {{to an understanding of the}} decomposition mechanism of the minerals in terms of mass loss, enthalpy of decomposition, and evolved gases between room temperature and 1000 °C. Hydromagnesite endothermically decomposes between about 220 °C and 500 °C, initially releasing water followed by carbon dioxide. The rate of heating and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the mechanism of carbon dioxide release. Huntite endothermically decomposes between about 450 °C and 800 °C releasing carbon dioxide in two stages. The use of the cone calorimeter to study the rate of heat release during combustion of ethylene vinyl acetate based polymer compounds has lead to an understanding of how both huntite and hydromagnesite affect the burning processes at different stages of the fire. By varying the ratio of the two minerals, hydromagnesite has been shown <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignition</b> and reduce <b>the</b> initial peak in rate of heat release, while huntite has been shown to reduce the rate of heat release later in the fire. It has been shown that huntite is far from being an inactive diluent filler. The endothermic decomposition of huntite in the later stages of the fire reduces the heat reaching underlying polymer and continues to dilute the flame with inert carbon dioxide. The platy huntite particles have been shown to align themselves in such a way that they can hinder the escape of volatiles from the decomposing polymer and also physically reinforce the inorganic ash residue...|$|R

40|$|Multi-dimensional, {{laser-based}} {{measurements of}} quantities important for obtaining {{a better understanding}} of combustion processes, particularly of temperature and of species distributions, were performed using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The main purpose of the temperature experiments was to investigate the potential of employing a two-line atomic fluorescence technique (TLAF), using indium as the tracer species, in sooting environments such as in diesel engines. The initial studies were performed in a laboratory flame in which the amount of soot was varied for investigating whether the technique suffers from strong background radiation due to heated soot particles, absorption of laser wavelengths or interference caused by poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The results indicate In-TLAF thermometry to perform well over a large range of -values. Indium is an attractive tracer candidate since both its excitation and detection wavelengths are in the visible range (410 nm and 451 nm), where absorption by hydrocarbons and other native combustion species was found to be negligible. Because of the oscillator strength of indium being high, the laser energy required is very low. This is an advantage since lasers of high power give rise either to laser-induced incandescence (LII) from soot particles or to strong LIF from PAH. The broad temperature sensitivity range, some 700 – 3000 K, of the technique when indium atoms are employed allows measurements to be performed in most practical combustion environments. In fuel-rich flames the seeding efficiency also increases, since the loss of active species due to oxidation there plays only a subordinate role. This is an advantage, since it permits sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to be achieved with use of a lower seeding concentration minimising the effects of the seeded species on the combustion chemistry. This makes In-TLAF highly attractive for thermometry applications in fuel-rich and turbulent combustion processes. In-TLAF may well prove to be a good candidate for future measurements in diesel engines, where temperature information is of crucial importance for further development of engine design. Engine measurements were performed using a high-speed laser and camera system. The laser cluster and the framing camera employed are able to capture eight images within 50, making studies of time and spatially resolved combustion events possible. Concentration measurements were performed in engines of three types; a spark-ignition (SI) engine, a gasoline-direct-injection (GDI) engine and a homogeneous-charge- compression-ignition (HCCI) engine. The high-speed system was used so as to be able to perform true single-cycle-resolved measurements in the engines, all the data being recorded in a single engine cycle without any averaging effects caused by cycle-to-cycle variations. Studies of the sort are impossible to perform using a system that captures only single-shot images from subsequent cycles. The detection of single-cycle-resolved images of fuel and OH distributions was performed initially in a lab-top SI-engine with the aim of investigating the applicability of the technique. The same technique was then applied to a GDI engine at the Volvo Car Corporation. In that engine, fuel transport from the start of injection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of <b>ignition</b> was studied, along with flame propagation using both OH and fuel-tracer PLIF. The onset and development of combustion was also studied in the HCCI engine located at the Division of Combustion Engines in Lund, using fuel-tracer PLIF. The main goal there being to capture the appearance and growth of auto-ignition kernels for investigating whether any flame propagation occurs in a combustion process of this type. Cycle-to-cycle variations were also studied by comparing different cycles. To investigate whether a fuel island in a two-dimensional image is isolated or simply looks like an island due to wrinkling effects in and out the laser sheet, an experiment was performed in which 3 D data was recorded. The topology of the fuel distribution can also be studied by obtaining measurements in three dimensions. From such experimental data, spatial gradients in all three directions can be calculated, providing information of interesting to modellers...|$|R

The input data consisted of crank angle resolved mixture temperature and composition as well as cylinder pressure during the compression stroke. <b>The</b> <b>ignition</b> expression developed was calibrated to simulate the combustion process in gasoline HCCI engines with internal EGR trapping. It is proven that <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> expression properly manages to predict the trends in auto-ignition timing when varying the engine speed, the temperature at IVC, the cylinder pressure at IVC, the air/fuel ratio or the RGF, when compared with results from the detailed-chemistry HCCI model. A comparison with results from HCCI engine experiments shows that HCCI modeling applying <b>the</b> derived <b>ignition</b> expression can accurately predict in-cylinder processes and global engine parameters typical for HCCI combustion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Authors of {{this work}} carry out the {{analysis}} of applicability frameworks of various ignition criteria for modelling representatives of initiating explosives, secondary explosives and pyrotechnic mixed structures. It is established, that ignition criterion is energy of a pulse which value corresponds 50 % of ignition probability at short time of influences and the small sizes of a beam on a surface of substance, and in case a large sizes of beam – density of energy. In the field of long <b>time</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> criterion is power or density of power accordingly. It is necessary to understand values of energy W 05 as power thresholds of ignition (PTI), density of energy Н 05, capacities I 05 and density of capacity q 05...|$|R

3000|$|We {{note that}} <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> delay <b>time</b> {{can be defined}} as <b>the</b> <b>time</b> needed by <b>the</b> system to {{increase}} its temperature of 10 K in comparison with the inlet temperature[19]; therefore, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> evolution of mass fraction of OH radical at varying intensities of turbulent mixing, given in Figure 2, can give an idea on the influence of the mixing intensity on the combustion temperature and, therefore, their influence on NO x [...] formation. Figure 2 shows that the effect of mixing <b>times</b> on <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> delay (i.e., on the temperature) becomes less discernible at large mixing times.|$|R
