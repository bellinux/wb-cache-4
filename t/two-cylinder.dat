5|$|The {{completion}} of the final locomotive, No. 34110 66 Squadron, in January 1951 was delayed for several months pending consideration of proposals from British Railways management for a major modification to a standard <b>two-cylinder</b> design without the chain-driven valve gear., but the locomotive entered service as Bulleid intended.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum {{featured}} {{a collection of}} historic trucks, cars and other items related to the trucking operation, with a special focus on trucking in the 1950s. Many of the historic vehicles on display were noted for their rarity or otherwise unique quality. These include the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1902 Merry Oldsmobile, and a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company five-to-seven ton dump truck, one of only 55 Pierce-Arrow trucks produced. The displays included a 1916 Mack Paddy Wagon, a 1929 Diamond T truck, a 1931 Ford Model AA Service Car, a 1936 Ford Roadster Deluxe and a Model T Ford Tank Truck. A 1953 Fageol moving van with original owner's banner was located near some surreys and carriages. Other early period vehicles on display included a 1912 Autocar <b>two-cylinder</b> transit bus, a 1914 Trumbull, a 1915 Barker, and a 1917 Republic Model 10 1-ton express and a 1920 3 ½ ton Model AC Mack.|$|E
25|$|The <b>two-cylinder</b> Stirling with Ross yoke is a <b>two-cylinder</b> {{stirling}} engine (positioned at 0°, not 90°) connected using a special yoke. The engine configuration/yoke setup {{was invented by}} Andy Ross.|$|E
25|$|The KFM 107 is a <b>two-cylinder,</b> two-stroke, single ignition, {{horizontally}} opposed {{aircraft engine}} designed for ultralight aircraft and motor gliders.|$|E
25|$|A {{good number}} of these {{locomotives}} were to survive throughout the LMS NCC period although many were rebuilt to <b>two-cylinder</b> simple expansion.|$|E
25|$|Since {{entering}} the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on <b>two-cylinder</b> machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas {{was very different}} from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's <b>two-cylinder</b> models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>two-cylinder</b> {{motorcycles}} {{and motor}} scooters had two contact points feeding twin coils each connected directly {{to one of}} the two sparking plugs without a distributor; e.g. the BSA Thunderbolt and Triumph Tigress.|$|E
25|$|The ABC 8hp is an 8hp (6kW) <b>two-cylinder</b> {{aero engine}} {{designed}} by the noted British engineer Granville Bradshaw for use in ultralight aircraft. The engine was derived from a specially tuned motorcycle unit and was built by ABC Motors, first running in 1923.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Vittorio Jano {{created his}} first straight-eight-cylinder engine for Alfa Romeo, the 1987cc P2, with common {{crankcase}} and four plated-steel <b>two-cylinder</b> blocks, {{which won the}} first World Championship ever in 1925. Although it was a straight-8, the 8C designation was not used.|$|E
25|$|The Banshee is a built mostly out of {{composite}} material (Kevlar and glass-reinforced plastic) with a tailess delta wing platform. The first models used a 26hp 342 cc Normalair-Garrett <b>two-cylinder</b> two-stroke driving a pusher propeller. Performance was 35-185 kt with an endurance from 1–3 hours. Flight control is by two elevons.|$|E
25|$|The first prototype, {{powered by}} a <b>two-cylinder</b> {{horizontally}} opposed engine, flew in 1919, receiving its Airworthiness Certificate in December that year. Production aircraft were {{powered by a}} six-cylinder Anzani air-cooled radial, and four more aircraft followed before Austin abandoned aircraft production in 1920, when it realised that the postwar depression was severely limiting aircraft sales.|$|E
25|$|By 1975, Peugeot {{had taken}} over Citroën (forming the PSA Group), and the 104 coupé {{bodyshell}} then {{formed the basis of}} the 602cc <b>two-cylinder</b> engined Citroën LN. In 1982 this car was fitted with the more modern 652cc engine of the Visa in 1983 to become the LNA, before production finally ceased in 1985.|$|E
25|$|A single {{air pump}} for the {{locomotive}} and train air brakes was fitted to the fireman's (left) side, with air tanks under the running boards on both sides. Like all larger North American coal-burning locomotives of the time, an automatic stoker was fitted; the <b>two-cylinder</b> engine to drive this {{was under the}} cab floor on the fireman's side.|$|E
25|$|The single-cylinder bikes have {{a strong}} {{following}} and are thought by many of their riders to be better off-roaders than the heavier boxer-engined bikes. Like the larger <b>two-cylinder</b> models, they offer significant capacity to carry gear and supplies over long distances. Their versatility is attractive to riders who intend to spend weeks, months, even years travelling on two wheels.|$|E
25|$|A {{booster engine}} for steam {{locomotives}} {{is a small}} <b>two-cylinder</b> steam engine back-gear-connected to the trailing truck axle on the locomotive or, if none, the lead truck on the tender. A rocking idler gear permits it {{to be put into}} operation by the engineer. It would drive one axle only and could be non-reversible with one idler gear or reversible with two idler gears.|$|E
25|$|A {{surviving}} Flivver {{resides in}} the Henry Ford Museum. In 1991, EAA Chapter 159 from Midland, Michigan donated a replica to the EAA AirVenture Museum. The replica was built in 1989 from careful inspection of the original prototype and advice from Otto C. Koppen, the original designer, although it was powered by a <b>two-cylinder</b> Franklin engine. A second replica is {{on display at the}} Florida Air Museum.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} {{exist in}} two general groups. The first preserves the two-stroke-engine sound by tuning the original <b>two-cylinder</b> engine for higher performance or using a two-stroke propulsion unit designed for another car, {{such as the}} 1000cc Wartburg). Since the Trabant is light——a small increase in engine power can rapidly increase its power-to-weight ratio. Some enthusiasts have used the durable, easily tuned Trabant for rally {{and other types of}} racing.|$|E
25|$|This type is {{mentioned}} {{here because it}} is very familiar in comics and other drawings, as a wrongly-drawn twin-hose <b>two-cylinder</b> aqualung regulator, with one wide hose coming out of each cylinder top to the mouthpiece with no apparent regulator valve, much more often than a correctly-drawn twin-hose regulator (and often of such breathing sets being used by combat frogmen): see Frogman#Errors about frogmen found in public media. It would not work in the real world.|$|E
25|$|The M.23 was a small, {{conventional}} low-wing cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage, the mainwheels {{mounted on}} a cranked axle, plus a tailskid. The fin and rudder assembly were broader and shorter {{than that of the}} M.19, though the shape varied with sub-type. A wide variety of engines were fitted, with power ranging from the 28kW (38hp) ABC Scorpion <b>two-cylinder</b> motor to the 112kW (150hp) of the seven-cylinder Siemens Sh 14a radial.|$|E
25|$|The Panhard 24 is {{a compact}} two-door coupé {{automobile}} produced between 1964 and 1967 by French manufacturer Panhard. It was {{powered by a}} front-mounted air-cooled <b>two-cylinder</b> boxer motor: the basic design of this unconventional engine dated back to the 1940s. In 1965 a lengthened Panhard 24 was launched and promoted as a two-door four- or five-seat saloon. Plans for a four-door version which might have enabled the car more effectively to replace the commercially successful Panhard PL 17 saloon were never implemented, however.|$|E
25|$|In 1905 Adolphe Clément-Bayard {{created the}} Diatto-Clément Societa Anonima in {{partnership}} with Diatto, who had been coachbuilders in Turin since 1835. The cars, known as Torinos were built in Turin under licence from Clément. The first cars were the 20-25HP which used 3,770cc four-cylinder engines. These were followed by 10-12HP (1,884cc <b>two-cylinder)</b> and 14-18HP (2,724cc four-cylinder) models. This series was a success and {{was followed by a}} six-cylinder model. In 1909 Clément-Bayard left the business and the company was renamed Societa Fonderie Officine Frejus.|$|E
25|$|The Port Victoria aircraft, {{designed}} by W.H. Sayers, was designated P.V.7. It {{was a very}} small single bay tractor biplane, of sesquiplane configuration, with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing. The wings featured the same high-lift section as used in previous Port Victoria aircraft, and were fitted with ailerons only on the upper wing. It was intended, as was the competing Eastchurch design, to use a 45hp (34kW) geared ABC Gnat <b>two-cylinder</b> air-cooled engine. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Empire had a {{long history}} of {{progress}} in the development of machinery. As early as in the eighteenth century Ivan I. Polzunov constructed the first <b>two-cylinder</b> steam engine in the world, while Ivan P. Kulibin created a human-powered vehicle that had a flywheel, a brake, a gearbox, and roller bearings. One of the world's first tracked vehicles was invented by Fyodor A. Blinov in 1877. In 1896, the Yakovlev engine factory and the Freze carriage-manufacturing workshop manufactured the first Russian petrol-engine automobile, the Yakovlev & Freze.|$|E
25|$|Built by Caird & Company of Greenock, Scotland, and {{launched}} on 18 December 1872, the SS Bokhara had a <b>two-cylinder</b> compound inverted steam engine and was registered in London. The passenger liner travelled mainly to India and the Far East and in 1875 had its registry transferred to Greenock. On the ship's maiden voyage, in 1873, it was stranded on an uncharted rock off Hong Kong and after eventually refloating, {{it had to}} be docked at Kowloon for repairs. In 1884 the ship was used as a transport vessel for soldiers in the Mahdist War.|$|E
25|$|Duchess of Montrose {{was fitted}} with a triple-expansion steam engine {{incorporating}} four cylinders (two high-, one intermediate-, and one low-pressure) arranged in tandem to drive two cranks. This arrangement was considered more efficient than the conventional <b>two-cylinder</b> compound steam engine and provided greater manoeuvrability at piers. The use of relatively small paddle wheels, intended to save wear and tear, meant that Duchess of Montrose had a diminutive paddlebox and, {{in conjunction with a}} very vertical funnel, she was easily recognisable amongst the Clyde fleet. She featured saloons fore and aft and an open bow under the promenade deck.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{class leader}} N 110 was {{equipped}} with a <b>two-cylinder</b> Franklin booster engine which drove the trailing truck axle. Based {{on the success of}} this device, VR built all but two of the much larger X class 2-8-2s with booster engines. VR also modified the design of the Delta trailing truck on the second (1930-31 built) batch of N class locomotives to enable easy retrofitting of booster engines. Despite this, no further boosters were ever fitted, and in 1945, N 110's booster was removed and fitted to one of the two non-booster equipped X class locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} required regular and, {{compared to}} a diesel-electric engine, frequent service and overhaul (often at government-regulated intervals in Europe and the US). Alterations and upgrades regularly occurred during overhauls. New appliances were added, unsatisfactory features removed, cylinders improved or replaced. Almost {{any part of the}} locomotive, including boilers, was replaced or upgraded. When service or upgrades got too expensive the locomotive was traded off or retired. On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad two 2-10-2 locomotives were dismantled; the boilers were placed onto two new Class T 4-8-2 locomotives and the residual wheel machinery made into a pair of Class U 0-10-0 switchers with new boilers. Union Pacific's fleet of 3-cylinder 4-10-2 engines were converted into <b>two-cylinder</b> engines in 1942, because of high maintenance problems.|$|E
25|$|The Epps 1907 Monoplane was a {{pioneering}} aircraft built and flown in 1907 by Ben T. Epps of Athens, Georgia from an original design. The aircraft consisted {{of an open}} framework suspended below a wire-braced monoplane wing. The undercarriage consisted of three bicycle wheels, one {{at the front of}} this frame, and two behind it. A buggy seat was located beneath the wing for the pilot. A 15-horsepower (11kW) <b>two-cylinder</b> Anzani motorcycle engine was mounted behind the seat and drove a two-bladed propeller from an exhaust fan mounted pusher-fashion behind the wing's trailing edge. A biplane elevator unit was carried on struts {{at the front of the}} aircraft, and a single rudder on struts to its rear. The airframe was made from scrap timber collected from a sawmill, with the flying surfaces covered in cotton. Only the undersurfaces of the wings were covered.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a {{relatively}} advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s many small Western cars (such as the Renault) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, <b>two-cylinder</b> four-stroke engine. The Trabant had a front, transversely-mounted engine and front-wheel drive {{in an era when}} many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car's two-stroke engine made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|The CFM Shadow is a two-seat {{ultralight}} of pod and boom layout, either factory or home-built from kits. It is a {{high wing}} aircraft, with a short fuselage constructed of Fibrelam with a fibreglass nose cone and plywood sides, seating two in tandem in an enclosed cockpit. Dual control can be fitted and was standard on later models. The fuselage carries a tricycle undercarriage, with a castoring nosewheel; wheel fairings are an option. A Rotax <b>two-cylinder</b> two-stroke engine is mounted, exposed, immediately behind this pod in pusher configuration. The unusual empennage is carried on a fine aluminium boom and consists of an inverted narrow rectangular tail fin and large rudder below the boom plus a swept tailplane with small tapered upright end plate fins. The elevators are full span, with electrically operated trim tabs. All rear surfaces have aluminium structures covered with polyester fabric.|$|E
25|$|The {{motorcycle}} is a single-track, two-wheeled {{motor vehicle}} powered by an engine. Although the first gasoline/petrol motorcycle powered by an {{internal combustion engine}} was built in 1885 by a German named Gottlieb Daimler, his {{may not have been}} the first motorcycle. Ironically, Daimler's motorcycle used a four-stroke internal combustion engine that wasn't of his own creation, instead having to rely upon an engine built by Nicolaus August Otto which he simply mounted onto the frame of a bicycle. Furthermore, if the definition of a motorcycle is inclusive of a steam engine and not exclusive to an internal combustion engine, then the world's first motorcycle may either have been American; a coal-powered, <b>two-cylinder,</b> steam-driven motorcycle known as the Roper steam velocipede invented by Sylvester Howard Roper in 1867; or perhaps a French one, independently invented by a competing claim by French blacksmith Pierre Michaux and engineer Louis-Guillaume Perreaux, who invented the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede in 1868.|$|E
500|$|Two {{different}} types of engines were used with this class. Twelve ships received <b>two-cylinder</b> horizontal return connecting rod engines built by Maudslay, Sons and Field while the remaining six got <b>two-cylinder</b> horizontal trunk engines from John Penn and Sons. Each engine powered a single [...] propeller. The engines produced between [...] which gave the ships a maximum speed between [...] Three cylindrical boilers provided steam to the engines, although the working pressure varied; the ships with trunk engines used [...] while the other engines used [...] The ships carried [...] of coal although no range figures are available.|$|E
