50|$|Hydro Power Company Gorna Arda is a Bulgarian company, {{established}} in 1999 by the National Electricity Company and the Turkish Ceylan Holding. It is established after {{the signing of}} an intergovernmental agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey for a long-term barter. The Turkish side constructs roads and a cascade of hydropower plants in Bulgaria, and Bulgaria exports energy in return. Three hydro power plants are foreseen {{to be included in}} the cascade (Madan, Sarnitsa and Ardino), placed on the upper stream of Arda river. The groundbreaking was made in the end of 1999, planning to finish the construction of the cascade in 2006. Soon after that the project was frozen due to contradictions between the shareholders.In 2008 the Austrian company EVN expressed its interest in the Gorna Arda project. The company operates on the Bulgarian market since 2005 executing business activities in the field of distribution and <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in South-Eastern Bulgaria. On September 2, 2009 the government of the Republic of Bulgaria appointed Hydro Power Company Gorna Arda AD as the investor in the Gorna Arda Cascade. The Council of Ministers approved a letter of support for the realization of the investment project. This letter is not a state guarantee, does not burden the state budget and does not raise any financial obligations for the state. NEK, EVN and Alpine Bau expressed their wish to be shareholders in HEC Gorna Arda. In the beginning of 2010 Аlpine Bau reviewed its business development plans and decided to withdraw from the project. Thus only shareholders in the project left NEK and EVN. On July 19, 2010 in the Bulgarian Embassy in Vienna, in the presence of the Bulgarian Prime Minister Mr. Boyko Borissov, shareholders agreement for construction and operation of hydro power cascade Gorna Arda was signed. This contract arranged the collaboration base between NEK and EVN. On behalf Bulgaria the document was signed by Krasimir Parvanov, the CEO of NEK EAD, and on behalf of Austria it was signed by Burkhard Hofer, Chairperson of the Board of Directors in EVN. The establishment of the new company proves the will of EVN and NEK to restore a long time planned project for a hydro power cascade on the upper stream of Arda river in South-Eastern Bulgaria. At the moment the work is based on the technical redesign. The plan is in the region of Madan, Ardino and Kitnitsa to be constructed plants with total capacity up to 170 MW. Up to 350 GWh per year electricity will come from those plants in the Bulgarian network, this amount covers the electricity needs of over 100 000 households.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{generation}} and network investment in a com-petitive electricity system.

We take up this question and apply some formalism formerly developed by O’Neill and co-authors for the unit com-mitment problem in order to construct multipart tariffs that insure the adequate development of the resources both in generation and the grid.

40|$|Many {{countries}} have followed {{a policy of}} being self-sufficient in electricity.

40|$|The {{electricity}} sector worldwide {{is undergoing}} a fundamental transformation of its institutional structure {{as a consequence of}} the complex interactions of political, economic and technological forces. The way the industry is organized is changing from vertically integrated monopolies to unbundled structures that favor market mechanisms. This process in Europe, known as the liberalization process, has had a wide impact on the European electricity industry. The focus of this dissertation is an analysis of the role <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> power exchanges in the recently liberalized <b>electricity</b> markets <b>of</b> Europe. In the context of creating 'a' competitive electricity market at a European level, the key questions considered are the functioning of these power exchanges with respect to electricity characteristics, market design and regulatory framework. In Europe, very little attention has been paid to the role of these new marketplaces and to the issue of market design in general. Hence the main purpose of this work was to analyze how these marketplaces facilitate the <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> and the role they can play in the construction of a pan-European competitive electricity market. An analysis of power exchange requires taking into account the 'double-duality' of such institutions. One, power exchanges are both a market and an institution. As a market they facilitate the <b>trading</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> and determine an equilibrium price. As an institution power exchanges have their own objectives and constraints, and play a role in the market design <b>of</b> the overall <b>electricity</b> market. Two, the relationship between electricity power exchanges and liberalization is neither linear nor one way: liberalization encourages the birth of such marketplaces yet marketplaces are more than the results of such process, they are also a driving force of the liberalization process.

The results show that the percentage requirement is a very imprecise instrument as to increase the provision of green electricity. In none of the cases considered will an increase of the percentage requirement in a country necessarily result in an increase in the generation of green electricity in the country itself. When opening for trade, the results show that the increase of the percentage requirement in one country can {{have a negative effect on}} green electricity generation in this country, but a positive effect in the other country.

40|$|The {{regulation}} on cross-border {{exchanges of}} {{electricity in the}} European Union is meant to enhance the <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> between Member States, by facilitating access to the network and improving the management of congestion at the interconnections. This paper presents a computational model that embeds these two features. The problem is cast {{in the form of}} a two-stage equilibrium between regional Regulators. In the first stage, they decide on the allocation of their regional network costs between generators and customers. Either they maximise their regional welfare non-cooperatively (Nash equilibrium), or they centralise the decision as a super-regulator (leading to a cooperative equilibrium). In the second-stage equilibrium, the consequences of first-stage's decisions are assessed by modelling the energy market as the result of imperfect competition equilibrium on competitive market, coupled with regulated pricing on the domestic less competitive markets. The '' rules '' that come out of the first-stage game largely influence the final equilibrium. We illustrate this on an extensive numerical example, showing that the model behaves properly and identifying policy issues worth of further investigations. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
