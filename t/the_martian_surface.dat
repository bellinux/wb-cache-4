5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008. On September 28, 2015, NASA announced the presence of briny flowing salt water on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{proposed}} that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which {{is thought to have}} originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
50|$|Russia is {{evaluating}} {{the option of}} using a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to power the science instruments, and a radioisotope heater unit (RHU) to provide thermal control on <b>the</b> frozen <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R
25|$|The mission studied <b>the</b> entire <b>Martian</b> <b>surface,</b> atmosphere, and interior, and {{returned}} more {{data about the}} red planet than all previous Mars missions combined. The data has been archived and remains available publicly.|$|R
50|$|Glaciers, loosely {{defined as}} patches of {{currently}} or recently flowing ice, {{are thought to}} be present across large but restricted areas of <b>the</b> modern <b>Martian</b> <b>surface,</b> and are inferred to have been more widely distributed at times in the past.|$|R
5|$|The current {{understanding}} of planetary habitability—the {{ability of a}} world to develop environmental conditions favorable {{to the emergence of}} life—favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.|$|E
5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over large areas of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b> Usually chlorides are the last minerals {{to come out of}} solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} marine {{catches up with}} Campbell in the central {{computer}} processing sector of the base, Campbell is mortally wounded and only has enough strength to say that Kelly has taken Campbell's BFG 9000 weapon before expiring. Kelly then begins to taunt the marine in a demonic voice. The marine eventually faces off with Kelly in the central computer core, revealing Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base. The marine is able to kill Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 before proceeding deeper under <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> to Site 3, the archaeological dig site where the Soul Cube was unearthed. At the primary excavation site, the marine discovers the Hellmouth, defended by Hell's mightiest warrior, the Cyberdemon. Using the Soul Cube, the marine defeats the Cyberdemon in combat, and the Soul Cube then seals the Hellmouth. The ending cut scene shows the reinforcements from Earth arriving at the base to discover the carnage. They find the marine alive, but discover that Swann has died. They are, however, unable to locate Betruger, who in the final scene is shown in Hell, reincarnated as a dragon-like demon.|$|E
40|$|Sublimation {{of water}} ice is more {{effective}} than evaporation of spoprtion water at the same temperature. Therefore, water in the form of ice, must, over geological time-scales, have left in <b>the</b> upper <b>martian</b> <b>surface</b> (m-scale) at mid- and low-latitudes, leaving sorption water as a possible physical form of unstable subsurface water. Adsorption water is "liquid-like" at these temperatures (in the sense of a 2 D-liquid). This property is the reason for the specific importance of physioabsorbed water under martian conditions. It is shown that unfrozen adsorption water can cause numerous physical, chemical, and possible also biological processes in <b>the</b> upper <b>martian</b> <b>surface</b> and may be responsible for a number of its properties...|$|R
40|$|Mars Odyssey {{has given}} strong {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} water in <b>the</b> upper <b>martian</b> <b>surface</b> at equatorial latitudes. The water content, which corresponds to the hydrogen in the soil, can regionally reach values up to about 15 %. This water is mainly in the form of structurally and partially irreversibly bound "crystal" water, and of reversibly bound and partially unfrozen adsorption water. This adsorption water, which has "liquid-like" properties as a twodimensional fluid or film, can trigger-in the presence of ultraviolet light and in concentrations similar to what has been measured on Mars-photocatalytic processes that are important for <b>martian</b> <b>surface</b> chemistry. <b>The</b> consequences of the diurnally variable presence of adsorption water on the chemistry and hypothetical biological processes at and in <b>the</b> upper <b>martian</b> <b>surface</b> at equatorial and mid-latitudes are discussed in terms of water-related environmental aspects for chemical and hypothetical life processes on Mars...|$|R
5000|$|The orbital {{altitude}} {{required to}} maintain an areosynchonous orbit is approximately 17000 km. If a satellite in areosynchonous orbit were {{to be used as}} a communication relay link, it [...] "would experience communications ranges of 17000 to 20000 km" [...] to various points on <b>the</b> visible <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R
25|$|HRSC camera {{has been}} {{consistently}} mapping <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> with unprecedented resolution and has taken dozens of pictures.|$|E
25|$|Several teams, {{including}} Jonathan Rothberg, and J. Craig Venter, are separately developing {{solutions for}} sequencing alien DNA directly on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 the K–Ar {{method was}} used by the Mars Curiosity rover to date a rock on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface,</b> the first time a rock has been dated from its mineral {{ingredients}} while situated on another planet.|$|E
50|$|The {{comparatively}} few known Martian meteorites {{have provided}} {{insight into the}} geochemical composition of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> crust, although <b>the</b> unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on <b>the</b> diverse <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> has meant {{that they do not}} provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> lithosphere. As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.|$|R
40|$|The Lowellian canal {{network has}} been {{compared}} {{with the results of}} Mariner 9 photography of Mars. A small number of canals may correspond to rift valleys, ridge systems, crater chains, and linear surface albedo markings. But the vast bulk of classical canals correspond neither to topographic nor to albedo features, and appear to have no relation to <b>the</b> real <b>Martian</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Materials Adherence Experiment (MAE) was a {{material}} science experiment conducted during NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission. It {{consisted of a}} small module mounted to Pathfinder's rover Sojourner that examined <b>the</b> effects of <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> dust on solar cells.|$|R
25|$|On 4 March 2015, the ISRO {{reported}} that MOM's methane sensors were functioning normally and are studying Mars' albedo, the reflectivity of the planet's surface. The Mars Colour Camera was also returning new images of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2020, a Roscosmos-built lander (ExoMars 2020 surface platform) is {{to deliver}} the ESA-built ExoMars Rover to <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b> The rover will also include some Roscosmos built instruments. The second mission {{operations}} and communications will be led by ALTEC's Rover Control Centre in Italy.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} meteorites {{thought to have}} {{originated}} from Mars have been catalogued from around the world, including the Nakhlites. These are considered to have been ejected by the impact of another large body colliding with <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b> They then travelled through the solar system for an unknown period of time before penetrating the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Even so, high-altitude {{orographic}} clouds frequently drift {{over the}} Olympus Mons summit, and airborne Martian dust is still present. Although <b>the</b> average <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> atmospheric pressure {{is less than}} one percent of Earth's, the much lower gravity on Mars increases the atmosphere's scale height; in other words, Mars's atmosphere is expansive and does not drop off in density with height as sharply as Earth's.|$|R
50|$|Glaciers, loosely {{defined as}} patches of {{currently}} or recently flowing ice, {{are thought to}} be present across large but restricted areas of <b>the</b> modern <b>Martian</b> <b>surface,</b> and are inferred to have been more widely distributed at times in the past. Lobate convex features on the surface known as viscous flow features and lobate debris aprons, which show the characteristics of non-Newtonian flow, are now almost unanimously regarded as true glaciers.|$|R
40|$|New radiometrically {{determined}} ages of Martian meteorites add to {{the growing}} number with crystallization ages <~ 1. 4 Ga. The observation of mainly geologically young ages for <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> meteorites, <b>the</b> only exception being the ~ 4. 5 Ga ALH 84001 [1], is paradoxical when viewed in context of a <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> thought to be mostly much older as inferred from the surface density of meteorite craters [2]. There appears {{to be at least}} a twofold difference between the observed ages of Martian meteorites and their expected ages as inferred from <b>the</b> ages of <b>Martian</b> <b>surfaces</b> obtained from crater densities...|$|R
25|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> {{is deeply}} covered by dust {{as fine as}} talcum powder. The global {{predominance}} of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over {{many areas of the}} planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the iron(III) oxide-hydroxide mineral goethite.|$|E
25|$|Launched on December 4, 1996 by NASA {{aboard a}} Delta II booster {{a month after}} the Mars Global Surveyor was launched, it landed on July 4, 1997 on Mars's Ares Vallis, in a region called Chryse Planitia in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. The lander then opened, exposing the rover which {{conducted}} many experiments on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{scientist}} {{believed that}} the lander's thrusters splashed a pocket of brine from just below <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> onto the landing strut during the vehicle's landing. The salts would then have absorbed water vapor from the air, which would have explained how they appeared to grow in size during the first 44 sols (Martian days) before slowly evaporating as Mars temperature dropped.|$|E
5000|$|Planet Mars {{was once}} a paradise, until a nuclear war made <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> uninhabitable. <b>The</b> <b>Martians</b> moved underground, only coming to the surface to use the [...] "Transit Tubes" [...] (which Earth {{scientists}} mistook for <b>Martian</b> canals). Under <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>Martian</b> technology flourished, and continues to do so underneath the planet.|$|R
40|$|A {{synthesis}} of a diverse suite of observations of H 2 O-related landforms that are possible Mars analogs from terrestrial polar regions (Devon Island in the Arctic; the Dry Valleys of Antarctica) {{put into question}} any requirement for extended episode(s) of warm and wet climate in Mars past. Geologically transient episodes of localized H 2 O cycling, forced by exogenic impacts, enhanced endogenic heat flow, and/or orbit-driven short-term local environmental change under an otherwise cold, low pressure (= 10 (exp 2) mbar) global climate, may be sufficient to account for <b>the</b> <b>martian</b> <b>surface's</b> exposed record of aqueous activity. A Mars that was only sometimes locally warm and wet while remaining climatically cold throughout its history is consistent with results (difficulties) encountered in modeling efforts attempting to support warm martian climate hypotheses. Possible analogs from terrestrial cold climate regions for the recent gully features on Mars also illustrate how transient localized aqueous activity might, under specific circumstances, also occur on Mars under the present frigid global climatic regime...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} simulation, {{based on}} Mariner 9 data, was performed for the thermal characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> atmospheric <b>surface</b> boundary layer in clear and dust-filled conditions. A radiative transfer model {{consisting of the}} atmospheric enthalpy rate equation, the radiative flux integrated over the 0. 2 - 50 microns, the solid angle interval, and 0. 50 km altitudes, broken into 52 levels. Mariner 9 IR data for CO 2 absorption lines {{were included in the}} form of a temperture-dependent equation, while the line-widths were interpreted in terms of the pressure dependene as well as temperature. The lines covered the regions from 1 - 50 microns and varying conditions of dust content in the atmosphere. Attention was given to the thermal coupling between the ground and the atmosphere. It was found that convective heat exchange develops quickly due to radiative heating of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> desert <b>surface,</b> but does not cool the surface because of the attenuated atmosphere. The model predictd the 100 K temperature variations in the dusty atmosphere, as observed by the Viking thermal mapper. It is suggested that radiative flux convergence is as important as convection at equivalent efficiencies...|$|R
25|$|In March 2004 it was {{suggested}} that the unique Kaidun meteorite, which landed in Yemen on March 12, 1980, may have originated on the Martian moon of Phobos. Because Phobos has similarities to C-type asteroids and because the Kaidun meteorite is a carbonaceous chondrite, Kaidun is not a Martian meteorite in the strict sense. However, it may contain small fragments of material from <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|A team of Russian and American {{scientists}} {{proposed that}} the radioresistance of D. radiodurans had a Martian origin. Evolution of the microorganism could have taken place on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> until it was delivered to Earth on a meteorite. However, apart from its resistance to radiation, Deinococcus is genetically and biochemically very similar to other terrestrial life forms, arguing against an extraterrestrial origin not common to them.|$|E
25|$|The Mars Mission {{includes}} liftoff {{from the}} ISTC, a slingshot around the moon for a gravity-assisted boost, {{a brief period}} of simulated hypersleep (to pass the lengthy time required to reach Mars), and a descent for landing on <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> <b>surface,</b> where riders manually control the vehicle with a joystick. As a training exercise, the mission contains several unexpected situations that add to the drama.|$|E
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to the {{establishment}} of the Planetary Observer program and the initiation of the Mars Observer project (scheduled for 1990), its scientific objectives, and plans for operations. The Mars Observer mission will provide a spacecraft platform about Mars from which <b>the</b> entire <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> and atmosphere may be mapped for at least one Martian year. This first Planetary Observer mission will reveal how a series of low-cost missions can be planned and implemented to fit within constrained NASA budget for planetary operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of Mars as observed by the Viking infrared thermal mapper (IRTM) is considered. The IRTM is a 28 -channel, 4 -telescope radiometer that operated in six spectral bands. The studies considered include observations from the interplanetary phase through data collection on November 7, 1976. During this interval, thermal mapping of <b>the</b> whole <b>Martian</b> <b>surface</b> has been possible. Attention {{is given to}} polar temperatures, global albedos, predawn temperatures, a thermal inertia contour map, geometry considerations, clouds, aspects of predawn warming, and observations of earth...|$|R
40|$|Medium {{spectral}} resolution (20 kaysers) infrared measurements of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> disk made between 2900 and 5600 kaysers from the NASA Lear Airborne Observatory {{have been successfully}} compared with predictions derived from a model of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> soil and atmosphere. Modeling of <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> atmosphere permitted <b>the</b> extraction of <b>Martian</b> soil reflectance in the CO 2 bands centered at 3657 kaysers. Three Martian soil analogs previously considered acceptable - limonite, montmorillonite, and basalt - were analyzed to determine the optical complex indices of refraction in the same range as the airborne observations, for mathematical modeling. A characteristic surface particle size approximately 1 to 3 microns diameter is indicated. It is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Martian</b> soil <b>surface</b> near-infrared optical properties are consistent with a soil composition similar to montmorillonite or limonite, mixed with a basalt...|$|R
