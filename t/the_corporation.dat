5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by <b>the</b> <b>corporation</b> and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and <b>the</b> <b>corporation.</b> <b>The</b> <b>corporation</b> is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river.

5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and <b>the</b> <b>corporation</b> over the deal.

Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 trees to help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 trees to the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. The dispute over maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; <b>the</b> <b>corporation</b> argued that green timber had been used in the original construction work and claimed that they had spent £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E

40|$|In 2012, {{the impact}} of phoenix {{activity}} on the Australia&# 146;s market economy was estimated by PWC to {{be as high as}} $ 3. 19 billion per annum. The aim of the thesis is to assess the effectiveness of the current operation of the regulatory regime in curbing phoenix activities in Australia, with particular reference to <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act 2001 (Cth) (&# 147;Corporations Act&# 148;). In particular, the thesis seeks to explore whether a legal definition for the term &# 147;phoenix activity&# 148; and specific legal consequences for engaging in phoenix activity should be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act. <b>The</b> specific legal consequences considered include self-initiated remedies for early intervention of phoenix activities and proactive remedies for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (&# 147;ASIC&# 148;) to take the appropriate regulatory actions. The significance of the thesis is to establish an appropriate theoretical framework to assess the effectiveness of the current laws in dealing with phoenix activities, and to propose law reform within <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act in order to combat phoenix activities. The theoretical framework chosen for the thesis is a combination of Ayres and Braithwaite&# 146;s pyramid of enforcement strategies and the DEFEAT test, which consists of Deterrence, Efficiency, Fairness, Expertise, Accountability and Transparency as factors in assessing the effectiveness of the current laws in dealing with phoenix activities. The thesis concludes by presenting five law reform recommendations with respect to <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act: (1) to propose a legal definition for the term &# 147;phoenix activity&# 148; within s 9 of <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act; (2) to include commercial transactions which led to, or may lead to, phoenix activities in the definition of uncommercial transactions under s 588 FB of <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act; (3) to amend s 459 A of <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act to allow those who have standing, to apply to the court to wind up phoenix companies; (4) to amend s 601 AH of <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act to allow ASIC to reinstate, through the courts, deregistered companies that have been suspected of conducting phoenix activities; and (5) to introduce s 588 GA of <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act to include both criminal and civil liabilities attached to directors who are found to have conducted phoenix activities...|$|R
