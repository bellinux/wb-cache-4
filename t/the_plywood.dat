5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, <b>the</b> <b>plywood</b> and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>plywood</b> and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the LCP(R)s in {{the first}} wave veered off course to the left, landing between Siki Creek and the rocks of the {{headland}} between Siki Cove and Arndt Point. All the boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 Platoon of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion, which had broken down and was towed by the LCP(R) carrying 10 Platoon, delaying both. Another LCP(R) appeared and took the platoon in. But {{only three of the}} sixteen landed on Scarlet Beach. In some ways this was good, as it meant that <b>the</b> <b>plywood</b> landing craft were not subjected to intense machine gun fire, which might have caused heavy casualties; but there were still serious disadvantages to landing on the wrong beach. On the right, Captain T. C. Sheldon's B Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, accompanied by the anti-tank platoon and 10 Platoon the Papuan Infantry Battalion, landed roughly where they were supposed to, and pushed on to their objective, North Hill.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the experimental research on replacing <b>the</b> actual <b>plywood</b> generally used for longboards manufacturing with plywood made from domestic species of wood, namely beech and birch wood. The research is focused on the determination of bending deformation, modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) for bending strength of <b>the</b> investigated <b>plywood</b> specimens according to SR EN 310 - 1996, and also of the longboards made from the three types of <b>plywood.</b> <b>The</b> research was conducted on standard specimens made from beech and birch plywood on one hand, and on specimens made from a combination of bamboo and Canadian maple <b>plywood,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, having the sizes and testing position according to SR EN 310 - 1996. In addition, boards having sizes and shapes of actual longboards were also tested for bending deformation, using in all cases a constant distance of 500 mm between supports when applying the force, equals to the distance between track rollers of longboard.

25|$|The Mailplane {{had seen}} no {{commercial}} interest, so the design was re-worked as a passenger carrier. This re-designed aircraft was designated the Spartan Cruiser, and the prototype (G-ABTY) first flew in May 1932, piloted by Louis Strange.

25|$|Following {{the opening}} of the hall, there was some {{criticism}} of certain aspects of the acoustics. This was partially attributable to {{the fact that some of}} the original specifications for room surfaces determined by the acoustic consultants were ignored in the building process. A specific problem for performers was the difficulty of hearing each other on the platform.

25|$|In 1936 Yakovlev {{designed}} a long-range sport aircraft, intended to perform record-breaking long-distance flights.

40|$|Plywood is {{normally}} produced with urea-formaldehyde and/or phenol-formaldehyde adhesives. However, {{the former is}} considerably toxic and environmentally damaging, while the latter is expen-sive, thus motivating the search for alternative raw materials in <b>plywood</b> production. <b>The</b> castor oil-based polyurethane adhesive developed at the São Carlos Institute of Chemistry, University of São Paulo, is an environmentally friendly vegetal oil-based polymer that is harmless to humans. The wood species Eucalyptus grandis offers favorable properties for <b>plywood</b> <b>the</b> manufacture. The study reported on here involved the use of castor oil-based polyurethane adhesive to produce plywood with Eucalyptus grandis layers. <b>The</b> <b>plywood’s</b> performance was evaluated {{based on the results}} of physical and mechanical tests recommended by the Brazilian code, ABNT.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the potentiality of muli (Melocanna baccifera) for making bamboo mat plywood. Bamboo mat <b>plywood</b> with <b>the</b> length, {{width and thickness}} of 2. 4 m × 1. 2 m × 7 mm was made using liquid urea formaldehyde resin. The physical and mechanical prop-erties of such plywood were compared with <b>the</b> existing market <b>plywood.</b> <b>The</b> average density of bamboo mat plywood was much higher compared to <b>the</b> existing market <b>plywood.</b> <b>The</b> modulus of rupture (MOR) of bamboo mat plywood was 3 times and the modulus of elas-ticity (MOE) was 6 times higher compared to commercial (Bombax ceiba) <b>plywood.</b> Interestingly, <b>the</b> specific MOR and MOE were signif-icantly {{higher than those of}} market <b>plywood.</b> <b>The</b> high strength values might be due to the long fiber length of the bamboo. Furthermore, the lamination of decorative thin garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus) veneer did not significantly reduce mechanical properties of <b>the</b> prod-ucts. Bamboo <b>plywood</b> mat as well as garjan laminated bamboo mat plywood showed better performance in respect to thickness swelling, linear expansion and water absorption. Hence, muli bamboo can be a potential alternative source of raw material for the manufacture of ply-wood materials...|$|R

25|$|Differences ensued. One of {{the first}} was that Utzon {{believed}} the clients should receive information on {{all aspects of the}} design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for <b>the</b> <b>plywood</b> interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} classes among the New Haven units noting some {{differences}} between the manufacture of each batch. The DER-1a (Diesel-Electric Road) units #0700#0709 had the original design with a mass of vents on the roof, while the DER-1b (#0710#0749) and DER-1c (#0750#0759) had the simplified winterization hatches instead. The New Haven DL-109s could be found hauling passenger trains {{during the day and}} freight trains at night.

25|$|Marine plywood is {{manufactured}} from durable {{face and}} core veneers, with few defects so it performs longer in both humid and wet conditions and resists delaminating and fungal attack. Its construction {{is such that}} it can be used in environments where it is exposed to moisture for long periods.

25|$|Lindbergh also {{insisted that}} {{unnecessary}} weight be eliminated, even {{going so far}} as to cut the top and bottom off of his flight map. He carried no radio in order to save weight and because the radios of the period were unreliable and difficult to use while flying solo. Also, although he was an airmail pilot, he refused to carry souvenir letters on the transatlantic journey, insisting that every spare ounce be devoted to fuel. The fuselage was made of treated fabric over a metal tube frame, while the wings were made of fabric over a wood frame. <b>The</b> <b>plywood</b> material that was used to build most of Lindbergh's plane was made at the Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation in Grand Rapids, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines.
