2500|$|Susan King, a past {{spokesperson}} for [...] San Francisco's Green Party, said about Daly, [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, I totally appreciate {{the fact that he is}} out there in the trenches. It's not 100 percent <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with him, but you know where his heart is and where his values are."

2500|$|Despite {{their many}} {{disagreements}} Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told {{his chief of}} staff and military adviser, Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because [...] "he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes." [...] Brooke responded to Ismay: “Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with him when I don't will be the time to get rid of me, for then I can be no more use to him." [...] When Churchill was told this he murmured, ”Dear Brookie.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not send}} a long letter to your friends, {{telling them what}} you have told me? You can add <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> that the {{photograph}} resembles you closely, and that you wish to talk the matter over once again with this William Dill." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{own opinion}} tallied with Polly's, and I wrote to Percy {{to tell him}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> to remain engaged to him, and that, {{at the end of}} the nine years, if he claimed me, I would be his. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> would not cease all {{correspondence}} with him, although <b>I</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had better do so, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would <b>agree</b> to exchange letters once every three months.|$|R
60|$|They'd make a face, but they'd swallow {{me right}} enough. And when I asked {{them down to}} the best shoot in England they'd come to the {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with them very well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, mine," [...] {{repeated}} Bucklaw; [...] "it {{shall never}} be said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> to back a gentleman {{in a little}} affair of honour, and neither helped him on with it nor off from it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> to his price. I don't {{want the}} trouble of getting food. As he will be going so early, I will come on board at once. I will get my bundle, and {{will be back in}} half an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Anneke, I cannot say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> {{with you}} at all, in this opinion of Mr. Bulstrode," [...] Guert returned, innocently. [...] "It is true, he is English; that he fancies an advantage, as does Corny Littlepage, here; but we must make proper {{allowances}} for home-love and foreign-dislike." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! Perhaps {{that is your}} opinion, but I can't say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you. I don't see why she shouldn't take me. I {{can give}} her a {{position}} which you may call Al out of the Peerage. I can bring her into society. I can make an English lady of her." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Very soon <b>I</b> {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with Mr. Ahmadinejad’s goals but {{not with}} his policies,” Mr. Khoshchehreh said recently. “My first criticism was that you cannot run the country with projects. You have to have plans and policies.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} because we must raise more money <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> {{to the issue of}} the new block of shares," [...] Vane went on. [...] "We ought to pay a fair {{dividend}} on the moderate sum in question." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told the}} captain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with him <b>that</b> the British were the scum of Europe, the westward drift {{of all the}} people, a disgusting rabble, and I lost three pounds by {{attenuated}} retail to Pollack at ha'penny nap and euchre.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} come here to dictate to me the {{provision}} which I am to make for my own child! That is an amount of impudence which I did not expect even from you. But suppose <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> to the terms. Will he, do you think, consent to have a clause put into the settlement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you, Mike. In Ireland, {{we should}} find tens of {{thousands}} of brave hearts ready to join us, but they are unarmed, undrilled, and undisciplined, and would be of comparatively slight assistance to us against the English troops. Defeat would bring down fresh persecutions, fresh confiscations, and greater misery upon the land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Marquis {{has thought}} it better not, and I must say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with the Marquis." [...] At the moment Roden hardly {{knew how to}} go on with the {{business}} in hand. [...] "I believe I am justified in assuring you that anything you would have said to the Marquis you may say to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> to anything of the sort," [...] she declared. [...] "I think {{it was you who}} laid down the law about that. As a matter of fact, <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> your silence about her is very unkind. I suppose you have seen her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, miss, I {{will do as}} {{you tell}} me, but I would say, quite respectful, <b>I</b> hope <b>that</b> you will bear in mind, if things goes wrong, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was dead against it, {{and that it was}} only because you said that it was our only chance of finding Master Walter <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> to lend a hand." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Duff stated, [...] "I am a Christian, but I also don't {{really see}} myself as a {{religious}} person. I {{see myself as}} more of a spiritual person. There {{are a lot of things}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do <b>agree</b> with in Christianity and things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> with. I'm not a regular churchgoer, but <b>I</b> do think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have my own beliefs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel strongly about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Jeff," [...] she wrote, [...] "in {{regard to}} your strictures on war I have [...] only to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you, as I {{have always done}} on all [...] points, heart and soul. Don't forget to keep your feet dry when [...] {{sleeping}} out at nights, and never omit to take the globules." ...|$|E
6000|$|She fronted me, after all, {{still so}} bravely that I {{believed}} her {{for an instant}} not to be, on this article, without an answer she could produce. The unexpected therefore broke for me when she fairly produced none. [...] "I confess I don't make out," [...] she simply said, [...] "while you seem so little pleased <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't {{think the}} little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, {{and the army}} wouldn't be much helped by our giving <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> not to expect {{anything}} from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I've wanted it so long," [...] said Jo, who was a bookworm.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> {{must confess}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with her, though I would have {{preferred}} to postpone it till we heard from your family." [...] He was thoughtfully silent a moment; then he said, [...] "But if their decision is to have no weight with us, I think he ought to be told at once." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{outcome of}} it all was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> to the Mahars' proposition. They promised that Dian would be well treated and {{protected}} from every indignity during my absence. So I set out with a hundred Sagoths {{in search of the}} little valley which I had stumbled upon by accident, and which I might and might not find again.|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> should declare <b>that,</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> {{have never}} previously had any formal {{contact with the}} Trust or its constituent Hospitals, my brother Stuart was a surgeon at two of the Hospitals. He ceased to operate after contracting hepatitis from a patient around 1990 and died of liver disease in 1999. It was partly in honour of his memory <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> {{to take on this}} Review...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you," [...] {{answered}} Sir Robert. [...] "I am {{not sure}} {{that in the long run}} we should not do better for a little more of the article. For my part, although it will not hurt us publicly, for the thing will never be noticed, I am sorry that we have lost Vernon, very sorry indeed. I don't think him a fool, and awkward as they may be, I respect his qualities." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then after a swift {{silence that}} {{took them out}} across St. James's Park, he said: [...] "The people must be taught to obey; they must learn their own ignorance. And I am not sure," [...] he continued, turning his back on Evan and looking out of the prow of the ship into the darkness, [...] "I am not sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with your little maxim about justice. Discipline for the whole society is surely more {{important}} than justice to an individual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 877. The {{identity}} of the force constituting the voltaic current or electrolytic agent, with that which holds the elements of electrolytes together (855.), or in other words with chemical affinity, seemed {{to indicate that the}} electricity of the pile itself was merely a mode of exertion, or exhibition, or existence of true chemical action, or rather of its cause; and I have consequently already said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with those who believe that the supply of electricity is due to chemical powers (857.).|$|E
60|$|I had no notion what I {{was not to}} tell, but our compact demanded <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>agree.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Annie {{felt the}} blood fly to her head, and she {{waited a moment}} to regain her coolness. [...] "I wonder you came to ask me, Mrs. Munger, if you were so sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with you. I'm {{certainly}} Mr. and Mrs. Putney's friend, and so far as admiring Mr. Peck's sincerity and goodness is concerned, I'm his friend. But I'm obliged to say that you're mistaken about the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Grace, [...] "his opinion {{would be}} of great value. It wouldn't be at all {{essential}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>agree</b> with him:' ...|$|R
60|$|Dear Lady Violet,--I am {{not sure}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you in your admiration of Rochefoucauld--of the Reflexions, ou Sentences et Maximes Morales, I mean. At least, I hardly agree when I have read many of them at a stretch. It is not fair to read them in that way, of course, for {{there are more than}} five hundred pensees, and so much esprit becomes fatiguing. I doubt if people study them much. Five or six of them have become known even to writers in the newspapers, and we all copy them from each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would gladly}} pursue this discourse, Andries, {{and bring it}} to a happy termination," [...] I answered; [...] "but here come the squatters in a body, and I suppose some {{movement}} or proposal is in the wind. We will defer our matter, then; you remembering <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> to none of your opinions or decisions. Dus is to be mine, if indeed we can protect her against the grasp of these wretches. I have something to say on that subject, too; {{but this is not the}} moment to utter it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have said, sir, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> wholly neither with Mr. Barnstable nor Captain Manual," [...] {{continued}} the lieutenant, {{after a short}} pause. [...] "The command of this party is mine, as the senior officer, and I must beg leave to claim it. I certainly {{do not think the}} preparation that Captain Manual advises necessary; neither would I undertake the duty with as little caution as Mr. Barnstable proposes. If there are soldiers to be encountered, we should have soldiers to oppose them; but as it must be sudden boat-work, and regular evolutions must give place to a seaman's bustle, a sea-officer should command. Is my request granted, Captain Munson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Byron {{is really}} so unhappy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>agreed,</b> much against my [...] inclination, {{to let him}} remain in this County till after the next [...] Holydays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I regret <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>agree</b> with you. <b>I</b> devoutly wish I could," [...] said Geoffrey, uneasily. [...] "No! {{you must}} please go no further, Miss Savine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In <b>that</b> case <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> most heartily," [...] James Adams said, [...] "and it will gladden my father's {{heart to}} be told that the work is now to go on really in earnest." ...|$|R
