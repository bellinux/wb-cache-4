5|$|Adult Potamon fluviatile {{may reach}} a {{carapace}} length of , with females being generally smaller than males. As with other crabs, {{the body is}} roughly square, with the reduced abdomen tucked beneath the <b>thorax.</b> The <b>thorax</b> bears five pairs of legs, {{the first of which}} is armed with large claws.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated <b>thorax</b> temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its <b>thorax</b> to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the <b>thorax.</b> Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thorax</b> is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the <b>thorax</b> {{is that part}} from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the <b>thorax.</b> When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the <b>thorax</b> is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|As in all insects, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} sections: the head, <b>thorax,</b> and abdomen. The <b>thorax</b> is {{composed}} of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the head}} and <b>thorax</b> is the {{membranous}} neck or cervix. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between {{the head and}} the <b>thorax</b> is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified {{with a pair of}} tympanal organs.|$|E
5|$|During the pupal stage, the {{morphology}} of {{the adult}} is developed through elaboration from larval structures. The general aspect {{of the adult}} is visible before the outer surface hardens – the head, resting on the <b>thorax,</b> the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the <b>thorax</b> and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal <b>thorax</b> displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange <b>thorax</b> and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the <b>thorax</b> and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the <b>thorax.</b> The <b>thorax</b> is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
5|$|Henschoutedenia epilamproides has a stridulatory organ {{between its}} <b>thorax</b> and abdomen, but {{the purpose of}} the sound {{produced}} is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a <b>thorax</b> and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The <b>thorax</b> has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the <b>thorax</b> {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{an adult}} {{butterfly}} or moth (imago) has three distinct divisions, called tagmata, connected at constrictions; these tagmata are the head, <b>thorax</b> and abdomen. Adult lepidopterans have four wings: a forewing and a hindwing on {{both the left and}} the right side of the <b>thorax</b> and, like all insects, have three pairs of legs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thorax,</b> which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the <b>thorax.</b> The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E
5|$|Book I The {{grouping}} {{of animals and}} {{the parts of the}} human body. Aristotle describes the parts that the human body is made of, such as the skull, brain, face, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, <b>thorax,</b> belly, heart, viscera, genitalia, and limbs.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have the}} overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a head, neck, trunk (which {{includes}} the <b>thorax</b> and abdomen), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most crabs, the abdomen is folded under the <b>thorax</b> and shows clear sexual dimorphism: in males it is {{comparatively}} narrow, {{whereas in the}} female it is wider.|$|E
5|$|Scales also {{cover the}} head, {{parts of the}} <b>thorax</b> and abdomen as well as parts of the genitalia. The {{morphology}} of scales has been studied by Downey & Allyn (1975) and scales have been classified into three groups, namely hair-like, or piliform, blade-like, or lamellar and other variable forms.|$|E
5|$|The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) {{abundant}} throughout some {{certain parts}} of the body, including the funiculi and tarsi. It is more sparse on the coxae, genae (an area {{on both sides of the}} head below the eyes), gaster and gula (the reduced sternite of the first segment of the <b>thorax).</b> Hairs on the scapes point downwards. Erect and suberect hair are seen all over the body in sparse numbers, although this varies. These hairs are not as abundant in comparison to other Novomessor species. The head and <b>thorax</b> are both -colored, and the epinotal spines, legs and node are yellowish red. The antennal scapes are reddish brown and the abdomen is piceous brown. The hair exhibits a gold-like color. The suture is absent from the <b>thorax,</b> and the mesonotum is wider than the epinotum. The front portion of the mesonotum is narrow whereas the back is rectangular. The node is evenly round and oval shaped, the postpetiole is narrow at the front and the dorsum is feebly convex. The gaster is large and oval shaped.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} {{crustacean}} {{is composed}} of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the <b>thorax,</b> and the pleon or abdomen. The head and <b>thorax</b> may be {{fused together to form}} a cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow. The shell around each somite can be divided into a dorsal tergum, ventral sternum and a lateral pleuron. Various parts of the exoskeleton may be fused together.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of thyroid ima artery is also observed in other higher primates. The artery {{has been reported}} in gorillas, gibbons, macaques and gray langurs. Variations in the origin were also seen; it was found to originate from the aorta in the <b>thorax,</b> or the carotid in the neck.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thorax</b> and abdomen are {{segmented}} {{and have}} a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines {{and there are a}} pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the <b>thorax</b> houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thorax</b> of the {{butterfly}} {{is devoted to}} locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the <b>thorax</b> bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper and}} lower parts of the <b>thorax</b> (terga and sterna respectively) are {{composed}} of segmental and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera. The prothorax is the simplest and smallest of the three segments while the mesothorax is the most developed.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite <b>thorax</b> {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's <b>thorax,</b> temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a <b>thorax</b> and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The <b>thorax</b> has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Isopoda is {{an order}} of {{crustaceans}} that includes woodlice and their relatives. Isopods live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of antennae, seven pairs of jointed limbs on the <b>thorax,</b> and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen {{that are used in}} respiration. Females brood their young in a pouch under their <b>thorax.</b> Isopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are grazers, or filter feeders, a few are predators, and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fishes. Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water, but some more derived taxa can swim for a short distance. Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defence mechanism or to conserve moisture.|$|E
5|$|M. nigriceps {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other. For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black or dark brown; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers. The <b>thorax</b> and pedicel are noticeably darker and brownish red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and <b>thorax.</b>|$|E
5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the <b>thorax,</b> causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{adults are}} oblong-ovate, {{and the same}} size and build as P. hyoscyami, but not as broad, {{measuring}} between 2.8 and 3.6mm in length. They have a brassy-green head and <b>thorax,</b> shining reddish-brown elytra and brassy-green legs. The hind femora are brassy in colour but paler at the base, and the antennae are brick-red. The adults are fully winged, and are capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation. Scales on the <b>thorax</b> {{and other parts}} of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and <b>thorax</b> of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which could {{have played a role}} in respiration as it does in birds.|$|E
5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the <b>thorax</b> and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The caterpillar-like larvae have hard sclerotinised {{heads with}} mandibles (jaws), short true legs on the <b>thorax,</b> prolegs {{on the first}} eight {{abdominal}} segments, and a suction disc or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The <b>thorax</b> is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and <b>thorax,</b> M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the <b>thorax</b> from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the <b>thorax.</b> Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the <b>thorax,</b> adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
