40|$|AbstractWithin {{the context}} of {{e-participation}} and involvement provided by social media tools, public organizations should provide a dialogic approach to their relationship with <b>their</b> <b>publics.</b> Having more touchstones with <b>their</b> <b>publics</b> and less control over <b>their</b> message, <b>public</b> organizations should improve their strategies of communicating with citizens. Through a content analysis of three Romanian public organizations’ activity on Facebook, this study will examine how this social networking site is used to inform, connect, involve, mobilize and interact with Romanian citizens. The results highlighted that mobilizing, informing and interacting were the most used strategies and that Romanian citizens’ involvement implied mere actions of liking, sharing and commenting the visual and verbal posts...|$|R

The web 2. 0 is generating {{significant changes in the}} manner that organizations engage in dialogue with <b>their</b> <b>publics,</b> opening the way towards the interactive communication. In this way, web 2. 0 tools will foster the dialogic communication between museums and <b>their</b> <b>publics.</b> Through them, the relationship between museums and publics is changing towards more interactive and collaborative forms. The objective {{of this article is to}} assess the level of dialogic communication developed by museums on the Internet, by analyzing the use of web platforms and social web applications as tools for dialogic communication by 120 museums in Spain. Two key aspects of communication between museums and publics using the Internet were identified to that end: content management and interaction management. These aspects enable a matrix which makes a distinction between the phases of evolution of the institutional web communication. The results obtained show that the museums studied are predominantly in a phase of monologic communication with <b>their</b> <b>publics...</b>|$|R

The study highlights that library managers must consider these websites and make them able to performance its several functions since they represent the library in the web.

The communication process through websites must occur in a two way direction, from libraries to <b>their</b> <b>publics</b> and from <b>their</b> <b>publics</b> to the libraries. The results of studies undertaken based on the classification of library websites functions are presented in order to verify the communication function performance.

40|$|The Internet {{has changed}} {{the way in which}} {{organizations}} communicate with <b>their</b> <b>publics,</b> and museums are not an exception. The consolidation of Web 2. 0 has not only given museums access to a powerful new tool for disseminating information, but has involved significant changes in the relationship between institutions and <b>their</b> <b>publics,</b> facilitating and enhancing the interaction between them. The overall objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the degree of interactivity implemented in the websites of major international art museums, in order to assess if museums are evolving towards more dialogic systems with relation to <b>their</b> <b>publics.</b> The results indicate that museums still have a low level of interactivity on their websites, both in the tools used to present information and the resources available for interaction with virtual visitors. But it has also observed that museums are progressively implementing interactive and dialogic sources, suggesting a clear trend towards new ways of managing these platforms in order to establish more participatory and collaborative communication systems with virtual users.
