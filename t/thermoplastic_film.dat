The microfilter was manufactured by soft-lithography and replica molding and then combined with plasma activation and chemical treatment using 3 -(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES). To demonstrate the functionality of the PDMS microfilters, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles (MPS) were filtered through the microfluidic device based on the three <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>films.</b> Subsequently, the mixing capabilities of a passive PDMS micromixer was observed with the injection of polymeric MPS (fluorescent and nonfluorescent) as fluidic mixers are not generally effective at mixing particles. On mixing nonfluorescent MPS (approximate to< 10 - 30 mu m in diameter) a mixing performance of 13. 3 % at 5 mm was observed. Therefore, a PDMS microfiltering device was integrated with a PDMS micromixer using a simple and cost effective home-made polymeric connector for filtration at a size sorting of 11 mu m.

Using six different layup configurations the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>film</b> rings have been shown to suppress delamination crack growth at the desired interfaces. This resulted in manipulation of the damage footprint areas. Configurations that reduced delamination area by up to 38 % demonstrated an improved CAI strength of up to 18 % relative to a baseline panel. However, two configurations which saw an increase in delamination area by up to 30 % showed similar CAI strengths to the baseline panel. This finding would confirm that it is the delamination interface location that influences the CAI strength not the damage footprint area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} few years, a growing {{interest}} on covalent bonding of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices to <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>films</b> has developed due to reduced costs, biocompatibility, and flexibility. The silane reagent, 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) {{has been applied to}} create this bonding. Here, we report on the fabrication of replica PDMS micromixer devices from a silicon mold using soft lithography that is rapid, facile, and cost-effective to manufacture. After replica molding, the PDMS micromixer devices were bonded to the APTES-activated <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>films</b> of polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyethylene naphthalate. Characterization of these thermoplastic surfaces was analyzed by contact angle measurement, surface free energy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. To demonstrate the functionality of this technology, we have analyzed the PDMS micromixers by a peel test, nonleakages, and mixing with the injection of inks, a surfactant, and varying pH solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first reported example in literature of the PDMSAPTESthermoplastic films preparation that integrates a complex micromixer device. Here, we have established that the hydrophobicity of both sealed polymers required alteration in order for dispersion of a polar liquid in the mixing loops. The application of a polar solvent before injection can remedy this ill effect formulating a hydrophilic micromixer. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the fabrication technology, bonding technique, and application of the micromixer that, once optimized, can eventually integrate more components to formulate a lab-on-a-chip with the fabrication of gold microelectrodes for biological analysis of blood or plasma...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of damage in a fibre reinforced polymer composite is, {{in the absence}} of plastic deformation, an inevitable feature of the various mechanisms by which energy is absorbed. To develop a damage tolerant composite material it is essential to understand and characterise the expected damage morphologies and subsequently design to mitigate their manifestation. Methods to achieve this have typically been attempted via optimised laminate stacking sequences or development of increasingly stronger and tougher constituents. However, an alternative approach towards damage tolerance could be to manipulate and control the formation and location of damage patterns using techniques that are generic in their application and non-detrimental to the global properties of the composite. The overarching aim of this research project was to identify a technique and demonstrate its ability to suppress interlaminar crack growth in a composite laminate under compressive loading. Initial literature review on the subject of interlaminar crack arrest determined six different techniques as potential candidates for the purpose of suppression and manipulation of delamination propagation within a composite material. These methods where subsequently explored experimentally which helped highlight discrete interleaved materials as the most promising technique. Further investigation of interleaving materials aided in characterisation of various interleaved material types with <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>films</b> exhibiting the most desirable properties. Discretely spaced <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>films</b> were then implemented in a composite panel and successfully shown to suppress delaminations induced through low velocity impact tests. Simulations studies confirmed that influence of delaniination interface location on the compressive strength of composite dominates over the overall damage footprint area. Further experimental tests successfully demonstrated the control of delamination damage propagation in a panel under cyclic compressive loading using discrete interleaved films. Although current practice for composites design in safety critical applications is to employ a 'no growth' damage tolerance design philosophy, the hypothesis {{of this study was to}} promote a re-evaluation of this mind set.
