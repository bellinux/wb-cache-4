5|$|In 1943, the Norwegian Troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied), No. 12, and No. 14 (Arctic) Commandos {{assisted}} the Royal Navy {{in carrying out}} anti–shipping raids in Norwegian coastal waters. The Commandos provided extra firepower for the navy Motor Torpedo Boats when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> sea and acted as a guard force when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> anchor in the Norwegian fjords. In April 1943, seven men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando {{took part in a}} raid on German shipping near Haugesund code named Operation Checkmate. They managed to sink several ships using limpet mines, but were captured and eventually taken to Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where they were executed.|$|E

5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|At first Nansen and Johansen {{made good}} {{progress}} south, but on 13 April suffered a serious setback when {{both of their}} chronometers stopped. Without knowing the correct time, {{it was impossible for}} them to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches on the basis of Nansen's guess that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E

Only the race order and number of laps completed was taken into account for the new race, time differences between the cars were voided. The distance of the new race was the number of laps remaining from the original races, less three laps.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven {{observe a}} vision of the Children of the Forest {{creating}} the Night King by impaling a man with a dragonglass dagger. Bran subsequently confronts Leaf, one of the Children, about creating the White Walkers. She explains that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> war with the First Men, and had no choice. Bran decides to observe a vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in the vision. Bran awakens to find a mark where he was touched, and the Three-Eyed Raven warns that he must leave, as the Night King is now able to find them.|$|E

5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a safety {{review of the}} Apollo program. In response to this review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule {{to make room for}} the three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost any point whilst <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon. The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.|$|E

In addition, his time at Michigan defined an era {{in a way that}} became a permanent reference because his contemporaries would say that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> Michigan in the Chappuis years. In 1988, he was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{a team of}} archeologists {{found three}} mummies of {{children}} {{on the top of}} Llullaillaco. At the time of their death they were six, seven, and fifteen years old. They were ostensibly human sacrifices offered to the gods of the Inka pantheon on mountaintops. In 2003 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the Catholic University of Salta, but starting from 2007 they {{can be found at the}} Museum of High Altitude Archaeology of Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of embryonic ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E

5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying large sums of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
5|$|The chefs were {{initially}} {{surprised at how}} busy <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> lunchtimes; Harveys had been based next to Wandsworth Common and so the typically slow lunch service was used to give the chefs a break. Now based near Hyde Park, they had {{four or five times}} the number of covers for a lunch service than before. White remained determined to gain his third Michelin star, and to achieve this, he sought to emulate and surpass the food and service at Pierre Koffman's three Michelin star restaurant La Tante Claire. White worked 14/15 hour days for six days a week, expecting similar hours from those chefs under him, with the restaurant only closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} headquarters {{also provided}} training assistance {{in preparation for}} small-scale National Guard operations, Joint Readiness Training Center rotations, leadership training for National Guard commanders, and annual summer training for the three brigades. As {{a part of this}} commitment, the 7th Infantry Division headquarters would deploy a command element to serve as higher headquarters for large-scale training and field exercises, evaluating and coordinating the units as they trained. It would also conduct quarterly status checks with the three brigades to discuss readiness and resource issues affecting those units, ensuring that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> peak performance should they be needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the BK Broiler {{was one of the}} most successful product launches in the restaurant industry at the time, encouraging the company look into introducing additional products that would match the success of the Broiler. Furthermore, the success of the product was credited by analysts from Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities as one of the main factors helping Burger King realize a 47% increase in profit margin over the same period in 1989. By 1992, sales of the BK Broiler had slowed to half of what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> the height of its introduction.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its {{period at}} Ubon, No.79 Squadron formed {{part of an}} {{international}} force tasked with defending Thailand's air space against intruders. At {{the start of the}} deployment, tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron's personnel believed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> war. While the situation became more stable from late July 1962, No.79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times and scrambled Sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected. No air attacks were conducted against Thailand, however, and the unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the Central Intelligence Agency-controlled Air America. In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew North Vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
