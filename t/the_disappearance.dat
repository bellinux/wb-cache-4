5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A {{in the days leading}} up to <b>the</b> <b>disappearance</b> and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before <b>the</b> <b>disappearance,</b> during which burglars had entered through windows.|$|E

The project was suggested to be linked to <b>the</b> <b>disappearances.</b> <b>The</b> publishing house had also already gone to press with a book entitled 2017: Upheaval in China, but it was withdrawn by the author before publication.|$|R

5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This {{may be caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>disappearance</b> of a helium convection zone near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Using mobile-phone {{tracking}} techniques, {{police were}} able to trace who had used cell phones near the scene of <b>the</b> <b>disappearance</b> within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries. The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club {{around the time of}} the disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to <b>the</b> <b>disappearance.</b>|$|E

50|$|As more {{significant}} notice of <b>the</b> <b>disappearances</b> was taken, several organised searches were launched {{to find the}} culprits. One search took note of the telltale cave but the men refused to believe anything human could live in it. Frustrated and in a frenetic quest for justice, the townspeople lynched several innocents, and <b>the</b> <b>disappearances</b> continued. Suspicion often fell on local innkeepers since they were the last known to see many of the missing people alive.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>disappearance</b> of Olubei {{from the}} scene ca. 1458, no princes are known by name until Isaac in 1465, {{possibly}} Olubei's son. Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign was brief, as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. Alexander {{and his family were}} taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was beheaded, his son was forcibly converted to Islam, and his wife and daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E

50|$|Many victims’ {{groups have}} {{continued}} {{to call for a}} thorough and independent investigation into <b>the</b> <b>disappearances</b> of <b>the</b> conflict, and a commission was formed through the Commission on Investigation into Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Act 2014 (CoID-TR Act). The CoID-TR Act established two separate commissions: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a Commission of Inquiry on <b>the</b> <b>Disappearances</b> (CoID). <b>The</b> two commissions were able to share their information and coordinate their operations.|$|R

5|$|Another {{earthquake}} hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, {{described the}} city as partly in ruins.

5|$|Both Allied and Japanese {{naval forces}} {{continued}} to converge on 22 August {{and both sides}} conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, however neither side spotted its adversary. <b>The</b> <b>disappearance</b> {{of at least one}} of their scouting aircraft (shot down by aircraft from Enterprise before it could send a radio report), caused the Japanese to strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S., however, was unaware of the disposition and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to <b>the</b> <b>disappearance</b> of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, <b>the</b> <b>disappearance</b> of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
