The NCO site provided tools and discussions on how to use them, how to find what they needed, and how to digest it all.

Dedicated and passionate volunteers gave their personal time and resources to develop, grow, and make the NCO site relevant. Each NCO had a full-time day job. It was a team effort with many unsung heroes. On August 28, 2003, Cmd Sgt Maj. Dan Elder was awarded the first-ever AKM Pioneer Award by the US Army Chief Information Officer.|$|E

40|$|Bukh, the maximalist, {{as some of}} {{his friends}} called  him. Then a more {{appropriate}} word was found – perfectionist. He aimed at perfection in everything he did. Be it  town planning, municipal administration, work for a  non-governmental organization Union of Architects  of Russia, or creating a journal. The headwater area has always been and remains  the best residential area ever built in recent history  of Irkutsk. Irkutsk has never seen such a clever and honest  chief architect. He has done so much to develop the  city in the right and progressive direction and to  promote high quality architecture. Andrei Bokov’s words can be related to Vladimir  Bukh’s activity: “Everything that excites a fair and  natural envy, the best examples of the second heroic  epoch of the Russian-Soviet architecture, belong  to Irkutsk architecture of the 1970 s: orientation  towards the future (but not the past), bigness of  volumes and ideas, restraint, strictness, honesty,  courage, persistency and strength. Irkutsk experience… was accumulated by young  people, who were energetic, ambitious, lucky, captivating,  talented and highly professional. ” For several decades Bukh {{was a member of the}} Board  of the Irkutsk organization of the Union of  Architects of the USSR and then of Russia. The  expression “to work with feeling” can be fully  applied to Bukh. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> the right way. To do  it according to your conscience. When he quitted  the Board after demolition of the House on the  Legs, it became clear that he was indispensable.   He took to heart all town planning mistakes of the  1990 s and 2000 s. Pavlov’s death, demolition of the  House on the Legs, legal proceedings, Nina’s death  left scars on his heart. His daughter Lesya, grandchildren Nikita and  Nastya, and great grandson Matvey are continuation  of his life. All we, his colleagues and friends, can do  is try to keep to his understanding of what is right  and what is wrong. And to keep memory of a wonderful  man. I do not know how long Project Baikal will exist  (Bukh is one of the founders, the first and the best  editor-in-chief), but all our further issues will be  dedicated to him. As well as our defeats, since he  did not hesitate to attempt tasks that were doomed  to be defeated in the current system, in the current  Order of Things in the town planning policy. In the book PAVLOV (together with Bukh, we had  managed to compose it last summer, and in the  beginning of September it came out in TATLIN publishing  house in Yekaterinburg) there is a reference  to the Strugatsky brothers that can be also applied  to Bukh: “Like Saul, he fired at the Order of Things,  knowing that it was useless”. </p...|$|E
