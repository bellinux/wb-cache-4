5|$|In 1999, Christian and Edge parted {{ways with}} Gangrel, who {{associated}} himself with The Hardy Boyz (Jeff and Matt Hardy) to form The New Brood; as a result, they began feuding with The Hardy Boyz, {{and went on}} to compete in a ladder match at the No Mercy PPV event on October 17, 1999, for the managerial services of Terri Runnels and $100,000, which The Hardy Boyz won. At Survivor Series, Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz faced Too Cool and The Hollys in a Four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match where they lost. At Armageddon, Edge and Christian competed in a 8-team battle royal which was won by The Acolytes. At Royal Rumble, Christian competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Rikishi. At No Way Out, Edge and Christian defeated The Hardy Boyz in a tag team match to determine the number one contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship. On April 2, 2000, at WrestleMania 2000, Christian and Edge defeated The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat Ladder match, which ultimately {{led to the creation of}} the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC). At Backlash, Christian and Edge defeated D-Generation X to retain titles. At Judgment Day, Edge and Christian and Kurt Angle lost a Six-man tag team match to Rikishi and Too Cool. They lost the tag titles <b>to</b> <b>Too</b> Cool soon after, but won them back in a four corners elimination match at King of the Ring. At Fully Loaded they defended the titles against The Acolytes Protection Agency (Faarooq and Bradshaw) where they got disqualified but retained the titles.|$|E
5|$|With Kilmer's casting, Warner Bros. dropped Rene Russo as Chase Meridian. Robin Wright, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton {{were all}} being {{considered}} the role was recast with Nicole Kidman. Billy Dee Williams {{took on the}} role of Harvey Dent in Batman on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, after having worked with him on The Client. Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so after his son's insistence. Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast. Robin appeared in the shooting script of Batman Returns but was deleted due <b>to</b> <b>too</b> many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. Chris O'Donnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.|$|E

25|$|There are differing {{views on}} how many schools a student should apply to. Several reports suggest that {{applying}} <b>to</b> <b>too</b> many schools caused unnecessary stress and expense, and hampers a student from targeting applications to a few select schools. But other advisors suggest that applying to more schools increases overall chances for acceptance. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest applying to eight to ten schools is best, and that applying <b>to</b> <b>too</b> many schools is counterproductive. There are reports that {{the average number of}} schools that students are applying to has been increasing, perhaps because of greater use of the Common Application. In 2008, applications to Harvard University had increased to a record number at 27,278, a 19% increase from the year before. One effect of these numerous applications is to lower the average yield of colleges, which dropped from 46% to 38% in 2001 according to one account.|$|E

25|$|After a 10-year hiatus, Coppola {{returned}} to directing with Youth Without Youth in 2007, {{based on the}} novella {{of the same name}} by Romanian author Mircea Eliade. The film was poorly reviewed, currently holding a 30% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was made for about $19 million and was given a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films {{in order to avoid the}} marketing input that goes into most films that results in trying to make films appeal <b>to</b> <b>too</b> wide an audience.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} bomber, {{known as}} the 2MB2, or Experimental Washi-type Light Bomber (Washi - Eagle), was completed in December 1925. While it demonstrated good performance, and was rated as superior to the proposals from Kawasaki (a {{modified version of the}} Dornier Do C) and Nakajima (the Breguet 19) by the Army evaluators, it was considered <b>to</b> <b>too</b> expensive to build owing to its complex structure, and was also rejected. The Japanese Army instead adopted a modified version of Mitsubishi's Navy Type 13 Carrier Attack Aircraft as the Army Type 87 Light Bomber (company designation 2MB1), despite a poorer performance and bombload.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 2006, Air New Zealand and Qantas {{announced}} that they had signed a code-share agreement for their trans-Tasman routes and would file for authorisation from the New Zealand Ministry of Transport and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The airlines maintained that they were making losses on Tasman routes due <b>to</b> <b>too</b> many empty seats, and that a codeshare would return the routes to profitability. Critics, particularly Wellington International Airport, Christchurch Airport and Melbourne Airport, argued that the codeshare would lead to reduced passenger choice and higher airfares, and that cities such as Auckland and Sydney would benefit immensely through economic activity services would bring.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the crash}} was {{originally}} blamed on pilot error, it was subsequently {{found to have}} been caused by slush {{towards the end of the}} runway, causing deceleration of the aircraft and preventing safe flying speed. During take-off, the aircraft had reached , but, on entering the slush, dropped <b>to</b> , <b>too</b> slow to leave the ground, with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with tail-wheel undercarriages had not been greatly affected by slush, due to the geometry of these undercarriages in relation to the aircraft's centre of gravity, but newer types, such as the Ambassador, with nose wheel landing-gear and the main wheels behind the centre of gravity, were found to be vulnerable. The accident resulted in the imposition of operating limits for the amount of slush build-up permitted on runways.|$|E
25|$|The Champions Trophy was {{the brainchild}} of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was ICC {{president}} in the late 1990s. It had a dual aim of spreading the game to emerging nations and raising money for the ICC in between World Cups, thus enabling it to pump more cash into those fledgling cricket countries. The first tournament, labelled as a mini World Cup, was staged in Dhaka in October 1998 and raised more than £10 million. The second, in Nairobi, was a commercial success although the crowds stayed away. By the time the 2002 event was held – and there was disquiet as it was so close to the World Cup five months later – the idea of playing in developing nations had been ditched and as revenue-generation was the main raison d'etre, it needed to be in one of the main countries as this allowed the format to be expanded. In 2004 the jamboree moved to England and it became clear the format of group games led <b>to</b> <b>too</b> many meaningless games. By the time the 2006 tournament in India came into view, the event was under fire from some quarters, and at one time there were even hints that India might decline to take part in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} no sources are given {{for a number of}} the {{regulations}} in the first part points to an early date of composition (comp. i. 3, 13; ii. 4, 6, 8; iii. 4, 6-9a, 10-12a; iv. 4, 5, 8, 9; v. 1, 2; in i. 7, also, Müller cites no authority; comp., however, Shab. 115a and Meg. 18a, and see Blau, l.c. pp. 70 et seq.). Similarly, in the third part (x.-xxi.), which is later, no sources are assigned for a number of halakot (xv. 3 may, however, be based on Yer. Shab. 15c, 25); so that care must be taken not to assign the compilation of this longest portion <b>to</b> <b>too</b> recent a date. Both the form and the content of those passages in which authorities are not mentioned point to a Judean origin; they may have been derived from the lost portions of Yerushalmi and various midrashic works, which, indeed, they may be regarded as in part replacing. Only certain interpolations, as well as the haggadic passage {{at the end of the}} treatise (or, in several manuscripts, at its beginning), may have been added much later. The division of the last part into sections ("peraḳim") seems to have been intended to secure a uniform size for the several sections; for xvi. 1 belongs to the end of xv., and xix. 1 to the end of xviii., their separation being due to external reasons.|$|E
