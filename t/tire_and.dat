By {{the end of}} its first year the road earned $3million in revenue from 5million motorists, {{exceeding}} the $2.67million needed for operation and bond payments. With the onset of World War II, revenue declined due to <b>tire</b> <b>and</b> gas rationing; after the war, traffic again increased.|$|E

5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because <b>tire</b> <b>and</b> wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and {{it was found that}} under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All Prius models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E

Planning for finished <b>tires,</b> green <b>tires</b> <b>and</b> for components is included as the model is developed. A multi-item production planning program is presented for finished <b>tires</b> <b>and</b> this is expanded to an assembly model with precedences for green <b>tires</b> <b>and</b> for components. ...|$|R
5000|$|Event 6 - Eliminator: Diane led Janet {{seventeen}} points {{giving her}} an {{eight and a}} half seconds headstart. Diane had some difficulty on the climbing rope but still led Janet until she <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> slipped on the travelator giving Janet the advantage but she <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> slipped as well but Diane <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> slipped again while Janet almost made it up with hassle but <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> grabbed on to the platform and rope swing through the paper and into the quarter finals while Diane tripped but with some encouragement from referee John Anderson, Diane eventually made it up the travelator on the fourth attempt and rope swing through the paper. Phil led David by nine points giving him a four and a half seconds headstart. Phil led throughout until he reached the travelator where he <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> grabbed on to the podium but was brought down giving David a chance. When both ran, David tripped while Phil again <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> grabbed on to the platform, but this time, he managed to pull himself up and rope swing through the paper and into the quarter finals.

Notable defense contractors include Goodyear <b>Tire</b> <b>and</b> Rubber Company in Akron, Lockheed Martin in Akron, which won a contract to develop a space-ship in 2003 and produces the vertical launch ASROC missile, and Armor Holdings Aerospace and Defense Group in Fairfield. United Kingdom-based BAE Systems has a large facility in West Chester producing armored vehicles, armor kits, and ballistic glass.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, WOR's {{official}} city of license {{was changed}} to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard III; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to Worcester, in central Massachusetts, to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved {{the sale of the}} Yankee Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares—to the Ohio-based General <b>Tire</b> <b>and</b> Rubber Company.|$|E

5|$|Maverick {{industrialist}} Howard Hughes {{took over}} RKO in 1948. After years of turmoil and decline under his control, Hughes sold the troubled studio to General <b>Tire</b> <b>and</b> Rubber Company in 1955. The original RKO Pictures ceased production in 1957 and was effectively dissolved two years later. In 1981, broadcaster RKO General, the corporate heir, revived it as a production subsidiary, RKO Pictures Inc. In 1989, this business with its few remaining assets, the trademarks and remake rights to many classic RKO films, {{was sold to}} new owners, who now operate the small independent company RKO Pictures LLC.|$|E

Early {{in the first}} round, McGee {{was hit with a}} stiff shot that dropped him and later {{suffered}} a minor cut below his eye. In the second round, Jensen began to visibly <b>tire</b> <b>and</b> after being hit, began to bleed from the nose. McGee won the second round after a takedown just before the bell. In the third round, McGee successfully executed a takedown and a full mount, where he secured an arm triangle choke to force the tapout at 1:21 of the final round.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November Major J.G. Rees of the 25th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers {{had only}} 60 men to hold Beit Ur el Foqa when the post was almost surrounded. They managed {{to break out}} of the {{position}} and joined the support company of the 10th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry covering Et <b>Tire</b> <b>and</b> facing Signal Hill, which became the focus of the next Ottoman attack. This came at 14:30 when they attacked with 400 soldiers, driving the detachment from Signal Hill. This move made Et Tire untenable and forced the 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry to fall back to its original line.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the <b>tire</b> <b>and</b> the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone <b>Tire</b> <b>and</b> Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and had turned to a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making things more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front <b>tire</b> <b>and</b> a faulty rear shock absorber in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E

5|$|In the Ramayana, Tara is {{addressed}} by Vali as {{the daughter of}} the vanara physician Sushena. Sometimes, verses are added in the Bala Kanda, the first book of the Ramayana, which describe principal monkeys created by various deities: Vali and Sugriva are described as sons of the king of the gods, Indra and the sun-god Surya respectively; while Tara is described {{as the daughter of}} Brihaspati, the guru of the gods. The 12th century Tamil Ramavataram and the Telugu Ranganatha Ramayanam state that Tara and Ruma rose, along with other apsaras, from the ocean of milk during its churning by the gods and the demons, to acquire the elixir of life (amrita). In the Theyyam drama tradition of Kerala, the gods <b>tire</b> <b>and</b> request Vali to help in the churning. When Vali just starts churning, Tara rises from the ocean and thus is gifted to Vali.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's <b>tire</b> <b>and</b> the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he was off the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|E
