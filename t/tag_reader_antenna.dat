40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) is {{an automatic}} identification technology employing radio waves for detecting objects [1, 2]. Nowadays, RFID {{is widely used}} in many areas including asset tracking and real-time supply chain management. RFID relies on storing and retrieving information. The radiated wave energizes the IC chip to allow proper communication of data transfer between the RFID reader and the <b>tag.</b> <b>Reader</b> <b>antenna</b> is required to be low in profile yet provides wideband and high directivity characteristics in transmitting and receiving signal for data communication. In general, there are four frequency bands: low-frequency (LF) band (125 kHz), high-frequency (HF) band (13. 56 MHz), ultra high-frequency (UHF) band (869, 915, and 950 MHz) and microwave band (2. 45 and 5. 8 GHz) [3]. The UHF and microwave bands are widely used due to their advantages of long read range and high data rate, it is desirable to design a single antenna which operates on both frequency bands...|$|E
40|$|Historically, lake {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser fulvescens) were abundant in Lake Michigan with free and unobstructed {{access to the}} feeding and spawning areas within its many tributaries. Construction and operation of hydroelectric dams has impeded this access. One method for re-establishing this lost connection {{is to create an}} artificial pathway such as a fish passage facility. To help answer some basic questions, such as will sturgeon use a fishway, we constructed a prototype fish passage structure below a hydroelectric dam on the Menominee River in northern Wisconsin. This hydroelectric facility is located near Amberg, Wisconsin and owned by We Energies. The structure was designed with a ramp to a 1. 07 meters per second (mps). The structure was equipped with a Passive Integrated Transponder tag (PIT <b>tag)</b> <b>reader</b> <b>antenna</b> and underwater video cameras equipped with infrared lights. All monitoring equipment were installed and activated {{before the start of the}} 2009 spring spawning season 9 mid-April) and removed following the 2010 autumn migration (mid-October). PIT tag records indicated that 86 tagged lake surgeon used the passage structure in 2009 and 112 in 2010, with many sturgeon going through the structure multiple times. Video data verified these results and also indicated that these sturgeon moved through the structure rather quickly (mean = 3 sec in camera view). Extrapolated to the whole sturgeon population, nearly 20...|$|E
30|$|Each {{manufacturer}} of sensing equipment (e.g. RFID <b>tags,</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>antenna,</b> etc.) gives {{a range of}} specifications. For example, a reader angle may say “ 65 ° plus or minus a degree.” Although the range may not seem large, it still may lead to false results if improperly calculated. Therefore, it is proper to test the specifications of each newly acquired piece of equipment to verify it is {{in accordance with the}} manufacture’s specification. Each unit varies slightly, and it is important to use what has been verified from the testing to produce proper results in the final system. This section provides the experiments and results used in this research.|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{numerical analysis}} of the power transfer efficiency (PTE) for the forward link of near-field (NF) ultra high frequency (UHF) -radio frequency identification (RFID) systems is addressed in this paper, by resorting to an impedance matrix approach where the matrix entries are determined through full-wave simulations. The paper is aimed to quantify the NF-coupling effects on the PTE, {{as a function of}} the distance between the <b>reader</b> and <b>tag</b> <b>antennas.</b> To allow for a PTE comparison between different <b>reader</b> and <b>tag</b> <b>antenna</b> pairs, a benchmarking tag-loading condition has been assumed, where the tag antenna is loaded with the impedance that maximizes the PTE. In a more realistic loading condition, the load impedance is assumed as equal to the conjugate of the tag antenna input impedance. Full-wave simulations use accurate antenna models of commercial UHF-RFID passive <b>tags</b> and <b>reader</b> <b>antennas.</b> Finally, a “shape-matched antenna” configuration has been selected, where the <b>reader</b> <b>antenna</b> is assumed as identical to the tag antenna. It is shown that the above configuration could be a valuable compact solution, at least for those systems where the relative orientation/position between the <b>tag</b> and <b>reader</b> <b>antennas</b> can be controlled, and their separation is of the order of a few centimeters or less...|$|R

A framework of IoT and its RFID components for the proposed reusable tag are presented.

30|$|Thus, Eqs. (20) and (22) also {{addressed}} issues like variation in <b>tag</b> and <b>reader</b> <b>antenna</b> sensitivity with direction; reflection of signals off floor, ceilings and walls that will produce both constructive and destructive interference; variation in read sensitivity between different models; variation in tag performance with aging; variation in range due to body shadowing; since {{each one of}} these issues will produce, in the light of Cid and MCid techniques, the same effect: variations on the RFID tags ranges. In other words, variations from the spherical range surface model to a generic range surface model.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} phenomena, the {{following}} {{conclusions can be}} drawn: if the required data rate is not high, {{it is better to}} use real-symbol constellation for the transmitted symbols at the tag and correspondingly to use Scheme II decoding policy at the reader receiver; by keeping the cost of the system under constraint, it is better to deploy multiple <b>tag</b> <b>antennas</b> and <b>reader</b> <b>antennas,</b> and the number of <b>reader</b> <b>antennas</b> should be at least equal to the number of tag antennas.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental characterization of wireless systems, specifically RFID technologies, applied to polishing/cutting process {{control in the}} marble industry. The application of RFID systems has the final aim of allowing the automatic and contact-less detection {{of the presence of}} a marble slab in different points of a marble machine, outside and/or inside, trying to overcome some limitations of the currently used proximity detectors. Slab detection is needed for the process control in order to properly activate the abrasive or cutting heads of the machine. Four RFID systems at 125 kHz, 13. 56 MHz, 868 MHz and 2. 45 GHz have been tested in different set-ups representative of those found in marble machines.

40|$|The {{discrimination}} of tagged items {{moving along}} {{a conveyor belt}} from other tagged items that {{are present in the}} scenario is investigated, when a UHF-RFID gate is installed at a conveyor section. Indeed, tagged items that are static or randomly moving in the scenario (nomad <b>tags)</b> around the <b>reader</b> <b>antenna</b> could be detected even if they are not on the conveyor (false positive readings). The classification procedure here proposed exploits the SARFID phase-based technique used to localize tags on a conveyor belt, which takes advantage {{of the fact that the}} tagged items move along a conveyor, whose path and instantaneous speed are both known. The latter can be implemented with only a firmware upgrade, in any conveyor belt scenario already equipped with an RFID system, without any modification of the system infrastructure and additional (reference tags/multiple antennas) or ad hoc hardware. From experimental results in a real scenario, the discrimination between moving tags from static/nomad tags can be obtained with an overall accuracy greater than 99. 9 %, by employing only one <b>reader</b> <b>antenna...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{of things}} (IoT) refers to uniquely {{identifiable}} objects and their virtual representations in an Internet-like structure {{to be managed}} and inventoried by computers. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) - a prerequisite for the IoT - is an automatic way for data transaction in object identification and is used to improve automation, inventory control and checkout operations. An RFID system consists of a reader device and one or several <b>tags.</b> Smart <b>reader</b> systems are building blocks for cutting edge applications of RFID and as a subdivision of these systems, RFID smart shelf solutions are started to be implemented for large-scale item-level management where characteristics of <b>reader</b> <b>antennas</b> are critical issue. This work focuses on designing optimised <b>reader</b> <b>antennas</b> for high frequency (HF) RFID smart shelf systems which operate based on inductive coupling between the <b>tag</b> and the <b>reader</b> <b>antennas</b> and have good performance in crowded environments. Firstly, an approach is presented to increase band-width of HF RFID <b>reader</b> <b>antennas</b> to improve the reception of sub-carrier frequencies. A fabricated enhanced band-width antenna at 13. 56 MHz is evaluated for its capability in being used for smart shelf applications. The obtained band-width supports sub-carrier frequencies for all the HF RFID standards to be detected easier and thus leads to increased identification range. It is shown the HF RFID technology is capable of identifying the distance of tagged books based on the received magnetic field intensity. Secondly, multi turn small self resonant coil (MT SSRC) antennas are introduced and analysed as {{a new model of}} inductively coupled <b>reader</b> <b>antennas.</b> Based on the analysis, two turn planar SSRC (TTP SSRC) antennas having similar dimension with the current HF RFID <b>reader</b> <b>antennas</b> are investigated. Fabricated TTP SSRC antenna operating at 13. 56 MHz is resulted to optimised Q factor and more uniform near field pattern in comparison with the similar antennas. Also, a number of TTP SSRC antennas operating at a distinct frequency, 13. 56 MHz, are fabricated on different substrates and it is shown the desired Q factor and antenna dimension can be obtained based on the dielectric characteristics of the substrate...|$|R
40|$|Radio Frequency Identification {{is going}} to play a very {{important}} role as auto-identification solution for many application scenarios, where item-level tagging and high performance are crucial. In such a context, the use of passive Ultra High Frequency (UHF) tags is strongly suggested but, unfortunately, general-purpose commercial tags could not meet all the requirements in presence of critical operating conditions, including the presence of metals and liquids, the misalignment between <b>tag</b> and <b>reader</b> <b>antennas,</b> and the need of multiple reading of tags. In this paper, the main features that a UHF tag should own to work properly in the whole supply chain are presented. A tag, named below Enhanced tag, satisfying all the individuated requirements has been also realized and validated in a controlled test environment simulating the pharmaceutical supply chain. Tests have been focused on the above-mentioned critical conditions. The performance of the Enhanced tag, in terms of successful read rate, has been compared with that of some commercial Far Field and Near Field UHF tags. The experimental results are impressive and clearly demonstrate that ad hoc Far Field UHF tags are able to effectively solve many of the performance degradation problems affecting generalpurpose tags. Finally, the proposed tag has been also tested in extreme conditions, applying it directly on Tetra Pak packages containing liquid, with interesting results in terms of platformtolerant features...|$|R

40|$|Addressing and {{geolocation}} for indoor environments {{are important}} fields {{of research in}} the recent years. The problem of finding location of objects in indoor spaces is proposed to solve in two ways.

In this paper the second approach is discussed by using Radio Frequency Identification technology to identify and track high value objects in jewellery retail industry. In Ubiquitous Sensor Networks, the reactivity or proactivity of the environment are important issues. Reactive environments wait for a request to response to it. Instead, in proactive spaces, the environment acts in advance to deal with an expected action.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{systems have}} emerged as an {{affordable}} solution for object identification. They are a cheap and error proof alternative to traditional object identification techniques such as bar codes and visual recognition. The problem is to identify objects attached with passive tags. If there are multiple objects {{within the range of}} the <b>tag</b> <b>reader,</b> then all objects send their identification to the <b>tag</b> <b>reader</b> {{at the same time in}} response to the <b>tag</b> <b>reader’s</b> query. This causes collisions at the <b>tag</b> <b>reader</b> and no <b>tag</b> is identified, leading to retransmission of tag IDs which results in wastage of bandwidth and an increase in the total delay in identifying all the objects. Hence protocols need to be devised between the tags and the <b>tag</b> <b>reader</b> to avoid or minimize collisions. Typical collision resolution protocols for a generic multi-access communication system cannot be directly applied to our problem due to constraints on the design of the tag such as lack of battery, low memory, minimum computation power, etc. The main focus of this paper is to discuss collision resolution protocols between the tag and the <b>tag</b> <b>reader.</b> We have surveyed four protocols for the above problem and discussed their merits and demerits. We also explain the applicability of each of the protocols to a scenario where objects need to be identified and updated in an inventory management system. 1...|$|R

Results are shown. 1. Background RFID tags show great promise for the supply chain, but even newer generations show sharp variations in performance [7]. To implement the technology reliably, its performance must be predictable. Work has been undertaken to test tag performance directly [7], and also to test products with attached tags. One approach to testing tagged products is to simulate a supply chain and send the products through it [3], comparing different tags in different positions on the item to find an optimal location. This technique is effective but time-consuming. In this paper we describe a system developed to automate this process. Automation brings advantages of both speed and accuracy, as well as great flexibility in configuration changes to the testing environment. 2.
