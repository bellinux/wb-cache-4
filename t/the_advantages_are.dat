25|$|Electronic {{components}} that require clear transparency for light to exit or enter (photovoltaic panels and sensors) can be potted using acrylic resins that are cured using UV energy. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> low VOC emissions and rapid curing.|$|E
25|$|Multiple anchor mooring systems use {{two or more}} (often three) {{light weight}} temporary-style anchors set in an {{equilateral}} arrangement and all chained to a common center from which a conventional rode extends to a mooring buoy. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> minimized mass, ease of deployment, high holding-power-to-weight ratio, and availability of temporary-style anchors.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> <b>was</b> a 4 MHz Z80a-based {{computer}} with 64 KB of user RAM and 16 KB of graphics RAM. It used two single-sided, double-density 180 KB floppy disk (hard-sectored) drives and an optional 5 MB Winchester disk. <b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{known for its}} 640×240 graphics capabilities and was sold with four demonstration programs, one of which plotted and calculated a pattern of lines reminiscent of the Arcade game Qix. <b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> also had an optional 8088 co-processor board available that ran MS-DOS 1.0. When <b>the</b> <b>Advantage</b> <b>was</b> introduced NorthStar had moved its offices, manufacturing and warehousing facilities to 14440 Catalina St. in San Leandro, California. NorthStar remained at that location until they ceased operations.|$|R

25|$|Even {{though the}} number of vessels was in parity, the total of guns favored the rebel navy. With 91 cannons, 430 sailors and 234 troops {{in front of the}} 36 cannons (2 in a land battery) and 442 men of <b>the</b> royalists, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{supposedly}} on <b>the</b> revolutionary side. Nonetheless, as a third of the force was concentrated on the lead ship Hércules, so <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> tied to its performance and luck.|$|R
25|$|Despite all the {{favorable}} factors, and utilization in commercial reactors in the past, interest in thorium diminished {{in the late}} 1980s due to various reasons. Critics of thorium claim that <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> overstated and {{it is unlikely to}} be a useful source of energy. Experts point the adverse economics and the availability of plentiful sources of energy that will deter full commercialization of thorium based energy. These and other issues regarding the use of thorium have been debated.|$|E
25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> pretty much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|Dead weights are the {{simplest}} type of anchor. They are generally {{made as a}} large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> that they are simple and cheap. A dead weight mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages are that they are heavy, bulky, and awkward.|$|E

25|$|Teleconferencing and {{telepresence}} {{technologies are}} often implemented in green computing initiatives. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins {{as a result of}} lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc. The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed. Other related initiatives, such as Hoteling, reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it. Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.|$|E
25|$|Israel ranks tenth in {{the world}} for the number of patent {{applications}} filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by country of residence of the first-named inventor. Israeli inventors file far more applications with USPTO (5 436 in 2011) than with the European Patent Office (EPO). Moreover, the number of Israeli filings with EPO dropped from 1400 to 1063 between 2006 and 2011. This preference for USPTO is largely because foreign research centres implanted in Israel are primarily owned by US firms such as IBM, Intel, Sandisk, Microsoft, Applied Materials, Qualcomm, Motorola, Google or Hewlett–Packard. The inventions of these companies are attributed to Israel as the inventor of the patent but not as the owner (applicant or assignee). The loss of intellectual property into the hands of multinationals occurs mainly through the recruitment of the best Israeli talent by the local research centres of multinational firms. Although the Israeli economy benefits from the activity of the multinationals’ subsidiaries through job creation and other means, <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> relatively small compared to the potential economic gains that might have been achieved, had this intellectual property been utilized to support and foster the expansion of mature Israeli companies of a considerable size.|$|E

2500|$|The {{costs are}} falling due to newer and cheaper technologies, and <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> {{becoming}} more compelling as offshore work enters ever deeper {{water and the}} environment (coral) is given more respect.

There was, of course, a price to pay for this." [...] The HD cameras were approximately four times heavier than the cameras which are usually used for filming of this type. They are also more than 20 times more expensive, costing up to £100,000 each.|$|E

I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a concentration camp! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on.

6000|$|Looking {{round at}} these poor prisoners, therefore, {{it struck me}} as an immense absurdity that they should fancy us their enemies; since, whether we intend it so or no, they have a far greater stake on our success than we can {{possibly}} have. For ourselves, the balance of advantages between defeat and triumph may admit of question. For them, all truly valuable things are dependent on our complete success; for thence would come the regeneration of a people,--the removal of a foul scurf that has overgrown their life, and keeps then in a state of disease and decrepitude, one of the chief symptoms of which is, that, the more they suffer and are debased, the more they imagine themselves strong and beautiful. No human effort, on a grand scale, has ever yet resulted according to the purpose, of its projectors. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> always incidental. Man's accidents are God's purposes.
