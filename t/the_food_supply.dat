5|$|The FBI arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks {{them into}} taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had {{previously}} cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's {{not one of the}} Africans, but it fails. While praying to God in Addis Ababa, Cartman says he is sorry he made fun of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Miss Struthers's hoarding of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> to the Ethiopians, who then take control of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{in camps}} varied {{considerably}} geographically and over time. Conditions were particularly {{poor in the}} summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate the large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front turned against Germany, conditions worsened and <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E

5|$|Continued {{problems}} with <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> coupled the unpopularity {{of some of}} the government's measures, led to widespread press criticism of the Pierlot government. Strikes across the country in February 1945 further destabilised the government. On 7 February 1945, Pierlot publicly defended the actions of the government in parliament, but failed to make a significant impression. The government fell in February, and was replaced by a new, short-lived national union government under Achille Van Acker while the polemic surrounding the possible dismissal or restatement of Leopold III were considered.|$|E
5|$|The {{worst of}} Linda's impact was in Vietnam, where 3,111 people were killed, and damage totaled $385 million (USD). Heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding, which {{damaged or destroyed}} about 200,000 houses and left about 383,000 people homeless. Widespread crop and transportation damage also occurred, the latter which impeded relief efforts. Several {{countries around the world}} sent relief aid, including medical teams, food, and clothing. However, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. Linda later struck Thailand, causing flash flooding and at least 164 deaths. The storm also affected Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia to a lesser degree.|$|E

5|$|Before {{striking}} Japan, Higos produced {{strong winds}} in the Northern Marianas Islands while passing to their north. These winds damaged <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> on two islands. Later, Higos moved across Japan with wind gusts {{as strong as}} 161km/h (100mph), including record gusts at several locations. A total of 608,130buildings in the country were left without power, and two people were electrocuted in the storm's aftermath. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 346mm (13.6in). The rains flooded houses {{across the country and}} caused mudslides. High waves washed 25boats ashore and killed one person along the coast. Damage in the country totaled $2.14billion (¥261billion 2002JPY), and there were five deaths in the country. Later, the remnants of Higos affected the Russian Far East, killing seven people involved in two shipwrecks offshore Primorsky Krai.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits mangroves and its absence from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. <b>The</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> already deficient in 1917, though starvation had been avoided in southern Finland. According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War would solve all past problems, but instead the power struggle led to starvation in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> of {{the country}} {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E

5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} the economy and <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} identified basic {{supplies that}} it needed {{in response to the}} storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment. The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction. Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs ($360,000 USD) for immediate relief assistance. Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan. Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities, due to the poor state of the roads. After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.|$|E
