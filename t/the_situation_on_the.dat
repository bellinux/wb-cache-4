5|$|The Mura {{sector was}} quiet on 9 April. The 42nd Infantry Division Murska took the 39th Infantry Regiment under command, but the 105th Infantry Regiment and 341st Reserve Regiment began to {{disintegrate}} due to desertions. Due to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right {{flank of the}} 42nd Infantry Division Murska, 4th Army headquarters ordered it and Detachment Ormozki {{to withdraw from the}} Drava to behind the Bednja to conform to the line being held by the 27th Infantry Division Savska on its immediate right flank.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{returned to}} Australia via Bombay, where the infantrymen {{were transferred to}} the troopship City of Paris in early February. They arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, on 24 March 1942. After this a period of leave followed, and then the battalion undertook defensive duties and training around Yandina, Queensland, before being dispatched {{along with the rest}} of the 7th Division to New Guinea where <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kokoda Track was becoming critical for the Australians as the Japanese advanced towards Port Moresby.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts {{had little to do with}} <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E

5|$|Drusus {{had little}} time to mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of his}} grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rhine.

5|$|In 1993, Croatia {{launched}} several small-scale {{military operations}} against the RSK to seize significant local objectives and capture international attention; it was worried <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground might become permanent. In response, the RSK military retrieved their weapons from the UN/RSK-controlled storage sites, reversing {{the only major}} success of UNPROFOR. In March 1995, the UNPROFOR mission was terminated following the efforts of U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke; the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation was deployed to Croatia with a new mandate. Later that year, most of the territory controlled by the RSK was captured by the HV during Operations Flash and Storm, which was foreseen by Babić when he opposed the Vance plan in 1991. The rest of the RSK-held areas were regained by Croatia following the Erdut Agreement negotiated between Croatian and Serbian authorities on 12 November 1995 during peace talks that also produced the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border.

At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E

His proposal was to make a government body that would rule on behalf of FerdinandVII, together with Viceroy of Peru José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, Governor of Potosí Francisco de Paula Sanz and President of the Royal Audiencia of Charcas Vicente Nieto.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Muslim {{left wing}} which Yazid {{commanded}} was considerably more serious. Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed {{assistance from the}} mobile guard, the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps {{and for a moment}} Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken, though their morale was severely damaged.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{front was}} chaotic {{during the day}} September 1. The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the Kihang ferry, {{captured}} Agok, and scattered A Company, 9th Infantry at its positions from Agok northward. A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river. From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers {{on many of the}} ridges surrounding them, most of them moving east. After several hours, 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to Agok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night, returning later with much needed water, rations, and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bloody}} setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took {{six weeks to}} {{carefully}} plan another crossing of the Danube. He launched this operation late on 4 July and, by {{the early hours of}} the next day, he had managed to get a substantial force across the river. Nansouty's division did not see any action during the first day of the Battle at Wagram and at night they camped behind the Imperial Guard. The next day, 6 July, Nansouty was at first directed to support Davout, on the French right, but when it became clear that the latter's sector was not threatened by the arrival of enemy reinforcements, they were ordered back into reserve in a central position on the battlefield, not far from the village of Aderklaa. Then, as <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French left rapidly deteriorated, they were called into action, when Napoleon ordered Marshal Bessières, commander of the Cavalry Reserve, to launch his men in a charge against the Austrians menacing his left. With time at the essence, Bessières opted not to wait for the Guard cavalry and, with his other two heavy cavalry divisions assigned to other sectors of the battlefield, he decided to lead forward only Nansouty's men. This division was indeed very strong: 24 squadrons, more than 4,000 men, including Brigadier General Defrance's 1st and 2nd carabiniers-à-cheval, Brigadier General Doumerc's 2nd and 9th cuirassiers and Brigadier General Berckheim's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy {{casualties}} {{during the}} initial attack, the Germans were able to land reinforcements and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island quickly deteriorated for the Allies. The brigade had abandoned its initial positions {{and moved to a}} new location to the west of Galatas to eliminate the threat that it would become separated from the 5th Infantry Brigade. On 25 May, the 18th Battalion had to deal with a full-scale attack by Fallschirmjäger. This caused heavy casualties and a large portion of one of the battalion's companies was captured. Despite reinforcements arriving from the 20th Battalion and the best efforts of Gray in rounding up stragglers, the Galatas position was breached and the township captured. Some battalion personnel, led by Gray, along with the bulk of the 23rd Battalion, participated in an attack that briefly re-took the township but it later had to be abandoned again after further fighting. The battalion was then withdrawn to the east as the order to evacuate Crete was received, making its way towards Suda Bay, where Allied ships were taking troops off the beaches. Along the way, they were subjected to heavy air raids, one of which killed a company commander, Captain Jack Lyon, the Member of Parliament for the Waitemata electorate.|$|E

5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E

5|$|The split and, due to {{the open}} letter's allegations, Turunen's {{character}} {{became the subject of}} close media coverage. Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some interviews in which she explained her view. She was upset that after nine years of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the distribution of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E

5|$|Though {{hampered}} {{by the need to}} work inside his own end zone, Marcus Vick completed an 11-yard pass to tight end Jeff King for a first down. The play was the sole positive gain for the VT offense, however, and Virginia Tech was forced into its sixth punt of the game. The kick was a poor one, and traveled only 28yards before flying out of bounds. Thanks to the bad kick, Weatherford was able to start his offense inside Virginia Tech territory, and took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first play after the punt, Weatherford completed a 41-yard throw downfield to Willie Reid, who hauled in the ball at the Virginia Tech three-yard line to give the Seminoles a first and goal. After a failed quarterback sneak, however, Florida State was penalized 10yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for a loss of threeyards on the next play. Although unable to cross the goal line for a touchdown, FSU did send in kicker Gary Cismesia for his second field goal attempt of the day. The kick, a 41-yarder, was good and gave Florida State a 203 lead with 4:23 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|When Roquebert's ships {{appeared}} off Grand Port, Hillyar had {{his three}} {{ships in the}} harbour ready to sail at short notice and ensured that French tricolours were flying from Île de la Passe and other landmarks {{in the hope that}} the French could be lured into the shallow waters of the bay and defeated in a similar manner to the British defeat at the battle at Grand Port the previous year. Signals were exchanged between the French squadron and the shore but Roquebert was wary: the signals from Île de la Passe were out of date and he knew of the British invasion from the Lisbon newspapers captured two months before. Waiting offshore, the French commodore sent three boats ashore during the night with instructions to discover <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. Seizing two black inhabitants, one of the boats returned on the morning of 7 May and from his captives Roquebert learned that the British had captured the island six months earlier. The other landing parties were captured by British troops and did not return. With Hillyar's trap uncovered, Roquebert raised French colours and turned eastwards away from Grand Port, Hillyar emerging from the harbour to give chase.|$|E
