40|$|Four granite {{intrusions}} and coeval small enderbite intrusions, {{belonging to}} the lateorogenic (1850 – 1820 Ma) magmatism of the Svecofennian orogeny, are described in the Veikkola area of southern Finland. <b>The</b> <b>granites</b> are leucocratic, heterogeneous and characterizedby abundant garnet. <b>The</b> oldest <b>granite</b> is layered whereas the younger ones are more homogeneous. Geochemically <b>the</b> <b>granites</b> are peraluminous and have high contents of SiO 2 (71 – 76 wt. %). Their major and minor element composition varies significantly but the REE patterns are fairly similar. Garnet mainly crystallized from melt but some garnet in <b>the</b> <b>granites</b> may be restitic. Garnet composition is relatively constant implying slow equilibration with the melt. In addition to garnet-bearing felsic layers in <b>the</b> oldest <b>granite,</b> <b>the</b> <b>granites</b> are crosscut by garnet-bearing dikes and veins. The layers, dikes and veins are higher in REE and Fe/Mg than <b>the</b> host <b>granites</b> and are considered partial melts from <b>the</b> <b>granites.</b> <b>The</b> abundant garnet in the felsic layers, dikes and veins crystallized from melt. Thermobarometry calculations indicate 3. 5 – 5 kbar and ~ 650 – 700 °C estimates for crystallization of the felsic layers in <b>the</b> oldest <b>granite</b> whereas <b>the</b> host <b>granite</b> yields ~ 1. 5 kbar higher pressure. <b>The</b> <b>granites</b> were probably derived by dehydration melting of layered, metagreywacke-dominated rocks. Melting was fluid-absent both during generation of <b>the</b> <b>granites</b> and during formation of the felsic layers, dikes and veins. <b>The</b> oldest <b>granite</b> (1850 Ma) was emplaced at mid-crustal depth before extensional deformation. Layering in <b>the</b> oldest <b>granite</b> {{is regarded as the}} result of deformation-induced remelting of <b>the</b> host <b>granite</b> at a higher crustal level, during protracted extension and progressive regional metamorphism. <b>The</b> otherthree <b>granites</b> and <b>the</b> enderbite were emplaced at a late stage of extension, at or close to the peak of metamorphism (1. 83 – 1. 82 Ga) ...|$|R

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today.

40|$|The Sor Rondane Mountains mainly {{consist of}} Proterozoic {{metamorphic}} rocks and {{various kinds of}} Late Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic granitic rocks.

5000|$|Geologically the Bohus is a monzogranite, a subtype of <b>granite.</b> Besides <b>the</b> main {{minerals}} plagioclase, K-feldspar and quartz <b>the</b> Bohus <b>granites</b> contain lesser {{amounts of}} magnetite, apatite, zircon, titanite, garnet and monazite.

40|$|The geochemical {{composition}} of some garnet-bearing biotite <b>granite</b> pebbles within <b>the</b> Menaver Conglomerate were investigated, {{together with the}} U–Pb isotope systematics of zircons extracted from two samples. <b>The</b> <b>granites</b> have suffered low-grade metamorphism {{as shown by the}} development of a secondary mineral assemblage of chlorite, Fe-oxides, muscovite and stilpnomelane.

40|$|SUMMARY. <b>The</b> <b>granites</b> of Sardinia {{have been}} {{analysed}} for copper, lead, and zinc, and each element {{has been found}} to show a regional variation. There is a close relationship between the copper and lead contents of <b>the</b> <b>granites</b> and <b>the</b> distribution of copper and lead mineralization i the island, but very little relation between the zinc contents of <b>the</b> <b>granites</b> and <b>the</b> distribution of zinc mineraliza-tion. This is attributed to a greater degree of lithophile character of zinc in the magmatic source region. THERE are many indications that the earth's crust is not uniform in respect of its content of certain elements. Differences in the distribution of mineralization have given rise to the concept of metalliferous provinces, such as the tin-rich province of Cornwall, the copper-rich province of Arizona, or the lead-zinc-rich province of south-west Sardinia. If, as many authors believe, granitic magmas originate in the crust, differences in crustal trace-element abundances should be reflected in <b>the</b> compositions of <b>granites.</b> With this in mind, an investigation has been made of the distribution of copper, lead, and zinc in <b>the</b> <b>granites</b> of Sardinia...|$|R
