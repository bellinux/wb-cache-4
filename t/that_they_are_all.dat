5|$|Back in the car, Jack {{begins to}} lose {{confidence}} in his problem-solving abilities because Liz still wants to break up with Carol. As they talk through Liz's past problems with sex, they realize <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> connected to the incident with the Tom Jones poster and that each time she has had a problem, it is because she has been reminded of the singer. Liz is relieved that she has found the root of her problem and Jack convinces her to stay with Carol. When they finally reach Newark Airport, Liz realizes that she is supposed {{to meet him at}} John F. Kennedy International Airport instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{investigates the}} MUFON group, {{discovering}} several women {{who claim to}} recognize her from her abduction experience. They have similar implants to Scully's, and inform her <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> dying of cancer. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the Newport News shipyard and searches the Talapus. Armed men arrive and scour the ship, but Mulder manages to escape. That night, he discovers a warehouse where a craft is being fumigated by a hazmat team. Mulder believes the craft to be of alien origin, recovered by the Talapus.|$|E

5|$|The Pleiades {{have long}} been {{known to be a}} {{physically}} related group of stars rather than any chance alignment. The Reverend John Michell calculated in 1767 that the probability of a chance alignment of so many bright stars was only 1 in 500,000, and so surmised that the Pleiades and many other clusters of stars must be physically related. When studies were first made of the stars' proper motions, it was found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> moving in the same direction across the sky, at the same rate, further demonstrating that they were related.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E

25|$|Freedman's main theorem about Casson handles states <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> homeomorphic to D2R2; or {{in other}} words they are topological 2-handles. In general they are not {{diffeomorphic}} to D2R2 as follows from Donaldson's theorem, and there are an uncountable infinite number of different diffeomorphism types of Casson handles. However {{the interior of a}} Casson handle is diffeomorphic to R4; Casson handles differ from standard 2 handles only in the way the boundary is attached to the interior.|$|E
25|$|In a {{lightning}} protection system, {{a lightning}} rod is a single component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to perform its protective function. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum. Copper and its alloys {{are the most common}} materials used in lightning protection.|$|E

25|$|Separated twin pairs, {{identical}} or fraternal, {{are generally}} separated by adoption. This makes their families of origin non-representative of typical twin families {{in that they}} adopt their children away. The families they are adopted to are also non-representative of typical twin families in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> approved for adoption by children's protection authorities and that a disproportionally large fraction of them have no biological children. Those who volunteer to studies are not even representative of separated twins in general since not all separated twins agree {{to be part of}} twin studies.|$|E
25|$|The Premier League {{was founded}} in 1992 after England's top clubs {{broke away from the}} Football League in a {{successful}} effort aimed at increasing their income at the expense of clubs in the lower divisions. Links with The Football League were maintained, and each season the bottom three clubs are relegated from the Premier League and replaced by the top three from the Championship. The Premier League is contested between 20 clubs each season. Each club in the Premier League in any given season owns one twentieth of a share in the league itself, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> supposedly equal owners with equal rights and responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} Resnais's films among English-language commentators {{has been that}} they are emotionally cold; <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> about technique without grasp of character or subject, that his understanding of beauty is compromised {{by a lack of}} sensuousness, and that his seriousness of intent fails to communicate itself to audiences. Elsewhere however it is suggested that such views are partly based on a misreading of the films, especially his earlier ones, which has impeded an appreciation of the humour and irony which pervade his work; and other viewers have been able to make the connection between the film's form and its human dimension.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Bugle finds Peter's suit {{thrown in}} the trash and runs a {{headline}} about Spider-Man disappearing. Arachne reads this and becomes enraged ("Think Again"). She devises a plan to bring Spider-Man back by having all of his former enemies descend on the city at once. The Geek Chorus interrupts, citing the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> dead. Arachne's furies then take over the script-writing and scare the Chorus away. Peter and MJ enjoy a night out dancing, now that Peter has no real commitments to Spider Man and is back in school doing well. Suddenly, the power goes out; then {{the walls of the}} club come alive with the image of the Green Goblin, apparently alive and wreaking havoc. The villains destroy the city piece by piece, yet still Spider-Man does not appear ("Sinistereo").|$|E
25|$|After {{having his}} way with Aoi, Yuuko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all 3 captured, Kimura reveals his plans to make them his sex slaves. Yuuko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He {{considers}} this and tells Yuuko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yuuko gives him a very long blowjob while her two daughters watch. When Kimura seems pleased at her performance, Yuuko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. Instead, Kimura reveals that he will never change his mind and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> there to stay. Yuuko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The game ends with the ominous title card that as a new day starts the Kiryu family horror has 'only just begun'.|$|E
