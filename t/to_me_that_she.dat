500|$|The New York Times quoted Wheeler Parker, {{a cousin}} of Till's, who said, [...] "I was hoping that one day she [...] would admit it, so it matters <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did, and it gives me some satisfaction. It's {{important}} to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, {{and a lot of}} black people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivier and Esmond {{married on}} 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, {{although}} within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded {{that the marriage}} was [...] "a pretty crass mistake. I insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings.... She had admitted <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish". Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be [...] "mere coincidence", unconnected to the nuptials.|$|E
500|$|In 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist. She was {{eighteen}} months younger than Yeats and later claimed {{she met the}} poet as a [...] "paint-stained art student." [...] Gonne admired [...] "The Island of Statues" [...] and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, {{and she had a}} significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, [...] "it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> [...] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes." [...] Yeats's love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but {{sometimes}} it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> {{a different kind of}} friend with the Story Girl than she is with me and you," [...] reflected Cecily. [...] "I can't just explain what I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then that}} transcendent girl will confess <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> when <b>she</b> threw {{overboard}} her prince <b>she</b> remembered <b>that</b> I adored her!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>she</b> {{was afraid}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> too {{would be taken}} captive and eaten, but I kept my reflection to myself.|$|R
500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, she said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would like to know what a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTA. She confessed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had had {{letters from}} him.|$|E
60|$|Miss Haldin was shocked, but {{admitted}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{not altogether}} surprised.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it is a great, great {{pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will give back the little property to my sister's child. You will have your mother's, {{and thus it}} will all come together again." ...|$|R
6000|$|My heart beat. Did Betty suspect? Was {{that last}} {{sentence}} meant <b>to</b> inform <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was aware of}} my secret folly, and laughed at it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Merciful to my mother! Mrs. Orme, {{speak out}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> If the will was forged, who forged it? You cannot mean <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did it!" ...|$|R
60|$|THE BISHOP. Mrs Collins has {{something}} to say <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wants you to hear.|$|E
60|$|Later in {{the evening}} So-ta confided <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was soon to leave the tribe.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{every man}} to his taste. It did not {{certainly}} appear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>SHE</b> was the martyr of the family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sister," [...] Mr. Pengarth said, [...] "Juliet {{has come}} today <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> on business. In effect, {{she has come}} <b>to</b> remind <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is grown up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say so, Ermine! One {{reason why}} she is so {{intolerable}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is a grotesque caricature of what you used to be." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she would}} pat {{me on the}} arm and smooth my dress, as much as <b>to</b> assure <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a good opinion of me, the {{distance}} between us notwithstanding.|$|R
60|$|I drew {{a little}} nearer to her. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very pale, {{and there was}} trouble in her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope Mrs. Mannering {{does not}} object to my coming," [...] she said. [...] "It {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not particularly cordial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [*--On re-reading {{this history}} {{it comes back}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> [...] {{was the mother of}} M'tonga, who was much younger than [...] Umbelazi. --A. Q.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did she {{leave me}} no word or token, Augusta? <b>She</b> swore <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> died she would send <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{the other half}} of that {{necklace}} which I wear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, you met her,' I said; 'I'm positive. I {{introduced}} you to her myself, and <b>she</b> confided <b>to</b> <b>me</b> afterwards <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{thought you}} a most charming man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, papa. <b>She</b> told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Frederic Aylmer was to {{have all}} her property. <b>She</b> {{explained}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> everything <b>that</b> <b>she</b> meant <b>to</b> do, and I thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was right." ...|$|R
60|$|Yet {{it seemed}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> exaggerated her raptures {{for some reason}} or other. With her it was very {{difficult}} to distinguish between craft and innocence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I am {{somewhat}} {{proud of}} her. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> prefers mind to matter, {{which is a}} great deal to say for a young lady." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last one}} of the ladies took so much fancy <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would have me home to her house, for a month, she said, to be among her daughters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course. And {{no doubt}} it is very gratifying <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thinks so much of religion. It {{should be the first}} {{consideration}} with all of us at all times. But she has never been used to men like Mr. Saul." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> mutely signed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it was; <b>she</b> {{had become}} deadly pale.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That couldn't {{have been}} Lady Merrifield,' persevered Miss Hacket. 'She lamented <b>to</b> <b>me</b> herself <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had been out}} of England for so many years <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had {{scarcely}} seen Mrs. Maurice Mohun.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At last! at last!" [...] {{she murmured}} to herself, as though forgetful of my presence. Then {{her eyes closed}} and her lips moved softly. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was praying.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} it." [...] Gordon smiled. [...] "As it happened, I saw Miss Waynefleet {{crossing}} the clearing. It occurs <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may {{have said something}} that set you thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After this I don't {{know how}} I'm to trust her. I don't indeed. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{has been so}} artful throughout. It has been a regular case of catching." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Queen, in her gracious answer, informs <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> meant <b>to</b> have {{mentioned}} Mr. Poole <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had wished to place {{him in the}} Charter House, but found the society there was not such as he could associate with.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sorry}} she's married--but--it seems strange <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should go from me. It even seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> hard <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can prefer {{to go with}} her Leonard. That's how mothers are--I know it's silly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what had}} she been doing all the time?" [...] I queried. [...] "Do you mean <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> a married woman, had been content to let her husband {{disappear}} without making any attempt to trace him?" ...|$|R
