It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.|$|E

5|$|Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency is a 2003 book by W. Thomas Smith, Jr. It is an encyclopedic {{work on the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), {{the only}} {{independent}} agency of the United States federal government that is tasked with intelligence-gathering. The work chronicles {{the history of the}} agency from its founding in 1947 through the War on Terror, which began after September 11, 2001. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in 2003. It provides approximately 550 entries across 282 pages on topics including notable contributors, intelligence operations, historical events, and depictions of <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> fictional media.|$|E
5|$|The drone attacks {{carried out}} by <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross the border into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base {{were involved in the}} coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E
5|$|Tung also {{headed a}} group run by <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> <b>in</b> which ARVN {{personnel}} of northern origin infiltrated North Vietnam, posing as locals. The {{objective was to}} gather intelligence and sabotage communist infrastructure and communications facilities. The recruits were trained in bases at Nha Trang, Đà Nẵng, and sometimes offshore in Taiwan, Guam and Okinawa. Around eighty groups of operatives, each numbering six or seven men, were deployed in 1963. They entered the north via parachute drops or sampan journeys at night, but nearly all were captured or killed. The captives were frequently used in communist propaganda broadcasts. Tung was criticised for his management of the operations.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{he served}} as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1948. Then in 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, {{the head of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other {{intelligence}} agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a new sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower Administration in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961.|$|E
5|$|His {{investigations}} angered many in Mexico's {{political elite}} {{and made him}} a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, {{the former head of}} Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized the role of the U.S. government and <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Miskovsky left <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> 1964, {{and worked}} for the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department for four years. In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as {{general counsel for the}} Federal Home Loan Bank Board.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} {{founding}} of <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> 1947 as the successor to the Office of Strategic Services, the author provides the reader with a chronological overview of the agency's history. He documents the CIA's involvement in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, and provides a biographical assessment of the motivations of Mohammad Mosaddegh, the Iranian leader deposed in the coup. In briefly describing individuals, organizations and events related {{to the history of}} the CIA, Smith notes Russian intelligence Colonel Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel), and discusses the U.S. intelligence operation that used a front company called Zenith Technical Enterprises. The chronological presentation of CIA history is used to provide additional background with regard to the agency's involvement with the War on Terror. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in March 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Camp Chapman {{attack was}} a suicide attack by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi against the Central Intelligence Agency {{facility}} inside Forward Operating Base Chapman on December 30, 2009. FOB Chapman is located near the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost, which is about 10 miles northwest of the border with Pakistan. One of the main tasks of the CIA personnel stationed at the base was to provide intelligence supporting drone attacks against targets in Pakistan. Seven American CIA officers and contractors, an officer of Jordan's intelligence service, and an Afghan working for the CIA were killed when al-Balawi detonated a bomb sewn into a vest he was wearing. Six other American CIA officers were wounded. The bombing was the most lethal attack against <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> more than 25 years.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Vietnamese {{military}} was highly factionalized in complicated and unusual ways, {{and it was}} not clear where the sympathies of the respective officers lied. Thi was pro-Buddhist, but he and Kỳ had been suspected of mooting a coup attempt against Khánh in September 1964, and he had also been reported by <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>in</b> December 1964 as having vowed to kill Khánh. Although Kỳ had made comments hinting threats to Khánh, he was also known to be strongly opposed to nominally hardline Catholic Diệm supporterssuch as Thảowho were currently the frontrunners to launch the coup. Meanwhile, the likes of Thiệu, Có and Cang, whom the Americans favored, and were Catholic-aligned in more moderate ways, were cautious in comparison to the flamboyant and impetuous Kỳ and Thi. They maintained a guarded approach, waiting to see what the other officers would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative. For his part, Kỳ was reported by US intelligence to have privately predicted that Khánh would be ousted in an efficient manner without bloodletting and replaced by Thiệu.|$|E

5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> <b>In</b> January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed {{as soon as he was}} captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift, which was fitted with a parcel bomb, was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.|$|E
