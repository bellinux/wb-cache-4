5|$|Lyrical poets {{often took}} their {{subjects}} from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents. Additionally, myth {{was central to}} classical Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took most of their plots from myths {{of the age of}} heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Frogs.|$|E

The film proved another hit, and she was given top billing {{in a string of}} Joe Pasternak-produced musicals including A Date with Judy (1948) with schoolmate Elizabeth Taylor.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the Greek New Comedy of Menander and its similarities to Plautus, it is necessary to discuss, in juxtaposition with it, the days of Greek Old Comedy and its evolution into New Comedy. The ancient Greek playwright who best embodies Old Comedy is Aristophanes. A playwright of 5th century Athens, he wrote works of political satire such as The Wasps, <b>The</b> <b>Birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Clouds. Aristophanes' work is noted for its critical commentary on politics and societal values, which is the key component of Old Comedy: consciousness {{of the world in which}} it is written, and analysis of this world. Comedy and theater were means for the political commentary of the time—the public conscience.|$|E
25|$|As a result, a study {{into the}} risks of bird strikes at KSIA was commissioned, with special {{attention}} being paid to the barn swallows at Mount Moreland. The study showed that the early morning dispersals of swallows generally happen before any scheduled arrivals or departures (earlier than 06:00), and the late afternoon swarms take place below the airport approach path, with only 5% of the birds protruding up into the path for {{a very short time}} (around 10 minutes). It was also noted that larger bird species, flying at higher altitudes, would pose more of a risk to aircraft than the swallows, such species already being a risk at Durban International Airport. The study concluded that it would definitely be possible for the airport and swallows to co-exist. Proposed risk mitigation measures included curtailing flight movements during the afternoon swarm, setting the glide slope approach to Runway 06 to 3.2 or 3.5 degrees rather than the standard 3 degrees (to stay above <b>the</b> <b>birds),</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> installation of a radar system that would monitor bird movements and be integrated into the operational plan of the airport.|$|E
25|$|A {{study from}} the University of Michigan {{conducted}} by Laina Bay-Cheng explored how school based sex education sometimes enforces traditional gender roles due to the “normalization” of heterosexual penile vaginal intercourse in monogamous relationships with socially accepted gender roles. The same programs fail to discuss the diversity of human sexual activities that do not fit inside the “norm.” The study also suggested that these programs can portray girls as sexual victims and evoke such popular phrases as “boys will be boys” when discussing sexual assault and rape, leading students to believe that girls should be more responsible {{in order to avoid}} sexual assault. Other studies, such as Karin Martin’s article “Gender Differences in the ABC’s of <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bees: What Mothers Teach Young Children About Sexuality and Reproduction” explore the different ways adolescents learn about sexuality from various sources, such as the media, religion, and family culture, specifically parents. This study asserts that gender roles, while introduced at very early ages, are emphasized and reinforced at adolescence. Paul Dale Kleinert also conducted research regarding this topic. His 2016 dissertation reviews the ways that school based sex education is rooted in societal structures such as gender roles, but the type of program, comprehensive, abstinence-only, or abstinence-plus, can greatly affect how strict and/or how traditional gender roles within sexuality are portrayed.|$|E

500|$|Nainoa's {{ambition}} was to sail Hōkūle‘a to Tahiti as navigator {{by using}} recreated traditional techniques. He spent years training {{on his own}} and with Mau. Mau's training and mentoring helped Nainoa achieve that goal in the 1980 Tahiti voyage. It marked the first time in over 500 years that a Native Hawaiian had mastered the stars, the seas, <b>the</b> <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> winds to guide a sailing canoe from Hawaii to Tahiti and back. The two men joined again for the 19851987 Voyage of Rediscovery to New Zealand, again with Nainoa as principal navigator and Mau as mentor. The voyage to New Zealand stoked Māori interest in cultural history, navigation techniques, and canoe building. It also brought to life for Māori the stories in their folklore of the great canoe voyages of migration and settlement in Aotearoa (New Zealand). Describing a ceremony held at Waitangi to commemorate the Hawaii New Zealand voyage of Hōkūle‘a, Nainoa writes: ...|$|E

Rav Hisda taught that the {{designation}} of one of the birds to become the burnt-offering and the other to become the sin-offering was made either by the owner or by the priest's action. Rabbi Shimi bar Ashi explained that the words of [...] "she shall take [...] [...] [...] the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering", indicated that the mother could have made the designation when taking <b>the</b> <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> words of [...] "the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering", and of [...] "the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering", indicated that (absent such a designation by the mother) the priest could have made the designation when offering them up.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} that {{followed}} Meredith chose to move further south where the birds were [...] "reported to be fairly tame", but there was only limited success in spite of his efforts. By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers noted that [...] "each pack seems to have its own leader now - a big black-plumed bird which stands fully six feet high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them of our approach." [...] At one stage Meredith {{even went so far as}} to mount one of the guns on a truck: a move that proved to be ineffective, as the truck was unable to gain on <b>the</b> <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ride was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired. The number of birds killed is uncertain: one account claims just 50 birds, but other accounts range from 200 to 500—the latter figure being provided by the settlers. Meredith's official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties.|$|E

Most of these sequences are featured {{near the end of}} the episode, but have occasionally occurred at the beginning ("Mr. Monk Takes the Stand") or towards the middle.

Harold Krenshaw gives a fictitious summation about Monk in [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy". Monk states a summation twice, in flashback and in present, in [...] "Mr. Monk and Little Monk" [...] as himself and as young Monk. In at least three episodes ("Mr. Monk and the Garbage Strike", [...] "Mr. Monk Gets Hypnotized", and [...] "Mr. Monk and the Lady Next Door"), Monk gives multiple versions of the same summation, but all except for the last one are false as a result of his being unable to concentrate. In [...] "Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever", Monk and Disher give simultaneous summations of different crimes.|$|E
