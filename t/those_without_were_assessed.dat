40|$|Background: The dismal {{survival}} {{associated with}} esophagectomy for cancer {{has led to}} the search for potentially correctable factors responsible for this poor prognosis. Although it is intuitive that technical complications could increase postoperative mortality, the effect on long-term survival is controversial. Methods: From 1990 to 2002, 434 patients underwent resection for squamous cell carcinoma of the intrathoracic esophagus. Prospectively collected data were reviewed for the presence of technical complications. Patient, tumor, and operative variables, postoperative outcome, and survival were compared between patients with technical complications and <b>those</b> <b>without.</b> Prognostic factors <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> by multivariate analysis. Results: Technical complications occurred in 98 (22. 6 %) patients. Patients with technical complications had a higher prevalence of cardiac disease, more proximal tumors, and more cervical anastomoses. Technical complications were associated with an increased rate of pulmonary complications (37. 8 % vs. 10. 7 %; P <. 001) and increased hospital mortality (9. 2 % vs. 3. 3 %; P =. 025), but no difference in 30 -day mortality (2 % vs. 1. 2 %; P =. 6). Poor-prognostic factors for survival included male sex, stage III/IV disease, cirrhosis, proximal tumors, and R 1 /R 2 resection, but not technical complications. Conclusions: Although immediate postoperative outcome and hospital mortality rates were increased, no effect on long-term survival was seen in patients with complications related to errors in surgical technique. © 2006 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Results: The model with all five items (age; smoking history; the presence of wheeze, dyspnea, and phlegm) compared with models with combinations of fewer items had the highest classification accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0. 720) with sensitivity and specificity of 73. 2 % and 58. 2 %, respectively. The presence of three or more factors yielded the highest AUC, a result suggesting that three or more affirmative answers is the most appropriate criterion indicating presence of airflow obstruction.

40|$|Electrocardiogram (ECG) {{recordings}} {{are central}} to the diagnosis and management of patients with cardiac complaints in primary care, although some concerns remain about the diagnostic accuracy of the general practitioners interpreting them. 1 – 3 Previous research has estimated accuracies of up to 70 % for the detection of abnormalities on ECGs by GPs. The validity of these estimates has been limited by factors including the assistance of interpretive recorders; 4 GP awareness of being studied, leading to use of other diagnostic support; 5 or testing of GPs under exam conditions outside of the clinical setting. Interpretation of ECGs in a nonclinical setting may produce poor results due to time constraints and lack of patient history. 6 In daily clinical practice, it is important for GPs to correctly identify abnormalities on ECGs so the appropriate treatment or referral can be provided to patients. 4 This is one area of research where a retrospective analysis may produce a more valid estimate than a cross sectional or prospective design. this study aimed to retrospectively assess the accuracy of key findings on the ecG by Gps based on subsequent referrals to cardiology clinics at a public hospital. the previously unreported topic of appropriateness of referrals to cardiology clinics of patients with ecGs compared to <b>those</b> <b>without</b> ecGs <b>was</b> also <b>assessed.</b> Methods the study sample came from logan hospital, a medium sized public hospital in southeast Queensland. it consisted of all patient referrals from Gps directly to the cardiology clinic or to the hospital emergency department and subsequently referred on to the cardiology clini...|$|R
40|$|Background Delirium {{is highly}} prevalent, {{especially}} in older patients. It independently leads to adverse outcomes, but remains under-detected, particularly hypoactive forms. Although early identification and intervention is important, delirium prevention {{is key to}} improving outcomes. The delirium prodrome concept has been mooted for decades, but remains poorly characterised. Greater understanding of this prodrome would promote prompt identification of delirium-prone patients, and facilitate improved strategies for delirium prevention and management. Methods Medical inpatients of ≥ 70 years were screened for prevalent delirium using the Revised Delirium Rating Scale (DRS [...] ‐R 98). <b>Those</b> <b>without</b> prevalent delirium <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> daily for delirium development, prodromal features and motor subtype. Survival analysis models identified which prodromal features predicted the emergence of incident delirium in the cohort {{in the first week}} of admission. The Delirium Motor Subtype Scale- 4 was used to ascertain motor subtype. Results Of 555 patients approached, 191 patients were included in the prospective study. The median age was 80 (IQR 10) and 101 (52. 9 %) were male. Sixty-one patients developed incident delirium within a week of admission. Several prodromal features predicted delirium emergence in the cohort. Firstly, using a novel Prodromal Checklist based on the existing literature, and controlling for confounders, seven predictive behavioural features were identified in the prodromal period (for example, increasing confusion; and being easily distractible). Additionally, using serial cognitive tests and the DRS-R 98 daily, multiple cognitive and other core delirium features were detected in the prodrome (for example inattention; and sleep-wake cycle disturbance). Examining longitudinal motor subtypes in delirium cases, subtypes were found to be predominantly stable over time, the most prevalent being hypoactive subtype (62. 3 %). Discussion This thesis explored multiple aspects of delirium in older medical inpatients, with particular focus on the characterisation of the delirium prodrome. These findings should help to inform future delirium educational programmes, and detection and prevention strategies...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: During the menstrual period, {{pregnancy}} and menopause breast is constantly affected physically and physiologically. The importance of breast diseases increase {{with the growing}} number of breast cancers. Given the high prevalence of breast disorders, this study was conducted to investigate the factors influencing breast lumps in women referring to health centers in 1390 in Aran and Bidgol. Materials & methods: This case-control study was conducted on 198 women without breast lump and 198 with breast lump that referred to health centers of Aran and Bidgol. Data was collected through a questionnaire containing demographic, fertility and its diagnosis. Findings: The results showed that the chances of having a mass in patients with benign cysts compared to <b>those</b> <b>without,</b> <b>is</b> equal to OR = 0. 76. Chances of having a mass in people with a record of fibrocystic to <b>those</b> <b>without</b> cysts <b>is</b> OR = 5, and the chances of having a mass in patients with fibro adenoma to <b>those</b> <b>without,</b> <b>is</b> equal to OR = 33. Only the result for having a record of fibro adenomas was significant. Discussion & conclusions: Benign breast lumps in the majority of cases occur in women of reproductive age. Although most common in lumps of reproductive age have been fibrocystic and fibroadenomas, because of significant associations the incidence of mass with history of lumps is recommended to paying more attention to early detection, screening studies and check in younger women than to western country women...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This was a prospective observational study where 125 patients with sepsis and 38 <b>without</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed.</b> Trend of microalbuminuria <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> from the change of ACR value within 6 hours of admission (ACR 1) to the ACR value at 24 hours (ACR 2) in both groups of patients.

The levels decreased in survivors with sepsis after 24 hours, whereas they continued to remain almost at the same levels among <b>those</b> <b>without</b> sepsis. The change in microalbuminuria levels over 24 hours can be used to measure the effectiveness of therapy.
