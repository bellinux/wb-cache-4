6000|$|Nor {{will the}} {{practice}} of art afford you pleasure only; it affords besides an admirable training. For the artist works entirely upon honour. The public knows little or nothing of those merits in the quest of which you are condemned to spend the bulk of your endeavours. Merits of design, the merit of first-hand energy, the merit of a certain cheap accomplishment which {{a man of the}} artistic temper easily acquires - these they can recognise, and these they value. But to those more exquisite refinements of proficiency and finish, which the artist so ardently desires and so keenly feels, for which (in the vigorous words of Balzac) he must toil [...] "like a miner buried in a landslip," [...] for which, day after day, he recasts and revises and rejects - <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> <b>mass</b> of the public must be ever blind. To those lost pains, suppose you attain the highest pitch of merit, posterity may possibly do justice; suppose, as is so probable, you fall by even a hair's breadth of the highest, rest certain they shall never be observed. Under the shadow of this cold thought, alone in his studio, the artist must preserve from day to day his constancy to the ideal. It is this which makes his life noble; it is by this that {{the practice of}} his craft strengthens and matures his character; it is for this that even the serious countenance of the great emperor was turned approvingly (if only for a moment) on the followers of Apollo, and that sternly gentle voice bade the artist cherish his art.|$|E

The bones of the mammalia are filled up, and their coverings have become more simple. Man possesses the most perfect osseous structure, the least and most insignificant covering.

Porphyrigeniti sumus! In Man the centripetal and individualizing tendency of all Nature is itself concentred and individualized—he is a revelation of Nature! Henceforward, he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge; and he who stands the most on himself, and stands the firmest, is the truest, because the most individual, Man. In social and political life this acme is inter-dependence; in moral life it is independence; in intellectual life it is genius. Nor does the form of polarity, which has accompanied the law of individuation up its whole ascent, desert it here. As the height, so the depth. The intensities must be at once opposite and equal. As the liberty, so must be the reverence for law. As the independence, so must be the service and the submission to the Supreme Will! As the ideal genius and the originality, in the same proportion must be the resignation to the real world, the sympathy and the inter-communion with Nature. In the conciliating mid-point, or equator, does the Man live, and only by its equal presence in both its poles can that life be manifested! ...|$|E

The fortune of a tale lies not alone in the skill of him that writes, but as much, perhaps, in the inherited experience of him who reads; and when I hear with a particular thrill of things that I have never done or seen, it is one of that innumerable army of my ancestors rejoicing in past deeds.

Each has his own tree of ancestors, but at the top of all sits Probably Arboreal; in all our veins there run some minims of his old, wild, tree-top blood; our civilised nerves still tingle with his rude terrors and pleasures; and to that which would have moved our common ancestor, all must obediently thrill.|$|E

Three Mars mission scenarios provide the context within which the performance of the platforms is evaluated. The mission scenarios are used to derive the performance requirements including the range and flight path to be covered, the altitude at which the platforms fly, and the scientific investigations to be performed along with the associated scientific instrumentation to be carried as payload. Existing platform designs are used {{for the purpose of this}} comparative study and are modified depending on specific mission requirements. A set of weighted performance metrics, including <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> takeoff <b>mass,</b> power required, manoeuvrability, and complexity, serves as a common basis for comparing the performance of the three aerial platforms. The results of this comparative study indicate that the airship is best suited for all mission scenarios considered due to its simplicity and high degree of manoeuvrability. However, it is important to note that a series of subjective design choices with respect to platform speed and available power were made that significantly impact the overall performance of the platforms. Altering these design choices as well as the mission requirements could result in a different platform being best suited for each Mars mission. For instance, increasing the cruising velocity of the fixed-wing aircraft may allow its dimensions to be scaled down thereby reducing the complexity and making it a more competitive platform for long-range missions. In addition, for short-range missions that do not require a high degree of manoeuvrability but where <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> takeoff <b>mass</b> and complexity are more important factors, the rotary-wing aircraft becomes the best option...|$|R

Einstein's equation, by theory, can give these energies by measuring mass differences before and after reactions, but in practice, these mass differences in 1905 were still too small to be measured in bulk.

However, radioactivity seemed to proceed at its own unalterable (and quite slow, for radioactives known then) pace, and even when simple nuclear reactions became possible using proton bombardment, the idea that these great amounts of usable energy could be liberated at will with any practicality, proved difficult to substantiate. Rutherford was reported in 1933 to have declared that this energy could not be exploited efficiently: [...] "Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of the atom is talking moonshine." ...|$|E

Em função da concentração de fenol de 164 mg/Kg na massa bruta este resíduo foi classificado de acordo com a NBR 10. 004 (ABNT), como Classe I - perigoso. O trabalho teve como objetivos o isolamento dos microrganismos do solo e seleção dos mais eficientes na degradação de fenol para estudo de biodegradação dos compostos incorporados no resíduo. Foram isolados três grupos de microrganismos: bactérias, fungos e actinomicetos, da mistura solo/areia de moldagem. Estes microrganismos foram selecionados quanto a produção de fenol oxidases através da Reação de Bavendamm e, da concentração de 1200 mg/L de fenol, no ensaio de MCI. Para avaliar a eficiência de degradação destes microrganismos foi utilizado o método respirométrico de Bartha. Os microrganismos foram introduzidos nos respirômetros, através de inóculos de cada grupo e culturas mistas, incubados a 28 °C por 90 dias.

The predicted gradient values coincide with the observed vertical fall-off in the rotation curve of the Galaxy.

The agreement of the results with the gradient measurements is remarkable in view of other more complicated, non-gravitational mechanisms used for explaining the observed gradient values. Finally, we find that models with a significant spheroidal component give worse vertical gradient estimates than the simple disc model. In view of these results, we can surmise that, apart from the central spherical bulge and Galactic halo, <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> <b>mass</b> distribution in the Galaxy forms a flattened rather than spheroidal figure.

40|$|Purpose: Tumors are {{composed}} {{of a large number}} of clonogens that have the capability of indefinite reproduction. Even when there is complete clinical or radiographic regression of <b>the</b> <b>gross</b> tumor <b>mass</b> after treatment, tumor recurrence can occur if the clonogens are not completely eradicated by radiotherapy. This study was to investigate the colonogen number and its association with the tumor control probability (TCP) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCCA). Methods: A literature search was conducted to collect clinical information of patients with OSCCA, including the prescription dose, tumor volume and survival rate. The linear-quadratic (LQ) model was incorporated into TCP model for clinical data analysis. The total dose ranged from 60 to 70 Gy and tumor volume ranged from 10 to 50 cc. The TCP was calculated for each group according to tumor size and dose. The least χ^ 2 method was used to fit the TCP calculation to clinical data while other LQ model parameters (α, β) were adopted from the literature, due to the limited patient data. Results: A total of 190 patients with T 2 –T 4 OSCCA were included. The association with HPV was not available for all the patients. The 3 -year survival rate was about 82...|$|R
60|$|Secondly, Another great {{cause of}} ignorance is the want of ideas we are capable of. As the want of ideas which our faculties {{are not able}} to give us shuts us wholly from those views of things which it is {{reasonable}} to think other beings, perfecter than we, have, of which we know nothing; so the want of ideas I now speak of keeps us in ignorance of things we conceive capable of being known to us. Bulk, figure, and motion we have ideas of. But though we are not without ideas of these primary qualities of bodies in general, yet not knowing what is the particular bulk, figure, and motion, of the greatest part of the bodies of the universe, we are ignorant of the several powers, efficacies, and ways of operation, whereby the effects which we daily see are produced. These are hid from us, in some things by being too remote, and in others by being too minute. When we consider the vast distance of the known and visible parts of the world, and the reasons we have to think that what lies within our ken is but {{a small part of the}} universe, we shall then discover a huge abyss of ignorance. What are the particular fabrics of the great masses of matter which make up the whole stupendous frame of corporeal beings; how far they are extended; what is their motion, and how continued or communicated; and what influence they have one upon another, are contemplations that at first glimpse our thoughts lose themselves in. If we narrow our contemplations, and confine our thoughts to this little canton--I mean this system of our sun, and <b>the</b> <b>grosser</b> <b>masses</b> of matter that visibly move about it, What several sorts of vegetables, animals, and intellectual corporeal beings, infinitely different from those of our little spot of earth, may there probably be in the other planets, to the knowledge of which, even of their outward figures and parts, we can no way attain whilst we are confined to this earth; there being no natural means, either by sensation or reflection, to convey their certain ideas into our minds? They are out of the reach of those inlets of all our knowledge: and what sorts of furniture and inhabitants those mansions contain in them we cannot so much as guess, much less have clear and distinct ideas of them.|$|R
5000|$|A nuclear thermal rocket is a {{proposed}} spacecraft propulsion technology. In a nuclear thermal rocket a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated {{to a high}} temperature in a nuclear reactor, and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. In this kind of thermal rocket, the nuclear reactor's energy replaces the chemical energy of the propellant's reactive chemicals in a chemical rocket. The thermal heater / inert propellant paradigm {{as opposed to the}} reactive propellants of chemical rockets turns out to produce a superior effective exhaust velocity, and therefore a superior propulsive efficiency, with specific impulses on the order of twice that of chemical engines. <b>The</b> overall <b>gross</b> lift-off <b>mass</b> of a nuclear rocket is about half that of a chemical rocket, and hence when used as an upper stage it roughly doubles or triples the payload carried to orbit.|$|R
