5|$|Although {{political}} parties fund their campaigns using donations {{or their own}} assets, the government reimburses them for each parliamentary seat won. For instance, each seat won in the 2011 parliamentary election brought a party 180,000kuna (euros). Smaller sums were paid <b>to</b> <b>parties</b> or candidates failing to win any parliamentary seats, provided that they received more than {{five percent of the}} votes cast in a constituency.|$|E
5|$|Amazon river dolphins, {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in their mythology as wielding superior musical ability, their seductiveness and love of sex, often resulting in illegitimate children, and their attraction <b>to</b> <b>parties.</b> Despite {{the fact that the}} Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Weissweiler {{does not}} dismiss the {{possibility}} that Busch's increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations <b>to</b> <b>parties,</b> and publisher Otto Basserman sent him to Wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.|$|E

Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations <b>to</b> <b>parties,</b> may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E
5|$|The Angolan Civil War was notable {{due to the}} {{combination}} of Angola's violent internal dynamics and massive foreign intervention. The war became a Cold War struggle, as both the Soviet Union and the United States, along with their respective allies, provided significant military assistance <b>to</b> <b>parties</b> in the conflict. Moreover, the Angolan conflict became closely intertwined with the Second Congo War in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{as well as with}} the South African Border War.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} signing, the Act {{was taken to}} Germany and handed <b>to</b> <b>parties</b> in the Reichstag. On February 18, the text was reprinted in German newspapers, {{including}} Das Neue Litauen, Vossische Zeitung, Taegliche Rundschau and Kreuzzeitung. In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers, particularly in Lietuvos aidas, the Council's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona; but the German authorities prohibited this publication. Although {{the majority of the}} copies of the issue were confiscated, the newspaper's editor, Petras Klimas, managed to hide about 60 of them.|$|E
5|$|The Sainte-LaguÃ« {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats <b>to</b> <b>parties.</b> As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a party with {{a high number of}} votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less than its share of votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of seats in the Parliament are {{allocated}} <b>to</b> <b>parties</b> proportionally {{to the number of}} votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.|$|E

5|$|From 1904 to 1906, Duke Peter was {{appointed}} to a military post in Tsarskoye Selo, a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg. In Tsarskoye Selo, the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family, who lived at the Alexander Palace near her own residence. Olga prized her connection to the Tsar's four daughters. From 1906 to 1914, Olga took her nieces <b>to</b> <b>parties</b> and engagements in Saint Petersburg, without their parents, every weekend throughout the winter. She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called Shvipsik ("little one"). Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met Rasputin, a self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him. As Olga grew close to her brother's family, {{her relationship with her}} other surviving brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael {{and the rest of the}} family was essentially cut off.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification <b>to</b> <b>Parties</b> publication.|$|E
5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed <b>to</b> <b>parties</b> to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element of liability for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the coup remain the subject of debate. The {{domestic}} situation was definitely troubled; historians have pointed to specific European precedents in the 1920s that may have had an influence, including the 1922 March on Rome by Benito Mussolini in Italy and the May 1926 Coup of JÃ³zef PiÅsudski in Poland. Other historians have cited more general trends in Europe that resulted in more or less undemocratic governments in almost all Central and Eastern European nations {{by the end of}} the 1930s. Democratic immaturity was displayed by an unwillingness to compromise, and the frequent shifts of government created a chronic perception of crisis. Historians have also discussed an exaggerated fear of communism as a factor, along with the lack of a stable center that could reach out <b>to</b> <b>parties</b> on the left and right; these parties accused each other of Bolshevism and fascism. According to historian Anatol Lieven, Smetona and Voldemaras saw themselves as the dispossessed true heroes of the independence movement, who despaired of returning to power by democratic means.|$|E
