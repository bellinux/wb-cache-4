5|$|In 2010, President Obama {{signed into}} effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

5|$|In {{the decades}} <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> <b>the</b> Ministerium became less {{concerned}} with {{its relationship with the}} Reformed church and saw a significant increase in Lutheran identity and the importance of the Lutheran Confessions. Thus, in 1853, the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod. However, this renewed relationship would prove to be short-lived.|$|E

5|$|In the {{investigation}} <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> <b>the</b> evidence quickly pointed to Jereboam O. Beauchamp, 23, who had married the much older Anna Cooke in 1824.

5|$|In {{the months}} <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> <b>the</b> 24th Division played an {{important}} part of Operation Desert Shield by providing heavy firepower with its large number of armored vehicles, including 216 M1A1 Abrams tanks. Elements of the division were still arriving in September, and in the logistical chaos <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> rapid arrival of U.S. forces in the region, the soldiers of the 24th Division were housed in warehouses, airport hangars, and on the desert sand. The 24th remained in relatively stationary positions in defense of Saudi Arabia until additional American forces arrived for Operation Desert Storm.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} elections in 1996, the BJP capitalised on the communal polarisation <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> demolition to win 161 Lok Sabha seats, {{making it the}} largest party in parliament.

5|$|In {{the years}} <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> accident, {{airlines}} started using Type IV deicing fluid, {{which is more}} effective than both Type I and Type II fluids.

5|$|With the two {{remaining}} guns removed to Fort Corcoran for storage and the garrison sent home, the fort was left abandoned. Due to its proximity to Washington and the large influx of freed blacks to the city <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> end of the Civil War, the fort became residence to many squatters, {{most of whom were}} African-American.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> <b>the</b> elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi, {{the first}} {{ruler of the}} Al Said dynasty, {{blockaded}} Muscat and captured the forts in 1749. He renovated them, particularly al-Jalali.

5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk {{extensively about}} the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom period <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, {{as they can be}} for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E
