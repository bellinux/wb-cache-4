5|$|The Byzantine {{victory was}} {{ultimately}} a pyrrhic one, as the devastating {{impact of the}} war left the Byzantines in much weakened state. Within a few years both empires were overwhelmed by the onslaught of the Arabs who had become newly united by Islam, ultimately leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> conquest of Persia in 644 and {{the fall of the}} Sasanian dynasty in 651.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the Byzantine-era church in Jifna testifies to the {{existence}} of a Christian community prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> conquest. It continued to exist during the Middle Ages and the village is still inhabited mainly by Christians. The names of Christian inhabitants from Jifna appeared in a 10th-century inscription on a stone above the gate of St. George's Monastery in the Wadi Qelt.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was never}} active politically, it was rumored that his fame alarmed Umar, who then {{recalled}} him from the army.

To relieve them of this belief, Umar recalled Khalid, to which Khalid agreed.|$|E

5|$|A {{very small}} number of Muslims managed to escape to France and from there <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> North Africa. Some revolted against this orderfor example, a revolt broke out in the Serra d'Espadà. The crown's troops {{defeated}} this rebellion in a campaign which included the killing of 5,000 Muslims. After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally converted to Christianity. Mosques were demolished, first names and family names were changed, and the religious practice of Islam was driven underground.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increasing}} Muslim resentment {{against the use}} of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried out {{under the supervision of the}} Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.|$|E

He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops. But Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|In April 637, the Arabs, {{after a long}} siege {{captured}} Jerusalem, {{which was}} surrendered by Patriarch Sophronius. In the summer of 637, the Muslims conquered Gaza, and, during the same period, the Byzantine authorities in Egypt and Mesopotamia purchased an expensive truce, which lasted three years for Egypt and one year for Mesopotamia. Antioch fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> armies in late 637, and by then the Muslims occupied the whole of northern Syria, except for upper Mesopotamia, which they granted a one-year truce.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> threat, {{which reached}} its peak {{in the first half}} of the 8th century, the Isaurian emperors adopted the policy of Iconoclasm, which was abandoned in 786 only to be readopted in the 820s and finally abandoned in 843. Under the Macedonian dynasty, exploiting the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate, the Byzantines gradually went into the offensive, and recovered much territory in the 10th century, which was lost however after 1071 to the Seljuk Turks.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem was an {{important}} city of the Byzantine province of Palestina Prima. Just 23 years prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> conquest, in 614, it fell to an invading Sassanid army under Shahrbaraz during {{the last of the}} Byzantine-Sassanid Wars. The Persians looted the city, and are said to have massacred its 90,000 Christian inhabitants. As part of the looting, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was destroyed and the True Cross captured and taken to Ctesiphon as a battle-captured holy relic. The Cross was later returned to Jerusalem by Emperor Heraclius after his final victory against the Persians in 628. It was believed that the Jews, who were persecuted in their Roman-controlled homeland, had aided the Persians.|$|E

5|$|On 15 August, the Battle of Yarmouk was fought, {{it lasted}} for 6 days {{and ended in}} a devastating defeat for the Byzantines. The Battle of Yarmouk is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most decisive battles of history. It was a historic defeat that sealed the fate of Byzantium in the Levant, the magnitude of the defeat was so intense that Byzantine forces were unable to recover from it for some time. It left the whole of the Byzantine Empire vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> Arab armies. The battle was the greatest battle ever fought on Syrian soil up to that point, and is believed to be the tactical marvel of Khalid.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Muhammad, many {{powerful}} Arab tribes broke away in open revolt against the rule of Medina. Caliph Abu Bakr sent his armies to counter the rebels and apostates. Khalid was one of Abu Bakr’s main advisers and an architect of the strategic planning of the Riddah wars. He was given the command over the strongest Muslim army and was sent towards central Arabia, the most strategically sensitive area where the most powerful rebel tribes resided. The region was closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> stronghold of Medina and was {{the greatest threat to}} the city. Khalid first set out for the rebel tribes of Tayy and Jalida, where Adi ibn Hatim—a prominent companion of Muhammad, and a chieftain of the Tayy tribe—arbitrated, and the tribes submitted to the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|By that time, the Byzantines had {{captured}} Arsamosata and additional strategically important {{locations in the}} mountains of southwest Armenia, posing a direct threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> emirates around Lake Van. To reverse the situation, in 940Sayf al-Dawla initiated a remarkable campaign: starting from Mayyafiriqin (Byzantine Martyropolis), he crossed the Bitlis pass into Armenia, where he seized several fortresses and accepted the submission of the local lords, both Muslim and Christian. He ravaged the Byzantine holdings around Theodosiopolis and raided as far as Koloneia, which he besieged until Kourkouas arrived with a relief army and forced him to withdraw. Sayf al-Dawla was not able to follow up on this effort: until 945, the Hamdanids were preoccupied with internal developments in the Caliphate and with fighting against their rivals in southern Iraq and the Ikhshidids in Syria.|$|E

5000|$|As 'Amr {{surveyed}} the military situation, {{he felt that}} Alexandria would be a hard nut <b>to</b> crack. [...] <b>The</b> Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria, and they were determined to offer stiff resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> They mounted catapults {{on the walls of}} the city, and these engines pounded <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> with boulders. This caused considerable damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> and 'Amr ordered his men back from the advance position so that they might be beyond the range of the missiles. A see-saw war followed. When <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> tried <b>to</b> go close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city they were hit with missiles. When the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b>|$|R
5|$|Defeat at the Battle of Ajnadayn left Syria {{vulnerable}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army. Khalid {{decided to}} capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. At Damascus, Thomas, son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, {{was in charge}} of the city's defense. Receiving intelligence of Khalid’s march towards Damascus he prepared the city's defences. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius, who was at Emesa that time, for reinforcement. Moreover, Thomas, in order to delay or halt Khalid's advance and to attain time to prepare for a siege, sent his armies to move forward. Two of his armies were routed first at Yaqusa in mid-August and the other at Maraj as-Saffar on 19 August. Meanwhile, Heraclius' reinforcements reached Damascus before the other column of Heraclius reached the city which Khalid laid siege to on 20 August. To isolate Damascus from the rest of the region, Khalid placed the detachments south on the road to Palestine and in north at the Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards Damascus. Heraclius' reinforcements were intercepted and routed by Khalid at the Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab 30km from Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to respond {{effectively}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> advance in Africa, because the two decades between 695 and 715 were a period of great domestic turmoil. They did react with raids of their own in the East, {{such as the one}} in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph al-Walid I (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor Anastasios II (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by Theodosius III (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by Leo III the Isaurian (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final Arab siege of Constantinople. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and Bulgar attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Muslim Arabs from Arabia in the 630s {{resulted in the}} rapid loss of Byzantium's southern provinces (Syria and Egypt) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> Caliphate. Over the next fifty years, under the aggressive Umayyad caliphs, the Muslims would launch repeated raids into still-Byzantine Asia Minor, twice threaten the Byzantine capital, Constantinople with conquest, and outright conquer the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa. The situation did not stabilize until after {{the failure of the}} Second Arab Siege of Constantinople in 718, when the Taurus Mountains on the eastern rim of Asia Minor became established as the mutual, heavily fortified and largely depopulated frontier. Under the Abbasid Empire, relations became more normal, with embassies exchanged and even periods of truce, but conflict remained the norm, with almost annual raids and counter-raids, sponsored either by the Abbasid government or by local rulers, well into the 10th century.|$|E

5|$|The main Sassanid {{force was}} {{destroyed}} at Nineveh in 627, and in 629 Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in a majestic ceremony, as he marched into the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, where anarchy {{and civil war}} reigned {{as a result of}} the enduring war. Eventually, the Persians were obliged to withdraw all armed forces and return Sassanid-ruled Egypt, the Levant and whatever imperial territories of Mesopotamia and Armenia were in Roman hands at the time of an earlier peace treaty in c. 595. The war had exhausted both the Byzantines and Sassanids, however, and left them extremely vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> forces that emerged in the following years. The Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat by the Arabs at the Battle of Yarmouk in 636, while Ctesiphon fell in 637.|$|E
5|$|Whilst outnumbered, the Muslims {{gained the}} early {{initiative}} {{and forced the}} Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a serious mistake was committed by {{a part of the}} Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of Muhammad's orders by the Muslim archers, who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan cavalry, led by Meccan war veteran Khalid ibn al-Walid, which brought chaos <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further, but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.|$|E
5|$|Following Innocent III's Fourth Council of the Lateran, crusading resumed in 1217 against Saladin's Ayyubid successors in Egypt and Syria {{for what}} is {{classified}} as the Fifth Crusade. Led by Andrew II of Hungary and Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, forces drawn mainly from Hungary, Germany, Flanders, and Frisia achieved little. Leopold and John of Brienne besieged and captured Damietta but an army advancing into Egypt was compelled to surrender. Damietta was returned and an eight-year truce agreed. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, was excommunicated for breaking a treaty obligation with the Pope that required him to lead a crusade. However, since his marriage to Isabella II of Jerusalem gave him a claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem, he finally arrived at Acre in 1228. Frederick was culturally the Christian monarch most empathetic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> world, {{having grown up in}} Sicily, with a Muslim bodyguard and even a harem. His great diplomatic skills meant that the Sixth Crusade was largely negotiation supported by force. A peace treaty was agreed upon, giving Latin Christians most of Jerusalem and a strip of territory that linked the city to Acre, while the Muslims controlled their sacred areas. In return, an alliance was made with Al-Kamil, Sultan of Egypt, against all of his enemies of whatever religion. The treaty and suspicions about Frederick's ambitions in the region made him unpopular, and he was forced to return to his domains when they were attacked by Pope Gregory IX. While the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy were in conflict, it often fell to secular leaders to campaign. What is sometimes known as the Barons' Crusade was led by Theobald I of Navarre and Richard of Cornwall; it combined forceful diplomacy and the playing of rival Ayyubid factions off against each other. This brief renaissance for Frankish Jerusalem was illusory, being dependent on Ayyubid weakness and division following the death of Al-Kamil.|$|E
