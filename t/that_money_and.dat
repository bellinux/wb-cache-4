25|$|It is {{impossible}} to discuss motivation and job attributes in I–O psychology without crediting Frederick Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory (also referred to as Herzberg's Two-factor theory). Published in 1968, Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is {{the primary source of}} motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. For an organization {{to take full advantage of}} Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.|$|E

At a second meeting, held on 30 December Kenyatta is accused of giving some MPs and Mungiki coordinators 3.3 million Kenyan shillings each (approximately $35,000) with which to buy guns to attack Nakuru.

2500|$|Some public voices {{oppose the}} current {{practice}} of government.

Certain citizens reject the idea of using tax payer money to build tax-exempt tribal casinos which generate tax-exempt revenues. [...] Another complaint from other U.S. citizens is the negative effects casinos have on nearby neighborhoods. They argue that casinos increase the amount of traffic, pollution, and crime. As a result, cities find themselves paying the cost of dealing with these issues.|$|E
