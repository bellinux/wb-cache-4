40|$|Large scale data {{analysis}} and mining activities require so-phisticated information extraction queries. Many queries require complex aggregation, {{and many of}} these aggregates are non-distributive. Conventional solutions to this problem involve defining User Defined Aggregate Functions (UDAFs). However, the use of UDAFs entails several problems. Defin-ing a new UDAF can be a significant burden for the user, and optimizing queries involving UDAFs is difficult because of the “black boxn nature of the UDAF. In this paper, we present a method for expressing nested aggregates in a declarative way. A nested aggregate, which is a rollup of another aggregated value, expresses a wide range of useful non-distributive aggregation. For example, most frequent type aggregation can be naturally expressed using nested aggregation, e. g. “For each product, report its total sales during the month with the largest <b>total</b> <b>safes</b> of the product”. By expressing complex aggregates declaratively, we relieve the user of the burden of defining UDAFs, and allow the evaluation of the complex aggregates to be opti-mized. We use the Extended Multi-Feature (EMF) syntax as the basis for expressing nested aggregation. An advantage of this approach is that EMF SQL can already express a wide range of complex aggregation in a succinct way, and EMF SQL is easily optimized into efficient query plans. We show that nested aggregation queries can be evaluated efficiently by using a small extension to the EMF SQL query evaluation algorithm. A side effect of this extension is to extend EMF SQL to permit complex aggregation of data from multiple sources. ...|$|R

40|$|Diseases {{associated}} with the thyroid gland {{are one of the}} most frequently seen endocrine disorders across the globe.

Since, in the recent years, the incidence of thyroidectomy is in increasing trend in south Indian population, this review aims to study the available data regarding the appropriateness and safety of total thyroidectomy and compares it with subtotal thyroidectomy and other thyroid surgeries. This is a retrospective comprehensive review of various articles and publications regarding total and partial thyroidectomy performed across the world. Many retrospective studies and few prospective studies suggest that the incidence of transient hypocalcemia is higher after total thyroidectomy than after subtotal thyroidectomy, but the incidence of other complications including recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and postoperative hematoma is not significantly different between the two procedures.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of prospectively gathered data on 11 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy under general anaesthesia between January 2008 and December 2013 for AIT at our University Hospital. All patients were preoperatively treated with carbimazole, steroids and β-receptor antagonists.

We {{pay particular attention to}} female mortality in the two prime reproductive age groups 15 - 29 and 30 - 44. The data for the study are taken from the Sample Registration System, available n an annual basis since 1970. Gender differentials, as well as rural urban differentials, have narrowed down considerably over the period from 1970, but both types of differences persist still. On the whole, the rural-urban differences over this period seem to be much larger than the gender differentials so that rural females still suffer from the double disadvantage of being female and belonging to rural areas. Of the correlates we considered, all the three, viz., <b>total</b> fertility rate, <b>safe</b> motherhood indices and health care supply are strongly correlated with female mortality especially in the 15 - 29 age group.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a seven-step procedure for developing environmentally <b>safe</b> <b>total</b> maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for selenium. The {{need for this}} information stems from recent actions taken by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that may require TMDLs for selenium and other contaminants that are impairing water bodies. However, there is no technical guidance from EPA or elsewhere that deals exclusively with selenium. This leaves biologists and environmental contaminant specialists without the tools needed to effectively address the TMDL issue for selenium. This article provides guidance by laying out an assessment method that links the basic components of EPA’s TMDL process to the contaminant-specific information required for selenium. The underlying principle in this process is that selenium concentrations be kept below levels that threaten reproduction of fish and aquatic birds. The steps are: (1) Delineate and characterize the hydrological unit (HU, i. e., water body) of interest. (2) Determine selenium concentrations and assess biological hazard. (3) Determine sources, concentrations, and volumes of selenium discharges; calculate existing selenium load. (4) Estimate retention capacity of HU for selenium. (5) Calculate the total allowable selenium load and specify rednctions needed to meet the target loading. (6) Allocate selenium load among discharge sources. (7) Monitor to determine effectiveness of selenium load reduction in meeting environmental quality goals. Proper application of this procedure will ensure compliance with EPA regulatory requirements and also protect fish and wildlife resources. t 2002 ~kerier Scieim (USA...|$|R

Primary tumors were found in 17 patients, seven of whom also had metastatic tumors. No tumors were found in nine patients. Nine patients are dead; the actuarial survival rate for all patients was 75 % at 5 years and 52 % at 10 years. Eleven of the 27 patients had the multiple endocrine neoplasia I syndrome. Of the 18 survivors, only three have normal serum gastrin levels, and all three had extrapancreatic gastrinomas, one in peripancreatic lymph nodes, one in the liver, and one in a cystic tumor attached to the stomach. Nutritional results were good to excellent, with a mean postoperative weight loss of 14. 7 % (mean follow-up period was 45 months). The authors conclude that treatment of the hypersecretory problems of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome by <b>total</b> gastrectomy is <b>safe</b> and dependable. Results compare well with those of long-term medical management, whose success is dependent upon serial favorable responses to a lifetime of repeated challenges...|$|R
