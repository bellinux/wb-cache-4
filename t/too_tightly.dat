Again the police arrived, and carried the suitcase {{away from the house}} and out in the open. But while they were cutting open the suitcase, the clockwork alarm went off inside the suitcase. The police ran to safety just before the bomb exploded.

25|$|As {{the first}} MiGs were 20km out and {{approaching}} from the west, Amos Amir led his four aircraft in a 270° climbing turn {{that brought them}} on a westerly heading. They had, however, turned <b>too</b> <b>tightly.</b> Instead of drawing the MiGs westward, they were now facing them head-on. As the Mirages were {{closing in on the}} MiGs, the four Phantoms were approaching the area at low altitude and at a line abreast. The original plan had called for the Phantoms to zip in from below, behind and beneath the MiG-21s pursuing the Mirages, and pick them off with their radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrows. This was now no longer possible and as the Phantoms entered the fray, a close-quarters dogfight commenced.|$|E
25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down <b>too</b> <b>tightly,</b> or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E

40|$|Massive {{black holes}} (MBHs) in galactic nuclei are {{believed}} to be surrounded by a high density stellar cluster, whose mass is mostly in hard-to-detect faint stars and compact remnants. Such dark cusps dominate the dynamics near the MBH: a dark cusp in the Galactic center (GC) of the Milky Way would strongly affect orbital tests of General Relativity there; on cosmic scales, dark cusps set the rates of gravitational wave emission events from compact remnants that spiral into MBHs, and they modify the rates of tidal disruption events, to list only some implications.

25|$|The primary {{challenge}} of project management {{is to achieve}} all of the project goals within the given constraints. This information is usually described in project documentation, created {{at the beginning of}} the development process. The primary constraints are scope, time, quality and budget. The secondary — and more ambitious — challenge is to optimize the allocation of necessary inputs and apply them to meet pre-defined objectives. The object of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the client's objectives. In many cases the object of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief in order to feasibly be able to address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established they should impact on all decisions made by other people involved in the project-project managers, designers, contractors, sub-contractors, etc. If the project management objectives are ill-defined or <b>too</b> <b>tightly</b> prescribed it will have a detrimental effect on decision making.|$|E
25|$|Five {{more bodies}} were {{recovered}} on February 20, and Ordinary Seaman Frank Fisher died that {{day of his}} wounds. Several more bodies were recovered on February 21. Divers discovered another 20 bodies trapped below the forward hatch of the center section on February 23, but only three {{were brought to the}} surface as wreckage prevented the rest from being immediately retrieved. Two more of the wounded died that day as well. Another 12 bodies were recovered from near the engine rooms on February 22, all of them dismembered and badly disfigured. Work to free the bodies below the forward hatch continued on February 22, and was largely successful the following day. All but one was brought to the surface, and that body was <b>too</b> <b>tightly</b> caught in the wreckage to free. Another body rose of its own accord to the surface, and divers reported seeing several bodies trapped in twisted metal or in places where divers could not reach.|$|E
25|$|The two-tier {{structure}} established was also seen as problematic. In particular, {{the division of}} planning between districts and counties {{was a source of}} friction between the new councils. Thamesdown Borough Council called for a further reform and complete abolition of counties as they felt Wiltshire County Council was unable to respond to the needs of an expanding urban area. Further complaints surrounded the loss of water supply and sewerage powers to regional water authorities created by the Water Act 1973. This was felt to reduce the ability of district councils to plan new housing developments. It was also felt that the boundaries of the metropolitan counties were <b>too</b> <b>tightly</b> drawn, leaving out much of the suburban areas of the conurbations. The leading article in The Times on the day the Act came into effect noted that the new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively.|$|E

But in her sisterly affection she took Mr Jonas to task for leaning so very hard upon a broken reed, {{and said that he}} must not be so cruel to poor Merry any more, or she (Charity) would positively be obliged to hate him. Mercy, who really had her share of good humour, only retorted with a laugh; and they walked home in consequence without any angry passages of words upon the way. Mr Jonas being in the middle, and having a cousin on each arm, sometimes squeezed the wrong one; so <b>tightly</b> <b>too,</b> as to cause her not a little inconvenience; but as he talked to Charity in whispers the whole time, and paid her great attention, no doubt this was an accidental circumstance. When they arrived at Todgers's, and the door was opened, Mercy broke hastily from them, and ran upstairs; but Charity and Jonas lingered on the steps talking together for more than five minutes; so, as Mrs Todgers observed next morning, to a third party, 'It was pretty clear what was going on THERE, and she was glad of it, for it really was high time that Miss Pecksniff thought of settling.' ...|$|R

Forbes reported that Madonna's performance was the most-watched moment of the night. Her effort to sing live without Auto-Tune during the choreographed performance was also widely praised. She also performed the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25, 2015. However, {{in the early stages}} of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting: [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine".

2500|$|Mitrailleuses {{were used}} {{in many of the}} major engagements of the war, but their small numbers greatly {{restricted}} their effectiveness. Their flawed usage was a serious problem on the battlefield. While the mitrailleuses were inherently accurate, in a ballistic sense, they were often unable to zero in on targets quickly enough at great distances. Individual 25 round salvos were also <b>too</b> <b>tightly</b> grouped and lacked lateral dispersion. To make matters worse, the complex firing mechanism was vulnerable to damage at the hands of inexperienced crews. [...] Fouling of the mechanism by black powder combustion residues and thus difficulties in closing the breech were reported as a problem after prolonged firings.|$|E
2500|$|Loading cannons or bombards {{before the}} powder-making {{advances}} of the Renaissance was a skilled art. Fine powder loaded haphazardly or <b>too</b> <b>tightly</b> would burn incompletely or too slowly.

When the cannon was fired through the touchhole, turbulence from the initial surface combustion caused the rest of the powder to be rapidly exposed to the flame.|$|E
2500|$|The Torah {{does not}} give {{specific}} reasons {{for most of the}} laws of kashrut. However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community. The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained. In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because [...] "they are unclean". The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods, but are <b>too</b> <b>tightly</b> bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.|$|E
