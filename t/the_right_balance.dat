5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E

25|$|For a retailer, finding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> between {{breadth and}} depth can be a key to success. An average {{supermarket}} might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth). Specialty retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while Aldi carries just 1,400 lines per store.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E

500|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, with a 55%. rating. Pierson praised the episode's plot, the {{handling}} of Peter and Stewie, {{and some of the}} cutaways. He criticized the relationship between Lois and Peter as unconvincing. At the end of his review he stated, [...] "Family Guy doesn’t seem to have found <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> yet between silliness and seriousness.

[...] Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was [...] "on target, topical and funny," [...] and added, [...] "He was as relaxed, amusing and at home as Johnny Carson."

He was displeased with the discovery that {{it had all been}} a hallucination and stated that Rory's death and other instances of horror [...] "never shock in the way you might expect". However, he praised Smith for being [...] "on blindingly good form" [...] while portraying the Doctor's quirkier traits, considered that Gillan and Darvill were [...] "fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history", and said Jones was [...] "a lot of fun to watch" [...] despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor's dark side.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hockey stick}} {{consists}} of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has {{a big impact on}} its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balanced</b> flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong [...] "whip-back" [...] which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.|$|R

Paul Rudnick did some work on Miranda's scenes, {{followed}} by a Don Roos rewrite. After that, Aline Brosh McKenna, {{who was able to}} relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story, produced a draft after a month's work that struck <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version, rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda. She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship [...] "very liberating ...

[...] Commenting on finding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige said [...] "Iron Man is a very technological hero; his movies are always technologically based. The first Thor was all about introducing Asgard and Thor in that more fantastical realm into the more reality-based MCU… As we go into Ultron clearly he does come out of technology, but we're using all of our tools at our disposal that we've established so far as part of the MCU to build the storyline of Age of Ultron." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{replace the}} [...] "Italian" [...] style of Trapattoni, Koeman wanted Benfica {{to have a}} [...] "Dutch" [...] approach; he said, [...] "A team like Benfica always has to play to win.

Vital to his new formation, Koeman asked for more wingers, such as Andy van der Meyde, and Boudewijn Zenden, but Benfica did not sign them. Instead, he received attacking midfielders Diego Souza, Andrei Karyaka and Giorgos Karagounis. To improve Koeman's options up-front, composed of Nuno Gomes and Mantorras, Benfica tried but failed to sign Jon Dahl Tomasson. Koeman instead received Italian international Fabrizio Miccoli on loan from Juventus. In defence, Benfica added Brazilians Anderson, Léo, with Nélson [...] replacing Miguel, who moved to Valencia.|$|E

Club describing its contents as [...] "idealized 1950s culture, industrial design, midgets, [...] physical deformity". In addition, the film features two separate but connected worlds, another hallmark of Lynch's writings. The film's art direction would have featured a heavily industrial backdrop, setting the action against an [...] "oil slick, smokestack, steel-steam-soot, fire-sparks and electrical arcs realm", similar to the direction ultimately taken in the depiction of Victorian England in The Elephant Man and the planet Giedi Prime in Dune. Although Lynch's first two feature-length films were shot in black-and-white, he had hoped to film Ronnie Rocket in color, inspired by the works of French film-maker Jacques Tati.

500|$|Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film's soundtrack album. It was {{released}} by Varèse Sarabande on October 12, 2010. The score was composed by Michael Giacchino.

He mentioned, [...] "I {{was always trying to}} say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [...] was like, 'no, put it in!'" [...] In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed. Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, [...] "…it was tricky finding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> of, well, should this be scary?

[...] In addition, Blake was complimentary toward Stritch's role on the show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't the best Christmas episode that [...] has had.
