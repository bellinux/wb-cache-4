5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
5|$|Fleas lay tiny, white, oval eggs. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> {{are small}} and pale, have {{bristles}} covering their worm-like bodies, lack eyes, and have mouth parts adapted to chewing. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> feed on organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas, which contain dried blood. Adults feed only on fresh blood.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> of Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae) {{are almost}} {{omnivorous}} and consume such substances as paint and shoe polish. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> of the shore flies (Ephydridae) and some Chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers (Diamesa sp., Chironomidae), hot springs, geysers, saline pools, sulphur pools, septic tanks and even crude oil (Helaeomyia petrolei). Adult hoverflies (Syrphidae) {{are well known}} for their mimicry and <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects. Some brachycerans are agricultural pests, some bite animals and humans and suck their blood, and some transmit diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Ascosphaera apis is a {{fungal disease}} that infests the gut of <b>the</b> <b>larva.</b> [...] <b>The</b> fungus competes with <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> for food, {{ultimately}} {{causing it to}} starve. The fungus {{then goes on to}} consume the rest of <b>the</b> <b>larva's</b> body, causing it to appear white and 'chalky'.|$|R
50|$|The adult moth is pale {{gray and}} up to 12 mm long, with dark bands. The hindwings are grayish-white. The {{wingspan}} is between 16 mm and 20 mm. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> (caterpillar) is off-white with a darker head and small black spots on its body. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> emerge from tube-like structures about 7 days after they hatch. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> is about 12 mm long when mature. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> then {{find a place to}} spin a cocoon. When <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> spin cocoons, they turn to a reddish-brown color. It takes about 8-12 days for <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> to become a moth and it takes 2-4 weeks for the egg to become an adult. The female moth lays 120-680 small white eggs. These eggs commonly attach to food and they hatch within 3-8 days.|$|R
50|$|Medetomidine {{can be used}} as an {{antifouling}} {{substance in}} marine paint. It is mainly effective against barnacles, but has also shown effect on other hard fouling like tube worms. When <b>the</b> barnacle cyprid <b>larva</b> encounters a surface containing medetomidine the molecule interacts with the octopamine receptor in <b>the</b> <b>larva.</b> This makes <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> legs start kicking and it cannot settle to the painted surface. When <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> swims away from the surface, the effect disappears (reversible effect). <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> regain its function and can settle somewhere else.|$|R
5|$|To develop, <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen {{in one of two}} ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to <b>the</b> <b>larvae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vertebrate predators of bees include bee-eaters, shrikes and flycatchers, {{which make}} short sallies to catch insects in flight. Swifts and {{swallows}} fly almost continually, catching insects as they go. The honey buzzard attacks bees' nests and eats <b>the</b> <b>larvae.</b> The greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding {{them to the}} nests of wild bees. The humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> and the wax. Among mammals, predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> and any stored food.|$|E
5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> have {{received}} an adequate amount of nutrients, <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> then creates a pupal chamber in which <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> {{lies in a}} pre-pupal state with limited mobility, creating its pupa beneath its larval skin. On completing its pupa, <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> then sheds its skin and fills {{the entirety of the}} pupa with hemolymph. When the pupa is completely full and the mandibles fully harden, the soft white pupa gradually darkens to brown, and the pupa becomes harder.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>larva</b> {{will first}} {{feed on the}} leaf hairs and then move onto the leaf epidermis. Feeding occurs in the daytime, {{primarily}} {{in the morning and}} late afternoon. As <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> grow, <b>the</b> feeding becomes a nocturnal activity. When not eating, <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> will remain {{on the underside of the}} leaf and make a mat of silk for attachment.|$|R
5|$|Burying beetles are {{attentive}} parents, {{and participate}} in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring. Both parents work to bury small animal carcass {{to serve as a}} food resource for their young and build a brood chamber around it. The parents prepare the carcass and protect it from competitors and from early decomposition. After their eggs hatch, the parents keep <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> clean of fungus and bacteria and help <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing <b>the</b> <b>larvae.</b>|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E

50|$|Below ground {{large number}} of larva are {{consumed}} by moles. During rainy periods, when the burrows of <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> are flooded, <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> will crawl to the surface. At these times <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> are subject to predation by raccoons, gophers, skunks, opossums, chipmunks and birds.Birds will also attack the adult, notably the common crow, common grackle, mocking bird and blue jay.|$|R
5|$|Parsnip {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> of some {{lepidopteran}} species, including the parsnip swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes), the common swift moth (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|E

25|$|The lateral {{processes}} on <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> {{are believed}} to aid in floatation and buoyancy, allowing <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> to breathe in their preferred semi-liquid media.|$|E
50|$|The {{head end}} of the larval case is closed by an operculum. On the {{underside}} of <b>the</b> operculum <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> spins a mat of silk. This may be grasped by the mandibles of <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> and pulled down to close <b>the</b> aperture. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> attaches stone weights {{to the top of}} the operculum, assisting in the closing of the operculum.|$|R
50|$|The female seaweed crab lays fertilized {{eggs from}} which larvae develop and break free. The eggs are bright orange when freshly laid and turn brown as they {{approach}} time to hatch, and are approximately 0.75mm across. There are multiple stages of <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> before they reach maturity including pre-zoea, zoea 1, zoea 2, and megalopa. When <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> hatches it is enclosed in a thin and transparent covering that is shed shortly after. Then this comes the first zoea stage during which <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> is about 3.0mm. Zoea 1 lasts 8-16 days before the exoskeleton of <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> is shed and it enters zoea 2. At zoea 2 <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> is about 3.5mm long. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> transforms into megalopa after 12-15 days at a temperature of 16 degrees Celsius. After 20 days, <b>the</b> megalopa <b>larva</b> moults into a juvenile crab. They shed their shells every few months in order to grow, and will grow faster if they live in warmer water. Seaweed crabs typically grow to 5cm across and live for approximately two years.|$|R
50|$|Horn {{dragonfly}}: The adult horn dragonfly {{lives on}} land, {{while most of}} <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> reside in <b>the</b> water of <b>the</b> wetland. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> feed on small insects such as mosquitoes.|$|R
25|$|The S. nudiseta flies {{are one of}} {{the first}} to arrive on the source of their food and lay their eggs, which are about 1.3mm long. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> however, develop more slowly when {{compared}} to <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> of the flies that arrive with S. nudiseta. Pupatation occurs even later with <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> of the later arriving fly species.|$|E
25|$|Little is {{recorded}} on {{the appearance of}} <b>the</b> <b>larvae.</b> They {{are commonly known as}} white grubs, a general term for <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> of most scarab beetles.|$|E
25|$|Adult females lay about 200 {{transparent}} eggs (each about 1 mm long) into moist soil. After {{about one}} week, <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> hatch. About 90% of <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> are female. Up to 2,500 per m² {{can be found}}. Several species, especially Sciara militaris, can be found to migrate in processions of up to 10 m, containing thousands of individuals. These processions occur from May to June in central Europe. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> there pupate from July to August.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>larva</b> inside <b>the</b> egg becomes fully {{developed}} in about {{one month after}} being laid and then enters diapause to overwinter. The egg is in the overwintering stage lasting for eight or nine months. Development ceases {{in preparation for the}} winter. After an acclimation stage, during which <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> inside <b>the</b> egg reduces its water content, eggs can withstand freezing temperatures. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> inside <b>the</b> egg resumes activity in the spring, and reabsorbs water. <b>The</b> <b>larva</b> will then chew through the chorion of the egg and the protective hair of the egg cluster in the spring.|$|R
25|$|The {{larval food}} plants in Southern Africa are Sclerocroton integerrimus (Sapium integerrimum) and the jumping-seed tree (Sclerocroton ellipticus). In Kenya, the larva have been {{recorded}} on Excoecaria, Phyllanthus, Macaranga, Kigelia and Sterculia. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> are gregarious and at first only eat the upper layer of the leaves, working from the tip to the base, and leaving a pale green dead leaf behind. As they grow older, <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> begin to eat the entire leaf, starting at the leaf margin. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> defoliate individual trees.|$|E
25|$|Assassin bugs feed on <b>the</b> <b>larvae.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} whether male Thaumatichthys are parasitic. The {{structure}} of the jaws in mature males suggests that feeding is impaired after metamorphosis. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> are epipelagic like those of other deep-sea anglerfishes, and are found at depths {{of no more than}} 100 m. As <b>the</b> <b>larvae</b> grow and approach metamorphosis, they descend deeper until they reach the bottom. <b>The</b> <b>larvae</b> can be identified by their divided operculum and a subdermal pigment layer that covers the entire head and body.|$|E
50|$|Venom {{extractor}} syringes {{can remove}} larvae with ease at any stage of growth. As these devices {{are a common}} component of first-aid kits, this is an effective and easily accessible remedy. A larva has also been successfully removed by first applying several coats of nail polish {{to the area of}} <b>the</b> <b>larva's</b> entrance, weakening it by partial asphyxiation. Covering the location with adhesive tape would also result in partial asphyxiation and weakening of <b>the</b> <b>larva,</b> but is not recommended because <b>the</b> <b>larva's</b> breathing tube is fragile and would be broken during the removal of the tape, leaving most of <b>the</b> <b>larva</b> behind.|$|R
