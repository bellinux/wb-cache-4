5|$|Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass is a {{collection}} of essays written by British writer, doctor, and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple and published in book form by Ivan R. Dee in 2001. In 1994, the Manhattan Institute started publishing the contents of these essays in the City Journal magazine. They are about personal , the mentality of society as a whole, and <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> the underclass. Dalrymple had problems in finding a British publisher to help him turn his individual essays into {{a collection}}, so he eventually turned to American companies for publication.|$|E
5|$|Sometime I {{have thought}} that {{impossible}} it had been, so to have removed my affection {{from the realm of}} Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me. But God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and appearing to be) in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Now one of Edward's strongest supporters, he {{accompanied}} the king {{on a campaign}} to Scotland in 1314, when several other nobles refused. He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24June, under somewhat unclear circumstances. Gloucester was {{the most prominent of}} the casualties of the battle, which ended in a humiliating defeat for England. As he had no issue, his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family. His estates were divided between his three sisters, one of whom was married to the king's new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger. Despenser's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales led directly to <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> EdwardII's later reign, including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326.|$|E

5|$|Gardens, or yards, around medieval castles, abbeys {{and houses}} were formal {{and in the}} European {{tradition}} of herb garden, kitchen garden and orchard. They were often surrounded by defensive walls and they sometimes adjoined a hunting park. The first Renaissance style gardens in Scotland were built for the Stewart dynasty at their royal palaces. French gardeners were hired by James IV at Stirling in 1501 and James V at Holyrood in 1536, where archaeological remains indicate there were sophisticated formal gardens. Similar landscaping is also found at Falkland and Linlithgow, including the king's knot garden at Stirling. From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. These were seen as retreats from <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> the world and were eulogised in country house poetry like that of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649). Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a herb garden at Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} the closing days of the Battle of Britain that the {{flagship}} Ju 88 A-4 went into service. Although slower yet than the A-1, it solved nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> the A-1. The A-4 actually saw additional improvements including more powerful engines but, unlike other aircraft in the Luftwaffe, did not see a model code change. The Ju 88 C-series also benefited from the A-4 changes.|$|E
25|$|This {{classical}} Romanian fascist movement {{merged into}} the more powerful National Romanian Fascio, then reconstructed itself under Bacalogu's own leadership. It survived <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> 1923, but was disbanded by government order in 1925, and was entirely eclipsed by the Iron Guard. Shunned by Mussolini, Bacaloglu lived her final decades in relative obscurity, enmeshed in political intrigues. Her fascist ideas were taken up by some in her family, including her brother Sandi and her son Ovid O. Densusianu.|$|E
25|$|Although {{relatively}} few early modern gardens have survived unchanged, {{they can be}} seen in the maps of Timothy Pont (c. 1565–1614) from the 1590s, which depict abbeys, castles and estate houses surrounded by greenery, earthworks, orchards and arboretums. From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. These were seen as retreats from <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> the world and were eulogised in country house poetry like that of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649).|$|E

25|$|The Shire {{was first}} settled by Hobbits {{in the year}} 1601 of the Third Age (Year 1 in Shire Reckoning); they were led by the {{brothers}} Marcho and Blanco (modelled on Hengist and Horsa). The Hobbits (who originally lived in the vale of Anduin) had migrated west over the perilous Misty Mountains in the decades before that, and before entering the Shire they had lived in Dunland {{and parts of the}} depopulated Arnorian splinter-realms Cardolan and Rhudaur. It has been speculated that the Hobbits had originally moved west to escape <b>the</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> Mirkwood, and the evil caused by the Easterlings.|$|E
25|$|Heywood's {{first play}} {{may have been}} The Four Prentises of London (printed 1615, but acted some fifteen years earlier). This tale of four {{apprentices}} who become knights and travel to Jerusalem may have been intended as a burlesque of the old romances, {{but it is more}} likely that it was meant seriously to attract the apprentice spectators to whom it was dedicated. Its popularity was satirized in Beaumont and Fletcher's travesty of the middle-class taste in drama, The Knight of the Burning Pestle. Heywood's two-part history plays Edward IV (printed 1600), and If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody, or, <b>The</b> <b>Troubles</b> <b>of</b> Queene Elizabeth (1605 and 1606) concern, respectively, The Wars of the Roses and the life of the Queen contrasted with that of the preeminent merchant and financier Thomas Gresham.|$|E
