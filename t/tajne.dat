The second largest center for Polish underground publishing was Kraków. There, writers and editors faced similar dangers: for example, almost the entire editorial staff of the underground satirical paper Na Ucho was arrested, and its chief editors were executed in Kraków on 27May 1944. (Na Ucho was the longest published Polish underground paper devoted to satire; 20issues were published starting in October 1943.) The underground press was supported by a large number of activists; in addition to the crews manning the printing presses, scores of underground couriers distributed the publications.

5000|$|Karski's 1942 {{report on}} the Holocaust and the London Polish government's appeal to the United Nations were briefly narrated by Walter Laqueur in The Terrible Secret (1980). Karski became a public figure thanks to Elie Wiesel who made him a keynote speaker at the Concentration Camps Liberators Conference (1981) and French {{film-maker}} Claude Lanzmann for Lanzmann's film Shoah made with Karski's testimony. The film was released in 1985 and included parts {{of the first day}} of a 2-day interview Lanzman had had with Karski (only 40 minutes of the almost 9 hours of interview time.) The segment ends with Karski stating he made his report. On the second day of interviews, as Lanzman recalls, he met with a very different Karski, who recounted in precise details his meeting with Roosevelt and other high officials, notably Justice Frankfurter who, Karski recalls, did not believe him. According to Lanzman, the tone and style of the second day of interviews was so different, and the interview so long, that it would not fit into Lanzman's vision. The missing segment was released separately in 2010, possibly in response to a controversy following the release of a novel on Karski's World War II activities. Earlier, in their book on Karski, Wood and Jankowski state that Karski wrote an article (which was published in English, French and Polish) called [...] "Shoah, a Biased Vision of the Holocaust", in which he pleaded for the production of another documentary showing the missing part of his testimony and the help given to Jews by Polish Righteous among the Nations. In 1994, E. Thomas Wood and Stanisław M. Jankowski published Karski: How One Man Tried to Stop the Holocaust. In 2010, Lanzmann released a further documentary entitled The Karski Report consisting of the previously unreleased second half of his interview with Karski. In 1997, the documentary film My Mission directed by Waldemar Piasecki and Michal Fajbusiewicz was released, presenting as never before all details of Karski’s war mission. In 1999, <b>Tajne</b> Panstwo book (Polish, re-edited and re-wrote by Waldemar Piascecki version of Story of A Secret State) got its premiere in King’s Place in Warsaw and became a bestseller. In the same year, Jan Karski’s Room was opened in the Museum of Lodz City. The exposition grouped the most valuable memorabilia, documents and decorations organized under Karski's supervision.|$|E
