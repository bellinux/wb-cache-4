6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to kill big game," [...] I heard some one say, who it was I really forget, [...] "there's the man <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it--Hunter Quatermain; the best shot in Africa and one of the finest fellows, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is part of}} the cure, Rose, and I put {{you here}} that you might take my three great {{remedies}} in the best and easiest way. Plenty of sun, fresh air, and cold water; also cheerful surroundings, and some work; for Phebe is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> take care of this room, and be your little maid as well as friend and teacher. Does that sound hard and disagreeable to you, dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, there's nothin' {{the matter}} with her estimation," [...] said Andy. [...] "That's level enough. I only told <b>you</b> that <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can always expect her to turn up unexpected." ...|$|R
60|$|Here, {{immediately}} under, I took a rude sketch just <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{a glacier}} looks close at hand.|$|R
60|$|I come, then, in {{the next}} place, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> Jesus Christ {{addressed}} himself {{to the work of}} man's redemption.|$|R
6000|$|I will merely {{begin the}} task of examination, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> set about it. Take {{the head of the}} {{commanding}} Christ. Although inclined forward from the shoulders in the advancing motion of the whole body, the head itself is not stooped; but held entirely upright, the line of forehead sloping backwards. The command is given in calm authority; not in mean anxiety. But this was not expressive enough for the copyist,-- [...] "How much better I can show what is meant!" [...] thinks he. So he puts the line of forehead and nose upright; projects the brow out of its straight line; and the expression then becomes,--"Now, be very careful, and mind what I say." [...] Perhaps you like this 'improved' action better? Be it so; only, it is not Giovanni Pisano's design; but the modern Italian's.|$|E
6000|$|... 23. And {{now it is}} {{both time}} for you to begin to learn the {{mechanical}} use of the brush; and necessary for you to do so in order to provide yourself with the gradated scale of color which you will want. If you can, by any means, get acquainted with any ordinary skillful water-color painter, and prevail on him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> lay on tints with a brush, by all means do so; not that you are yet, nor for a long while yet, to begin to color, but because the brush is often more convenient than the pencil for laying on masses or tints of shade, and the sooner you know how to manage it as an instrument the better. If, however, you have no opportunity of seeing how water-color is laid on by a workman of any kind, the following directions will help you:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{it was on}} {{just such}} a night that, my dear old father and mother were burnt out of house and home," [...] said the blacksmith; [...] "well do I mind about it, for I was over ten {{years old at the}} time. We never found out what it was that set the house alight, but when it had once caught, it fetched way like lightning--the wind was so high. The first thing that woke me was sneezin' wi' the smoke. Then, I'd just opened my eyes when I saw the head of a ladder come crash through the window. It was the fire-escape. Father tried to save mother, but he was lame, and fell down half-choked. I tried to help him, but I was too young. Then a {{strapping}} fireman stepped in at the window, as cool as a cucumber, pitched us all into the escape, one after another; and so, through God's mercy, we were saved. I've loved the firemen ever since. They are the boys <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do things well; to do things with might and main, and no fuss, and to submit to discipline without a word." ...|$|E
60|$|SECOND. And {{thus have}} I <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> what this throne of grace is, {{and where it}} stands. And now I shall come <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> shall find it, and know when you are come to it, by several other things.|$|R

6000|$|And you young people, {{who have}} no {{authority}} over anyone, but over your own bodies; to whom the Lord has given {{little or nothing to}} manage and take care of except your own health and strength--do not let the devil tempt you to believe that that health and strength is your own property, to do what you like with. It belongs to the Lord who died for you, and He will require an account from you how you have used it. Do not let the devil tempt you to believe that the Lord delays His coming to you--that you may do what you like now, in the prime of your years, and that it will be time enough to think about God and religion when God visits you with cares, and sickness, and old age. That is the fancy of too many; but it will surely {{turn out to be a}} mistake. Those who misuse their youth, and health, and strength, in tyrannising over those who are weaker than themselves, and laughing at those who are not as clever as themselves, and eating and drinking with the drunken--the Lord will come to them in an hour when they are not aware, and cut them asunder, in some way or other, by loss of work, or poverty, or sickness, or doubt and confusion, and bitter shame and perplexity of mind; till they find out, poor things, that they have been living like the unbelievers all their youth, without God in the world, while God's love and God's teaching, and God's happiness was ready for them; and have to go back again to their Father and their Lord, and cry: [...] "Father, we have sinned against heaven and before Thee, and are no more worthy to be called Thy children!" [...] Oh, you who have been fancying that the Lord was gone far away, and that you had a right to do what you liked with the powers which He has given you, go back to Him, now at once, and confess that you, and all belonging to you, belong to Him, and ask Him to teach you how to use it aright. Ask Him to teach you how to please Him with it, and not yourselves only. Ask Him to teach you how to do good to all around you, and not merely to do what you like. Ask Him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do your duty to Him, and to your neighbours, for whom He died on the cross, in that station of life to which He has called you. Ask Him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use your property, your knowledge, your business, your strength, your health, so that you may be a blessing and a help to those whom He blesses and helps, and who, He wishes, should bless and help each other. Go back to Him at once, my friends. You will not have far to go, seeing that He is now even among us here hearing my clumsy words; and I do hope, and trust, and pray, bringing them home to some of your hearts with that spirit and power of His, which is like a two-edged sword, piercing to the very depths of a man's heart, and showing him how ugly it is--and how noble the Lord will make it, if he will but repent and pray to Him who never cast out any that came to Him.|$|E
6000|$|You were forever {{finding some}} new play. [...] So when I saw you down {{on hands and}} knees [...] In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay, [...] Trying, I thought, to set it up on end, [...] I went <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make it stay, [...] If that was your idea, against the breeze, [...] And, if you asked me, even help pretend [...] To make it root again and grow afresh. [...] But 'twas no make-believe with you to-day, [...] Nor was the grass itself your real concern, [...] Though I found your hand full of wilted fern, [...] Steel-bright June-grass, and {{blackening}} heads of clover.

[...] You wanted to restore them to their right [...] Of something interposed between their sight [...] And too much world at once--could means be found. [...] The way the nest-full every time we stirred [...] Stood up to us as to a mother-bird [...] Whose coming home has been too long deferred, [...] Made me ask would the mother-bird return [...] And care for them in such a change of scene [...] And might our meddling make her more afraid. [...] That was a thing we could not wait to learn. [...] We saw the risk we took in doing good, [...] But dared not spare to do the best we could [...] Though harm should come of it; so built the screen [...] You had begun, and gave them back their shade. [...] All this to prove we cared. Why is there then [...] No more to tell? We turned to other things. [...] I haven't any memory--have you?-- [...] Of ever coming to the place again [...] To see if the birds lived the first night through, [...] And so at last to learn to use their wings.|$|E
