5000|$|The unique {{feature of}} the Dolinar {{receiver}} is the feedback from the detector and the displacement mechanism in between arrivals of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> copies. Counting either zero photons or one or more photons with the SPD does not give complete information about <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state.</b> Rather, {{whether or not a}} photon was counted gives some information about the state, and a hypothesis can be proposed based on the information from the SPD. With the Kennedy receiver, the displacement is fixed at either [...] or , and depending on which displacement is used and if a photon is counted or not, a best hypothesis as to the nature of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> can be put forth. For example, if the displacement of the Kennedy receiver is set to be , then it can be said the Kennedy receiver is testing the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> was [...] If no photons are counted, it is most likely that the hypothesis was correct and that <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> was displaced to vacuum. If one or more photons are counted, it is known that the guess was wrong as <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> was not displaced to vacuum.|$|E
5000|$|As an example, suppose {{before the}} first copy of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> arrives, the {{receiver}} is set to test for [...] by setting the displacement to [...] At this point, any hypothesis is limited by a 50% chance of guessing <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> on sheer luck alone, and thus the choice is arbitrary. However, suppose <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> is [...] sent, and the displacement does not shift the state to vacuum. As is most likely, now suppose the SPD detects a photon. It is now known that the hypothesis is wrong, and the displacement is switched to [...] before the next copy arrives. Now the next copy is displaced to vacuum, {{and there are no}} photons counted by the SPD. The displacement remains unchanged, and will remain unchanged for each copy of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> that is displaced and counted by the SPD. Which each no count result, the hypothesis becomes stronger. If the [...] was sent initially, then the displacement would never change, and each lack of photon counts reinforces the initial arbitrary guess.|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{the more}} copies of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> being tested reduces {{the chance of}} misidentifying <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state.</b> While {{more complex than the}} Kennedy {{receiver}} and requiring multiple copies of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state,</b> the Dolinar receiver's adaptive feedback offers a mechanism to reduce the chances of a hypothesis being wrong. Further, the Dolinar receiver shows more robustness against dark counts, a real-life phenomenon where SPDs can count a photon even if there is nothing, i.e. vacuum, to detect. If the detector counts a photon even when the hypothesis is correct and <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> copy was displaced to vacuum, the displacement will switch and there is a likely chance another photon will be detected on the next pass, switching the displacement back, where there will be a less likely chance to detect photons for future detection. As long as the rate of dark counts is not too high, the overall history of detection results can give a likely picture as {{to the nature of the}} original input state.|$|E
40|$|Intensity {{correlations}} from linear interactions Abstract: We {{address the}} generation of intensity correla-tions arising from the interference between two optical states interacting through a beam splitter. We consider both phase insensitive and sensitive states and write the intensity correlations as functions of {{the mean number of}} photons and eld quadratures of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>states.</b> In particular we consider Fock number states and squeezed states as a paradigm of non-classical states and mixture of coherent states, which can be experimentally accessi-ble.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model for a noisy {{communication}} channel in which the noise affecting consecutive transmissions is correlated. This model is motivated by fluctuating birefringence of fiber optic links. We analyze the role of entanglement of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>states</b> in optimizing <b>the</b> classical capacity of such a channel. Assuming a general form of an ensemble for two consecutive transmissions, we derive tight bounds on the classical channel capacity depending on whether <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>states</b> used for communication are separable or entangled across different temporal slots. This result demonstrates that by an appropriate choice, the channel capacity may be notably enhanced by exploiting entanglement. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The overlap {{measurement}} scheme accomplishes {{to evaluate}} the overlap of two <b>input</b> quantum <b>states</b> by only measuring an introduced auxiliary qubit, irrespective {{of the complexity of}} <b>the</b> two <b>input</b> <b>states.</b> We find a counterintuitive phenomenon that no quantum dissonance can be found, even though the auxiliary qubit might be entangled, classically correlated or even uncorrelated with <b>the</b> two <b>input</b> <b>states</b> based on different types of <b>input</b> <b>states.</b> In principle, this provides an opposite but supplementary example to the remarkable algorithm of the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit in which no entanglement is present. Finally, we consider a simple overlap measurement model to demonstrate the continuous change (including potential sudden death of quantum discord) with <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>states</b> from entangled to product states by only adjusting some simple initial parameters.

5000|$|The {{feedback}} of the Donlinar receiver works by switching the displacement {{if there was}} a photon counted but the before the next copy of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> arrives. If no photons are detected, the displacement remains unchanged for the next arrival of a copy. For each no count result, it becomes more and more likely that the state copies are being displaced to vacuum and the certainty of the hypothesis increases. [...] On the whole, the history of the detection results in conjunction with their corresponding displacements can give more and more complete information about the most likely identity of <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
50|$|In this experiment, {{multiple}} {{copies of}} <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> are not {{sent to the}} receiver. In order to make multiple adaptive measurements, <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> is divided into ten copies, and each copy is displaced and measured in series. If no photons are detected after displacing a copy, the next displacement remains the same and another reading is taken with a detector. If a photon is detected, the next displacement may change to test a different hypothesis. However, a new hypothesis is not chosen at random. Rather, after a displacement and detection result, a deliberate decision is made on the new hypothesis given the total history of displacements and detection results using Bayesian inference. This ensures {{that each of the}} ten guesses are made as best as possible.|$|E
50|$|The Dolinar {{receiver}} expands {{upon the}} Kennedy receiver {{to decrease the}} probability of error {{at the cost of}} higher complexity.

40|$|We {{study the}} maximum-confidence (MC) {{measurement}} strategy for discriminating among nonorthogonal symmetric qudit states. Restricting to linearly dependent and equally likely pure states, {{we find the}} optimal positive operator valued measure (POVM) that maximizes our confidence in identifying each state in the set and minimizes the probability of obtaining inconclusive results. The physical realization of this POVM is completely determined and it is shown that after an inconclusive outcome, <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>states</b> may be mapped into {{a new set of}} equiprobable symmetric states, restricted, however, to a subspace of the original qudit Hilbert space. By applying the MC measurement again onto this new set, we can still gain some information about <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>states,</b> although with less confidence than before. This leads us to introduce the concept of "sequential maximum-confidence" (SMC) measurements, where the optimized MC strategy is iterated in as many stages as allowed by <b>the</b> <b>input</b> set, until no further information can be extracted from an inconclusive result. Within each stage of this measurement our confidence in identifying <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>states</b> is <b>the</b> highest possible, although it decreases from one stage to the next.

50|$|As already {{mentioned}} above, {{for the implementation}} of a boson sampling machine one necessitates a reliable source of many indistinguishable photons, and this requirement currently remains one of the main difficulties in scaling up the complexity of the device. Namely, despite recent advances in photon generation techniques using atoms, molecules, quantum dots and color centers in diamonds, the most widely used method remains the parametric down-conversion (PDC) mechanism. The main advantages of PDC sources are the high photon indistinguishability, collection efficiency and relatively simple experimental setups. However, one of the drawbacks of this approach is its non-deterministic (heralded) nature. Specifically, suppose the probability of generating a single photon by means of a PDC crystal is ε. Then, the probability of generating simultaneously M single photons is εM, which decreases exponentially with M. In other words, in order to generate <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>state</b> for the boson sampling machine, one would have to wait for exponentially long time, which would kill the advantage of the quantum setup over a classical machine.
