25|$|Adventure {{games have}} strong storylines with {{significant}} dialog, and sometimes make {{effective use of}} recorded dialog or narration from voice actors. This genre of game is known for representing dialog as a conversation tree. Players are able to engage a non-player character by choosing a line of pre-written dialog from a menu, which triggers a response from the game character. These conversations are often designed as a tree structure, with players deciding between each branch of dialog to pursue. However, there are always {{a finite number of}} branches to pursue, and some adventure games devolve into selecting each option one-by-one. Conversing with characters can reveal clues about how to solve puzzles, including hints about what that character would want before they will cooperate with the player. Other conversations will have far-reaching consequences, deciding to disclose a valuable secret that has been entrusted to the player. Characters may also be convinced to reveal their own secrets, either through conversation or by giving <b>them</b> <b>something</b> that will benefit them.|$|E
25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer {{the most important thing in}} his life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost <b>them</b> <b>something</b> they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.|$|E

25|$|These buffers {{have plenty}} of ions in them, which is {{necessary}} for the passage of electricity through <b>them.</b> <b>Something</b> like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis. There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE), Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. lithium borate, which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).|$|E

The two further speculated that Rosen, who often took strongly pro-Israel positions and later became policy director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, may have also perhaps picked up the term from Israeli media and scholars, as the [...] "street" [...] terminology for popular opinion is also used sometimes in Hebrew.|$|E
500|$|According to Ratnam, {{the only}} {{difference}} between Divya and Mouna Ragam was the scene with Karthik (which {{was not part of the}} earlier screenplay). Divya, the story of a young woman settling into an arranged marriage, did not explore her life before the marriage. Ratnam realised that the story needed to satisfy a wider audience, and decided to give <b>them</b> <b>something</b> that would make them accept the character without questioning Divya's actions. The story dealt with an arranged marriage— two strangers suddenly thrown together— and how they adjust. Ratnam originally resisted this, but reconsidered because its suddenness provided a clear rationale for the Divya's resistance to the arranged marriage. Karthik said he was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the cast; his scenes were shot in a week, and his role was [...] "but a cameo".|$|E

500|$|Leng {{has named}} Living in the Material World as his {{personal}} favourite {{of all of}} Harrison's solo albums.

Eder likewise welcomes Material Worlds bold idealism, saying: [...] "Even {{in the summer of}} 1973, after years of war and strife and disillusionment, some of us were still sort of looking – to borrow a phrase from a Lennon–McCartney song – or hoping to get from <b>them</b> <b>something</b> like 'the word' that would make us free.

Grunge's Kurt Cobain has been called the [...] "voice of Generation X", playing the same role for this demographic as Bob Dylan played for 1960s youth and that John Lennon played for the 1970s generation.

500|$|The {{character}} of Nancy Drew {{has gone through}} many permutations over the years. The Nancy Drew Mystery series was revised beginning in 1959; with commentators agreeing that Nancy's character changed significantly from the original Nancy of the books written in the 1930s and 1940s. Commentators also often see {{a difference between the}} Nancy Drew of the original series, the Nancy of The Nancy Drew Files, and the Nancy of Girl Detective series. Nevertheless, some commentators find {{no significant difference between the}} different permutations of Nancy Drew, finding Nancy to be simply a good role model for girls. Despite revisions, [...] "hat hasn't changed, however, are [...] basic values, her goals, her humility, and her magical gift for having at least nine lives. For more than six decades, her essence has remained intact." [...] Nancy is a [...] "teen detective queen" [...] who [...] "offers girl readers something more than action-packed adventure: she gives <b>them</b> <b>something</b> original. Convention has it that girls are passive, respectful, and emotional, but with the energy of a girl shot out of a cannon, Nancy bends conventions and acts out every girl's fantasies of power." ...|$|E
500|$|The side {{stories were}} created so the player could better {{understand}} and empathize with {{the struggles of}} entertainers in the industry and their private lives. Part of the team's struggle was balancing the main story and side missions, and making both appealing to players. During an earlier stage, there was no divide between these two mission types, which ended up clashing with major story events and prompting players to ignore the side stories. To counter this, [...] "Intermission" [...] periods were created where side story chapters could be accessed. In the end, the side stories became {{a large part of}} the game's thematic base, causing Yamagami to consider <b>them</b> <b>something</b> more. The general infusion of Japanese pop idol culture and the performing arts into the title was Atlus' take on traditions within Japanese Shamanism where the dancing of priestesses brought them closer to the gods they worshiped: in the game, it is through their performances that the main characters draw the attention of the Mirages and summon them into the real world. Also working on the scenario was Aoi Akashiro, a writer whose resume included anime and video games.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{has also}} criticized a Christian video game {{based on the}} Left Behind series. In , players {{participate}} in [...] "battles raging {{in the streets of}} New York," [...] according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in [...] "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." [...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant. It's a mass-killing game." [...] Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying [...] "Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, I prefer to give <b>them</b> <b>something</b> that's positive." [...] The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's book, Out of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E
