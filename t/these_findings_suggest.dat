5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain regions}} {{identified}} in the above studies are associated with empathy, compassion, emotional regulation, and cognitive functioning. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that two}} {{processes}} affect the reminiscence bump phenomenon: (1) Events in adolescence are encoded {{more strongly than}} events that occur in other periods of life. (2) Because these events are initially stored more intensely, they will be retrieved more frequently.|$|E
30|$|<b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} {{combination}} of muscle thickness and hardness is capable of effectively estimating muscle strength especially in females.|$|R
30|$|WBM leaf extract showed {{significant}} antioxidant, cyto-protective and anti-melanogenic activities. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> that WBM leaves {{may be beneficial}} for preventing the photo-oxidative damage and melanogenesis of skin.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} {{combination}} of muscle thickness and hardness as assessed by the ultrasound muscle hardness meter is capable of effectively estimating muscle strength of knee extension without muscle contraction especially in females.|$|R
25|$|In vitro {{studies show}} that Notch can {{influence}} neurite development. In vivo, deletion of the Notch signaling modulator, Numb, disrupts neuronal maturation in the developing cerebellum, whereas deletion of Numb disrupts axonal arborization in sensory ganglia. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear, together <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> Notch signaling might be crucial in neuronal maturation.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{research}} {{has looked at}} the tinnitus distress reaction (TDR) to account for differences in tinnitus severity. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the limbic system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.|$|E
25|$|During the {{excavations}} {{conducted in}} the forest {{to the west of}} Allianoi, a vessel of the type known as Yortan (dating from the Early Bronze Age II) was found. On the hills of Çakmaktepe (Flint Hill) nearby, a high quantity of flintstones were found during surveys. Additionally, two stone axes were unearthed from an earth fill. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> some form of prehistoric settlement at or near Allianoi.|$|E
50|$|Remarkably, {{one-third of}} swingers flatly {{rejected}} the idea of changing their behaviors in response to HIV/AIDS. <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggest</b> people involved in open marriages may indeed be at somewhat greater risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.|$|R
30|$|Discussion: Essure 505 was {{successful}} at causing tubal occlusion within one hour post-placement {{as well as}} at 30, 60 and 90 days later. <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggest</b> next generation Essure 505 will provide immediate and long term tubal occlusion.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that S100A11 enhances the {{recombination}} activity of human RAD51 in vitro. A knock-down leads to diffuse distribution of RAD54B. [...] <b>These</b> <b>finding</b> <b>suggest</b> a potential role of S100A11 in the process of homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks.|$|R
25|$|Metabolites of {{ketamine}} including dehydronorketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and norketamine {{have been}} found to act as negative allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the KXa7R1 cell line (HEK293 cells transfected with rat nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes) with subanesthetic and nanomolar potencies (e.g., IC50 = 55nM for dehydronorketamine), whereas ketamine itself was inactive at the same concentrations (< 1nbsp&µM). <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that metabolites may contribute importantly to the pharmacodynamics of ketamine.|$|E
25|$|Researchers have {{hypothesized}} {{a number}} of factors that could be responsible for these differences between countries, including national differences in overall income levels, self-serving biases and self-enhancement, and approach and avoidance orientations. Taken together, <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that while extraversion-introversion does have a strong correlation with happiness, it does not stand alone as a sole predictor of subjective well-being, and that other factors must be accounted for when trying to determine the correlates of happiness.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine {{indirectly}} affects opioid receptors (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) {{as well as}} the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, and {{was shown}} to increase pain threshold in mice. When mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter (to measure pain), both venlafaxine and mirtazapine induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following intraperitoneal injection. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> venlafaxine's seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression as opioids become increasingly used as a measure of last resort for refractory cases.|$|E
30|$|Results: <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> a peritoneal {{spreading}} pattern due to morcellation. In {{order to}} avoid another spreading of fragmented myomas we converted to transverse Pfannenstiel laparotomy. All lesions were completely resected. Pathological examination demonstrated that these tumors were leiomyomas {{very similar to the}} myoma tissue excised earlier.|$|R
30|$|<b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} process {{involved}} in the genesis of hepatic failure in sepsis {{could be due to}} the cyclical repetition of the event: sinusoidal microcirculatory dysfunction - cytopathic hypoxia of the hepatocytes - edema of the columns of hepatocytes - compression of sinusoids - hepatic lobules dysfunction.|$|R
5000|$|Combination {{treatments}} {{consisting of}} DEC plus mebendezole, or ivermectin and albendazole, {{have been shown}} to result in a highly significant fall in microfilariae. [...] Other studies have challenged <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> <b>suggesting</b> the combination treatment of ivermectin and albendazole does not significantly reduce microfilariae levels more than a single treatment regimen.|$|R
25|$|In a 2011 {{meta-analysis}} of seven randomized trials that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from depression, peer support interventions {{were found to}} improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be {{comparable to those of}} group cognitive behavioral therapy. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.|$|E
25|$|A cyberpsychology {{research}} {{study conducted by}} Australian researchers demonstrated {{that a number of}} positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use. These researchers established that people can derive a sense of social connectedness and belongingness in the online environment. Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis use has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past few}} decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased. Together, <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who may already be predisposed to psychosis. High-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the onset of psychosis in predisposed patients. A 2012 study concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged.|$|E
40|$|A second {{trimester}} fetal demise followed {{influenza-like illness}} in early pregnancy. Influenza A virus (H 1 N 1) was identified in maternal and fetal tissue, confirming transplacental passage. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> a causal relationship between early exposure and fetal demise. Management of future influenza outbreaks should include evaluation of products of conception associated with fetal loss...|$|R
40|$|Using the Goldfeld and Quandt {{switching}} regression method, {{this paper}} investigates variability over 1975 - 85 {{in the risk}} components of bank and saving and loan stock. We develop evidence that the market-beta, interest-sensitivity, and residual risk of deposit-institution stock vary significantly during this period. Reassessing previous event studies in light of <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggests</b> that event-study methods tend to overreach their data. ...|$|R
40|$|A crude {{aqueous extract}} {{of the leaves}} of the guava tree, Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae), were studied for antidiarrhoeal effects, to place one of its {{traditional}} medical uses. The extract induced a decrease in the propulsive movements of the intestinal contents in mice. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> that an aqueous extract of guava leaves may be used as an effective treatment for non-specific diarrhoea in folk medicine...|$|R
25|$|Studies {{have also}} found that {{recognition}} memory involving epinephrine depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors. Epinephrine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that sotalol, a β adrenoceptor antagonist that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of peripherally administered epinephrine on memory. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that β adrenoceptors are necessary for epinephrine {{to have an effect}} on memory consolidation.|$|E
25|$|The {{cerebellum}} is {{the youngest}} brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. By contrast, all brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same epigenetic age in subjects who are younger than 80. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that the cerebellum is protected from aging effects, which in turn could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin at {{a dose of}} 25mg/day for 3weeks {{has been}} found to {{decrease}} cortisol levels by 16% in adults with chronic insomnia and to increase melatonin production by 26% in healthy volunteers. In individuals with neuroendocrine dysregulation in the form of nocturnal melatonin deficiency presumably due to chronic insomnia, very-low-dose doxepin was found to restore melatonin levels to near-normal values after 3weeks of treatment. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the circadian sleep–wake cycle may be involved in the beneficial effects of doxepin on sleep and insomnia.|$|E
50|$|Taken together, <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> also <b>suggest</b> that PPAP2B and LPA {{may serve}} {{a role in}} {{predicting}} and screening coronary artery disease for early prevention.|$|R
40|$|A 17 -year-old man {{presented}} with daytime sleepiness, episodic attacks {{of sleep and}} probable cataplexy. His EEG showed rapid eye movements and central sawtooth waves at sleep onset, and supported the clinical impression of narcolepsy. He improved with methylphenidate but died suddenly, and had cardiomegaly, right ventricular enlargement, and pulmonary hypertension at autopsy. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> concomitant features of sleep apnea which were not evident by history or examination...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that tricuspid regurgitation increases after conventional or physiological repair, in which the tricuspid valve is left in the systemic circulation, and tricuspid regurgitation decreases after procedures that increase LV pressure, such as pulmonary artery banding. The clinical significance of <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggests</b> that pulmonary artery banding may be effective as an isolated treatment for tricuspid regurgitation in patients with D-TGA after atrial switch repair and ccTGA [17].|$|R
25|$|Due {{to close}} {{proximity}} of the structures, vestibular lesioning often results in cochlear damage, which in turn results in hearing impairments. Hearing {{has been shown to}} affect place cell functioning, therefore, spatial deficits could be in part due to damage to the cochlea. However, animals with a removed eardrum (usually causing the inability to hear) and normal vestibular labyrinths perform significantly better than animals with eardrums and lesioning in the vestibular labyrinths. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that disruption to hearing is not the primary cause of the observed spatial memory deficits.|$|E
25|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disease that is characterized by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures. Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood–brain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures. Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein (albumin) and astrocytes. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti-epileptic drugs.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies of}} {{prepared}} learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males {{were far more}} difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), <b>these</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that outgroup males {{may have been more}} of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) mediates the {{production}} of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Pulmonary arterial cell cultures treated with fasudil showed a significant increase in eNOS mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner, and the half-life of eNOS mRNA increased 2-folds. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> that ROCK inhibition with fasudil increases eNOS expression by stabilizing eNOS mRNA, which contributed to an increase of NO level to enhance vasodilation.|$|R
30|$|A histopathological {{examination}} of the specimen from the right third finger showed cells with scanty cytoplasm and small round nuclei, proliferating in the trabecular and clumps with fibrosis. The nuclei were clear and pale with delicate chromatin. The tumor was immunohistochemically positive for neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin and CD 56), cytokeratin marker (CAM 5.2), and CK 20. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> that pathological diagnosis was MCC on the right third finger.|$|R
40|$|Sera from {{individuals}} vaccinated with a cholera toxoid were tested {{to determine if}} sera with significant titers of cholera antitoxin could neutralize Escherichia coli thermolabile enterotoxin. Individuals who responded to immunization with significant increases in serum cholera antitoxin titers also showed increases in serum E. coli enterotoxin-neutralizing capacity. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> {{the possibility that the}} cholera toxoid vaccine may be useful in preventing disease caused by E. coli...|$|R
