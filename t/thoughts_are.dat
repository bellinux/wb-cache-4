The game features 13 possible endings, one after each major boss fight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} logical <b>thought</b> has <b>been</b> {{discussed}} since time known to rational mind {{but the notion}} of illogical <b>thought</b> <b>be</b> possible <b>is</b> rarely <b>thought</b> and in this paper, there is an attempt made to understand the notion of illogical thought by asking whether illogical <b>thought</b> <b>be</b> possible or not, {{and if it is}} not, why it is not and if it is yes, then how can it be. The paper comprises of two parts i,e. (i) Illogical <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> impossible. Why it is so? – Early Wittgenstein’s reply and (ii) Illogical <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> possible. How can it be? -Criticism to Early Wittgenstein...|$|R

These do not exist for volcanoes in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada in the detail required.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of thought content would describe a patient's delusions, overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' thoughts in an open-ended conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the thoughts, {{the extent to which the}} <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

5|$|These <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> {{employed}} {{on various}} important situations and {{incidents in the}} ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject;… while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention {{of those who are}} more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.|$|E
5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

50|$|Exploratory <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> an {{academic}} term {{used in the}} field of psychology to describe reasoning that neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to, or flaws in, a particular position, with the goal of seeking truth. The opposite of exploratory <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> confirmatory <b>thought,</b> which <b>is</b> reasoning designed to construct justification supporting a specific point of view.|$|R
50|$|To analyse {{whether a}} {{relative}} clause is restrictive or non-restrictive a simple test can be applied: If the basic {{meaning of the}} sentence (the <b>thought)</b> <b>is</b> not changed by removing the relative clause, the relative clause is not essential to the basic <b>thought</b> and <b>is</b> non-restrictive. But if the essential meaning of the <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> disturbed, the relative clause is restrictive.|$|R

25|$|The {{historical}} {{impact of}} the six meditations has been divided. The first two meditations, which employed the skeptical methodic doubt and concluded that only the ego and its <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> indubitable, have had a huge impact {{in the history of}} philosophy. They are often considered as epoch-making for modernity, and an unavoidable first step for any modern philosophical thinking.|$|E

25|$|With {{evidence}} of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, {{a state of}} extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. <b>Thoughts</b> <b>are</b> mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.|$|E
30|$|Direct {{discourse}} {{is represented by}} a main clause that is intended to literally reproduce the context of thought, by reproducing what the protagonist said or thought. The context of utterance of a super-ordinate clause only serves to introduce the report as a ‘quote’, that is, to signal that the context of <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> {{not to be identified}} with the context of utterance (the time at which the speech or <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> interpreted is not the time at which the speech or <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> produced) and to signal that there is a second utterer besides the author in the context of <b>thought,</b> that <b>is,</b> a different experiencer that reproduces the original speech or thought at a different time.|$|R
