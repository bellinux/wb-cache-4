Perceptions of 39 practicing teachers who had recently graduated from the program revealed that electronic portfolios provided opportunities to learn about educational technology and were perceived as reflective of effort put forth during university training.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that the {{correlation}} smile in liquid CDS index tranches can be explained by the same ideas that have proven to explain the volatility smile in equity options. First, we extend a structural model proposed by Luciano and Schoutens [2005] that models firm values by Variance Gamma processes. We show that these extensions can explain the index spread curves and tranche quotes of DJ iTraxx 5 year simultaneously. Second, we extract the resulting dependence structure into a factor copula approach. The resulting VG copula shares the advantages of the well known Gaussian copula that underlies the most important industry models like CreditMetrics and KMV. We apply this approach to weekly spreads of DJ iTraxx 5 year. We show that this approach fits significantly better to the correlation smile than comparable copula approaches. 1 In the 1980 s, Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were introduced for balance sheet risk management.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether six broad {{categories}} <b>of</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> activities undertaken by academics: the creation and diffusion of knowledge through publications, transmission of knowledge through teaching, informal knowledge transfer, patenting, spin-off formation and consulting activities, are complementary, substitute, or independent, as well as the conditions under which complementarities, substitution and independence among these activities are likely to emerge. This investigation relied on data regarding 1554 researchers funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. Contrary to prior studies which have examined complementarities and the determinants <b>of</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> activities in separate models, this study relied on a multivariate path model to reflect the fact that in practice, academics consider simultaneously whether or not to undertake multiple knowledge transfer activities. Overall, the results point to the existence of three very different types <b>of</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> activities: a first <b>portfolio</b> made up <b>of</b> complementary activities which are interdependent and reinforce each other. This portfolio includes publications, patenting, spin-off creation, consulting and informal knowledge transfer.

40|$|Vectors {{based on}} the adeno-associated virus (AAV) are {{attractive}} and versatile vehicles for in vivo gene transfer. The virus capsid is the primary interface with the cell that defines many pharmacological, immunological and molecular properties. Determinants of these interactions are often restricted to {{a limited number of}} capsid amino acids. In this study, a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> novel AAV vectors was developed after a structure-function analysis of naturally occurring AAV capsid isolates. Singletons, which are particular residues on the AAV capsid that were variable in otherwise conserved amino acid positions, were found to impact on vector's ability to be manufactured or to transduce. Data for those residues that mapped to monomer-monomer interface regions on the particle structure suggested a role in particle assembly. The change of singleton residues to the conserved amino acid resulted in the rescue of many isolates that were defective on initial isolation. This {{led to the development of}} an AAV vector portfolio that encompasses six different clades and 3 other distinct AAV niches.

In South African {{classrooms}} {{a strong}} {{emphasis is placed on}} assessing learners by means <b>of</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Through the utilisation <b>of</b> <b>portfolios</b> it is envisaged that learner growth and development should be enhanced in order for learners to become expert learners who are strategic, self-regulated and self-reflecting. This study aimed to determine how effective the implementation <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment presently is, and if necessary, to develop a model that could improve the implementation <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment in the Senior Phase, Grade 9 in particular. By means of explanatory mixed method research through the completion of questionnaires by 369 learners and 88 educators, and focus group interviews conducted with 36 of the 88 educators from the Sedibeng West District, disconcerting results were revealed. It appeared that educators are not equipped with adequate knowledge and skills to implement portfolio assessment in order to enhance learner growth and development. Based on the disturbing findings, a model was designed to highlight the processes and components involved in the successful implementation <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> assessment.

This research is also aimed to know about the contribution of each defrayal variable at Syariah Mandiri Bank, Inc. The analysis tools that were used in this research are by using Markowitz Model. To determine the optimal portfolio is by determining the composition <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> as much as 20 combinations.
