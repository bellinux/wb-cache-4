5|$|In his 1998 {{autobiography}} For the Love of the Game, Jordan {{wrote that}} he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. The added exhaustion due to <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> run in the 1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{announcement of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> was announced on December 8, 2016. It {{was revealed that}} this will be the highlight of the season, and {{that this will be}} composed of the lucky finalists of each edition. <b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> Edition officially began on January 7, 2017. With 9 lucky housemates securing a spot on <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team,</b> 3 more housemates are to be handpicked by Big Brother to complete the roster of housemates. This makes 12 housemates for <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team.</b> At {{the end of the first}} week, celebrity housemate Elisse Joson became the 4th Lucky Star, as well as teen housemate Yong Muhajil for the 4th Lucky Sun, and regular adult housemate Cora Waddell for the 4th Lucky House.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> {{averaged}} 117.3 {{points and}} won its games {{by an average}} of 43.8 points.

However, the level of international competition improved since 1992. The 2012 team faced a tougher opponent in Spain, which had seven NBA players; Croatia in 1992 had only two NBA players at that point. Overall, the 2012 Olympic field had 39 NBA players and 18 former NBA players were on team rosters, while rosters in 1992 had 17 NBA players and three other former players—more than half of those NBA players were on <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team.</b>|$|E
25|$|While in college, O'Neal was {{considered}} for <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> {{to fill the}} college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner. His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship {{in which he was}} named MVP of the Tournament. While he led <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.|$|E

25|$|In the offseason, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen {{played for}} <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, winning the gold medal.

25|$|Santana and Valentine went on {{to wrestle}} a memorable series of singles and tag team matches with neither gaining the upper hand. They {{wrestled}} {{in a variety of}} different types of matches such as regular title matches, no disqualification matches, and Lumberjack matches. The pair also faced off in tag team competition with Santana teaming with the Junkyard Dog and Valentine teaming with Brutus Beefcake in a team that would become known as <b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team.</b>|$|E
25|$|Towards late 1994 and {{especially}} in 1995 there was a definite distinction between the reggae and ragga sounding jungle and the tracks with heavily edited breaks, such as the artists Remarc, DJ Dextrous and <b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> on Suburban Bass Records. Ironically, one compilation which brought the term to the wider awareness of those outside the scene, 'Drum & Bass Selection vol 1' (1994), featured {{a large amount of}} ragga influenced tracks, and the first big track to use the term in its title (Remarc's 'Drum & Bass Wize', 1994) was also ragga-influenced.|$|E
25|$|He {{was one of}} {{two players}} (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He {{averaged}} 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.|$|E
50|$|Professional wrestler Danshoku Dino {{wrestled}} as Ishida Mitsunari for <b>the</b> Dramatic <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> promotion on February 10, 2013.|$|R
50|$|He {{was awarded}} the player of the series in the 1988 Panasonic Cup while playing with the St. George Dragons and in 1996 he was named in <b>the</b> Super League <b>Dream</b> <b>Team.</b> In 1997 he was again named in <b>the</b> Super League <b>Dream</b> <b>Team.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lapenda {{also created}} <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>Dream</b> <b>Team,</b> {{which was to}} have all the major Brazilian fighters {{training}} together in Luta Livre, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, and muay Thai under Carlson Gracie. Lapenda actually opened an academy in Los Angeles in 1995 near UCLA in Westwood, California, for Carlson Gracie and Vitor Belfort to teach at. <b>The</b> Brazilian <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> eventually became <b>the</b> Brazilian Top Team and was composed of those same people Lapenda brought together under Carlson to cross-train.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> played {{attractive}} football {{that was}} {{comparable to the}} 1970s Ajax team, and won four consecutive La Liga championships from 1991 to 1994, {{as well as the}} 1991–92 European Cup, along with the 1992 UEFA Super Cup, 1989–90 Copa del Rey and 1991 and 1992 Supercopa de España titles. Laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in Spain during his Barcelona years. When Barça hired a fourth foreign star player, Brazilian striker Romário in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 European Cup final 0–4 loss to Milan (amid conflicts with Cruyff), his time at Barcelona was effectively over.|$|E
25|$|For {{the fourth}} post-independence Olympics, {{basketball}} captain Saulius Štombergas {{was given the}} honor to bear the Lithuanian flag during the opening ceremony. The Olympic basketball for Lithuania started slowly, laboring to a victory against the African champions Angola 78–63, with their opponents shooting an excellent 52% from the three-point line. Lithuanian national team also had difficulties with Puerto Rico, depending on a high average of three-pointers to beat the NBA-heavy squad by 98–90. Then Lithuanians, in front of 12,000 spectators, achieved revenge against their Greek hosts, defeating them 98–76. The next match would be against the United States, which again featured major NBA stars such as Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan, and LeBron James, but had already been proven as faltering following a defeat to Puerto Rico. Lithuania managed to beat the United States 94–90, only the fourth defeat by the Americans in the Olympic stage. Jasikevičius, who had lost a possible buzzer beater against <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team</b> four years before, managed to score 28 points, including a decisive 10-point barrage in 69 seconds that gave Lithuania {{the lead in the}} final minutes. While the fifth game, versus Australia, was not significant for the group standings as the Lithuanians had already secured the first spot in the group, the Lithuanians still won 100–85, maintaining their good run.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, the team's successes {{continued}} as usual. Led by José Ortiz, Ramón Rivas, Jerome Mincy, Fico López, and Edgar León. the decade {{began with a}} 4th-place finish at the 1990 World Championship in Argentina. This is Puerto Rico's best showing at a World Championship so far, defeating teams such as Yugoslavia, Argentina and the USA, but losing to the USSR and then, losing by two points the rematch in overtime to the USA. In 1991, led by Raymond Gause, besides earning gold at the CentroBasket tournament, the team also won, {{for the first time}} in basketball, the gold medal at the Pan American Games, which were held in Cuba. The team also qualified for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, where it reached the second round, unluckily having to face, in its first game of the elimination round, a United States National team composed of NBA players (<b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>Team),</b> finishing at the end in 8th place.In 1993, Puerto Rico signed its Caribbean supremacy at this sport by winning gold at both the CentroBasket and the Central American and Caribbean Games. This victory at CentroBasket was the last of a 5 gold medal streak at the tournament. In 1994, the team finished in a 6th place at the World Championship in Canada, but won the gold at the 1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, defeating teams such as Croatia, Russia, Brazil and Italy. It was then when Puerto Rico began to be classified as one of the top 10 international teams. Having won gold in 1995 at the FIBA Americas Pre-Olympic Championship, in 1996 at the Olympics Games, the team placed 10th in Atlanta, while in 1998, it placed 11th at the World Championship in Greece.|$|E
