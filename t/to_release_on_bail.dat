50|$|As to the {{question}} of whether a High Court has inherent power to grant bail, or whether bail release powers are only to be found explicitly in statute, earlier cases inclined to the view that a High Court did not have inherent power <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>on</b> <b>bail</b> if a statute law did not give it express power. More recently the courts have inclined to the view that they do have an inherent, common-law power to release a person on bail even if there is no statutory provision permitting it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an argument for}} the abolition of police bail without charge. The police have extensive powers <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>on</b> <b>bail</b> a person who they have arrested, without charging them with an offence. Moreover, they have extensive powers to attach conditions to that bail. There is no time limit on the period for which a person can be bailed, and little judicial oversight. These powers can have severe detrimental effects on persons bailed, and yet are almost unenforceable - {{and there is little}} or no evidence of their efficacy. The paper argues that government plans to regulate police bail are unlikely to be effective, that powers to impose conditions should be abolished, and that bail without charge should be limited to 14 days...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{the power}} of the police to release a person on bail prior to trial has existed for centuries, the power <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>on</b> <b>bail</b> a person {{suspected}} of but not charged with a criminal offence has been available to the police only since 1925. The power to attach conditions to pre-charge bail is of very recent origin, having been introduced {{for the first time in}} 2003 but rapidly expanded since then. Whilst imposing restrictions on the liberty of a person should, constitutionally, be reserved to the judiciary, the fact that it was originally conceived, in part at least, as a mechanism for enhancing liberty reduced the constitutional tension created by allowing members of the executive such powers. However, the changing role of arrest in the investigation of crime and the granting of extensive powers to the police to impose bail conditions means that the police now have the ability to place controls on people not charged with a criminal offence for extended periods of time. It is argued here that this is in breach of the right to liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights and, in practice, may also breach other Convention rights...|$|E
