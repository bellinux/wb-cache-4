500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

60|$|The air hit me on {{the chest}} so that I gasped. I dropped the glass screw. I cried out, put my hands <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> and sat down. For a time I was in pain. Then I took deep breaths. At last I could rise and move about again.|$|E
60|$|As I started <b>to</b> obey, <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> {{swelling}} {{with pride}} in my mission, Jed Dunham cried {{out that he}} wanted to go with me. Jed was about my own age.|$|R
60|$|I had instinctively {{taken off}} my round felt {{hat in the}} first moment of surprise, when I found myself {{in the midst of}} this strange throng, and I {{standing}} now in a somewhat embarrassed posture, holding it awkwardly before me like a shield <b>to</b> protect <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ow {{can you be}} distantly civil {{when she}} lives just opposite?" [...] inquired the steward, querulously. [...] "She sent Teddy over at ten o'clock last night <b>to</b> rub <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> with a bottle o' liniment, and it's no good me saying I'm all right when she's been {{spending}} eighteen-pence o' good money over the stuff." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, I shall drop far. They have cunning {{tables of}} calculations, like {{interest}} tables, {{that show the}} distance of the drop in relation to the victim's weight. I am so emaciated that they will have to drop me far in order to break my neck. And then the onlookers will take their hats off, and as I swing the doctors will press their ears <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> to count my fading heart-beats, and at last they will say that I am dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} dark on the quarter-deck of the Ferndale between the deep bulwarks {{overshadowed by the}} break of the poop and frowned upon by {{the front of the}} warehouse. I plumped down on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> near the after hatch as if my legs had been jerked from under me. I felt {{suddenly}} very tired and languid. The ship-keeper, whom I could hardly make out hung over the capstan in a fit of weak pitiful coughing. He gasped out very low `Oh! dear! Oh! dear!' and struggled for breath so long that I got up alarmed and irresolute.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a funny}} thing, this hanging of a man. I {{have never}} seen a hanging, but I have been told by eye-witnesses the details of a dozen hangings so that I know what will happen to me. Standing on the trap, leg-manacled and arm-manacled, the knot against the neck, the black cap drawn, they will drop me down until the {{momentum}} of my descending weight is fetched up abruptly short by the tautening of the rope. Then the doctors will group around me, and one will relieve another in successive turns in standing on a stool, his arms passed around me to keep me from swinging like a pendulum, his ear pressed close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> while he counts my fading heart-beats. Sometimes twenty minutes elapse after the trap is sprung ere the heart stops beating. Oh, trust me, they make most scientifically sure that a man is dead once they get him on a rope.|$|E
60|$|The next day, on {{my return}} from a long walk, I found, as I entered my bedroom, an {{unexpected}} change. In, addition <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own French bed in its shady recess, appeared in a corner a small crib, draped with white; and in addition <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mahogany <b>chest</b> of drawers, I saw a tiny rosewood chest. I stood still, gazed, and considered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doctor," [...] he said, [...] "I happen <b>to</b> have <b>my</b> {{chemical}} <b>chest</b> with me, {{and some}} special testing tubes. If you'll allow me, I'd like {{to examine this}} cup of bouillon. You might come round, too, if you will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would like <b>to</b> see <b>my</b> casts and antiquities," [...] said Hans, after the first hearty {{greetings}} and inquiries, [...] "so I didn't scruple <b>to</b> unlade <b>my</b> <b>chests</b> here. But I've found two rooms at Chelsea not many hundred yards from my mother and sisters, and I shall soon be ready to hang out there--when they've scraped the walls and put in some new lights. That's all I'm waiting for. But you see I don't wait to begin work: you can't conceive what a great fellow I'm going to be. The seed of immortality has sprouted within me." ...|$|R
60|$|Struck dumb {{with these}} reflections, I rose up in a pensive manner, being so {{thoughtful}} that I {{could not go}} to sleep; and fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it caused me to remember, that the Brazilians use tobacco for almost all diseases. I then went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> in older to find some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me {{to find a cure}} for both soul and body; for there I found one of the Bibles, which, till this time, I had neither leisure nor inclination to look into, I took both the tobacco and that out of the chest, and laid them on the table. Several experiments did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece or leaf, and chewed it; but it being very green and strong, almost stupified me. Next I steeped it in some rum an hour or two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dole of it: and, in the third place, I burnt some over a pan of fire, holding my nose over it as long as I could endure it without suffocation.|$|E

The song was rumored to be a leftover cut from her Teenage Dream recording sessions, and fans speculated that the track might be included in an as-yet-unconfirmed re-release of the LP. This re-release was confirmed in January 2012, when Perry announced through her official website that the album would contain all twelve songs from the original album, plus three new songs and a remix, and would be released on March 26, 2012. Perry's press release stated: [...] "This is the complete story of Teenage Dream.

50|$|In an {{interview}} with HipHopDX, Krayzie Bone spoke {{on the creation of}} the album: I’d have to say that was the easiest album to make because I had so much material and so much stuff backed up.

A lot of those tracks, I had the ideas first and then I went in and laid them straight out. Some of the stuff was from what we didn’t use from Art Of War. On Art Of War, I would basically start the songs off and everyone else would just come in and do what they do. What dudes didn’t use, I just kept stashed away and when it was time work on my album, I just brought them out.|$|R

[...] "What good after all have I done," [...] thought I to myself, [...] "in this expedition which I had so rashly undertaken?" [...] I had seen the renowned Holkar, I had been in the heart of his camp; I knew the disposition of his troops, that there were eleven thousand of them, and that he only waited for his guns to make a regular attack on the fort. I had seen Puttee Rooge; I had robbed her (I say ROBBED her, and I don't care what the reader or any other man may think of the act) of a deal box, containing jewels to the amount of three millions sterling, the property of herself and husband.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a pretty}} country {{simplicity}} in this that made some laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion.

At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate.
