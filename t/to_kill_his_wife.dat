Set in Texas, the film tells {{the tale of a}} shifty, sleazy bar owner who hires a private detective <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and her lover.

The film starred Frances McDormand, who would go on to feature in many of the Coen brothers' films (and marry Joel). Upon release the film received much praise and won awards for Joel's direction at both the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards.|$|E

Melville's naval career prospered, and he eventually achieved the rank of rear admiral. He died in 1912. [...] Danenhower continued in the navy, but shot himself during a fit of depression in 1887.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was generally negative. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with a C-, explaining he didn't {{want to watch}} a season one cast-off, {{and that some of}} the episode moments were [...] "generic embarrassing", such as when Olivia tricked someone into telling her Rusk was sick and when Rusk failed <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> after falling into the [...] "old Fallacy Of The Talking Killer" [...] cliche. New Yorks Tim Grierson thought it was [...] "the lamest in recent memory" [...] and [...] "a stinker that should have remained safely out of public view". He did however remark that the episode allowed him to see how far the show had improved since its first season. In a slightly more positive review, MTV's Josh Wigler wrote [...] "As far as standard installments of Fringe go, 'Unearthed' ranks somewhere {{in the middle of the}} pack, but the quality diminishes due to its awkward placement in the middle of season two". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 6.4/10, commenting that it was [...] "cheesy, with mediocre writing and some fairly bad performances from the guest supporting cast". Isler found little to redeem the episode, and wished the story's partial focus on the intersection of science and faith had been further explored.|$|E

In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon Bruno the Kid which featured a CGI representation of himself.

He went on to play the lead roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Fifth Element (1997). However, {{by the end of}} the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like The Jackal, Mercury Rising, and Breakfast of Champions, saved only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed Armageddon which was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide. The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game Apocalypse. In 1999, Willis then went on to the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Sixth Sense.
