5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police to enforce the laws, {{even if they did}} not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|On Shepard's second cruise with Cogswell, he was {{appointed}} a gunnery officer, responsible for the 20mm and 40mm antiaircraft guns on the ship's bow. They engaged kamikazes in the Battle of Okinawa, where the ship served in the dangerous role of a radar picket. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radar pickets was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes; but because they were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. Cogswell performed this duty from May 27, 1945, until June 26, when it rejoined Task Force 38. The ship also participated in the Allied naval bombardments of Japan, and was present in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender of Japan in September 1945. Shepard returned to the United States later that month.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} the kick through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed {{because of the lack of}} an offside rule. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal and wait for a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs. Despite their name their job was to man mark the kick through.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{technology}} was not flawless. It struggled to gauge heights of incoming formations above 25,000 feet {{and could not}} measure their numerical strength. It could also take several minutes to assess the line of advance for aircraft on a zigzag course. Moreover, the radar looked out to sea {{and was unable to}} track aircraft overland. That was <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Observer Corps. Tens of thousands of volunteers, the length and breadth of Britain tracked the German formations over land. They were connected to Sector airfields by landline and could communicate intelligence in real time.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Ganguly {{was removed}} from the {{captaincy}} of the KKR for the 2009 season of the IPL, and was replaced by McCullum. The decision was questioned by media and other players of the team, when KKR finished {{at the bottom of the}} ranking table with three wins and ten losses. After that, Bengali television channel Zee Bangla roped him as the host of the reality quiz show titled Dadagiri Unlimited. It presented participants from the 19districts of West Bengal, who had to answer questions posed by Ganguly. By August, he was appointed the chairman of CAB's Cricket Development Committee. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> committee is to receive a report from the selectors at the end of every cricket season, assess the accountability of the selectors and make necessary recommendations. He played for the Ranji cup in the Bengal team in October 2009. Ganguly scored 110 in the match against Delhi and was involved in a partnership of 222 runs with Wriddhiman Saha.|$|E

5|$|MT 87 {{begins at}} the MontanaIdaho state line, {{traveling}} through Raynolds Pass. The highway proceeds northward, intersecting a small road before entering rural areas within Gallatin National Forest. The route continues northeast, intersecting several forest roads before bending northwestward. The route intersects several small roads while it runs parallel to a small creek. It crosses over the Madison River after passing several small buildings. The highway continues northwestward to its northern terminus, an at-grade intersection with US 287. The highway is maintained by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT). Part of <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MDT is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles that travel along {{a portion of the}} highway. In 2011, the highway had an AADT count of 583 vehicles. No portion of the highway is listed as part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{potential}} of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the Victorian era was largely <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already very detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. James's education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a sixteen-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man John hired to instruct his son, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. John dismissed the tutor in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, sent James to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.|$|E
