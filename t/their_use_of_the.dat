5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, {{to the extent that}} late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E
5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magic Wand to create vibrations {{in the left}} biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper {{published in the journal}} Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRoad {{network system}} is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} infrastructures {{in any country}} as it provides the means to move people and goods. Inefficient road network system will disrupt the transportation movement, environment and affect human movement. This paper examines the structure and patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road network system in Port Klang, Malaysia. It found that after implementation of toll on highways, heavy lorries decreased <b>their</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tolled highway, and started using regular roads.

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Literary Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized {{the first floor of}} the building as a meeting space, while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of dormancy, the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star, which was organized in July 1919, utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney Literary Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary Hall from the Clinton Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase of Literary Hall, Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E
5|$|The Grimaldi's {{occupation}} of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, {{the absence of}} alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted in <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same residence {{for more than seven}} centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected {{in the evolution of the}} palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian Baroque style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style {{had been used}} on the island in a naïve and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E

5|$|The direct {{participation}} of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited. In practice, <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister {{the person who is}} the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus {{one of the most powerful}} institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.|$|E

The family's rocketship has set {{down in a}} frozen region of a planet, where Dengo meets with members of The Last Revolution, a radical anti-war group, who wish to use Hazel as a pawn in their {{campaign}} against Landfall and Wreath. Meanwhile, as Marko and Prince Robot IV struggle to maintain their alliance while in pursuit of their kidnapped loved ones, Alana and Yuma both deal {{with the consequences of}} <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug Fadeway. By the end of the arc, Dengo has turned on the revolutionaries, but is himself killed by Prince Robot IV, who is united with his son. Marko and Alana are reunited, but Hazel and Klara are relegated to a Landfallian prison. The Brand, Gwendolyn and Sophie have acquired the elixir, but the Brand is killed in the process.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
