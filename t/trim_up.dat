6000|$|... 2. Well, notice {{being taken}} that {{a motion to}} sin is present, what follows but that the fancy or {{imagination}} of the soul taketh it home to it, and doth not only look upon it and behold it more narrowly, but begins to trick and <b>trim</b> <b>up</b> the sin to the pleasing of itself {{and of all the}} powers of the soul. That this is true, is evident, because God findeth fault with the imagination as with that which lendeth to sin the first hand, and that giveth to it the first lift towards its being helped forward to act. 'And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth' (Gen 6:5,12,13). That is, many abominable actions were done; for all flesh had corrupted God's way upon the earth. But how came this to be so? Why, every imagination of the thoughts, or of the motions that were in the heart to sin, was evil, only evil, and that continuously. The imagination of the thoughts was evil--that is, such as tended not to deaden or stifle, but such as tended to animate and forward the motions or thoughts of sin into action. Every imagination of the thoughts--that which is here called a thought, by Paul to the Romans, called a motion. Now the imagination should, and would, had it been on God's side, so have conceived of this motion of and to sins, all to have presented it in all its features so ugly, so ill favoured, and so unreasonable a thing to the soul, that the soul should forthwith have let down the sluice, and pulled up the drawbridge, put a stop, with greatest defiance, to the motion now under consideration; but the imagination being defiled, it presently, at the very first view or noise of the motion of sin, so acted as to forward the bringing the said motion or thought into act. So, then, the thought of sin, or motion thereto, is first of all entertained by the imagination and fancy of the soul, and thence conveyed {{to the rest of the}} powers of the soul to be condemned, if the imagination be good; but to be helped forward to the act, if the imagination be evil. And thus the evil imagination helpeth the motion of and to sin towards the act, even by dressing of it up in that guise and habit that may best delude the understanding, judgment, and conscience; and that is done after this manner: suppose a motion of sin to commit fornication, to swear, to steal, to act covetously, or the like, be propounded to the fancy and imagination; the imagination, if evil, presently dresseth up this motion in that garb that best suiteth with the nature of the sin. As, if it be the lust of uncleanness, then is the motion to sin drest up in all the imaginable pleasurableness of that sin; if to covetousness, then is the sin drest up in the profits and honours that attend that sin; and so of theft and the like; but if the motion be to swear, hector, or the like, then is that motion drest up with valour and manliness; and so you may count of the rest of sinful motions; and thus being trimmed up like a Bartholomew baby, 25 it is presented to all the rest of the powers of the soul, where with joint consent it is admired and embraced, to the firing and inflaming all the powers of the soul.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} controls, {{in normal}} law vertical side stick movement {{corresponds to a}} load factor proportional to stick deflection independent of aircraft speed. When the stick is neutral and the load factor is 1g, the aircraft remains in level flight without the pilot changing the elevator trim. Horizontal side stick movement commands a roll rate, and the aircraft maintains a proper pitch angle once a turn has been established, up to 33¬∞ bank.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of a 1 / 20 -scale dynamically similar model of the Boeing Stratocruiser airplane (C- 97) was made to determine the ditching characteristics and proper technique for ditching the airplane. Scale-strength bottoms {{were used to determine}} probable damage to the fuselage and the effect of damage on behavior. The behavior of the model was determined from visual observations, motion-picture records, and time-history deceleration records. Data are presented in a table, photographs, and curves. It was concluded that the airplane should be ditched at a medium nose-high landing attitude (near 6 deg) with landing flaps full down. The airplane will probably make a smooth run of medium depth with light spray and may even <b>trim</b> <b>up</b> slightly in the water. The fuselage will probably be damaged and the lower compartment filled with water. In calm water, the maximum longitudinal deceleration will be about 4 g and the landing run will be about four fuselage lengths...|$|E

40|$|Tests of a 1 / 20 -scale {{dynamically}} similar {{model of}} the Northrop B- 35 airplane were made to study its ditching characteristics. The model was ditched in calm water at the Langley tank no. 2 monorail. Various landing attitudes, speeds,and conditions of damage were simulated during the investigation. The ditching characteristics were determined by visual observation and from motion-picture records and time-history acceleration records. Both longitudinal and lateral accelerations were measured. Results are given in tabular form and time-history acceleration curves and sequence photographs are presented. Conclusions based on the model investigation are as follows: 1. The best ditching of the B- 35 airplane probably {{can be made by}} contacting the water in a near normal landing attitude of about 9 deg with the landing flaps full down so as to have a low horizontal speed. 2. The airplane usually will turn or yaw but the motion will not be violent. The maximum lateral acceleration will be about 2 g. 3. If the airplane does not turn or yaw immediately after landing, it probably will <b>trim</b> <b>up</b> and then make a smooth run or porpoise slightly. The maximum longitudinal decelerations that will be encountered are about 6 g or 7 g. 4. Although the decelerations are not indicated to be especially large, the construction of the airplane is such that extensive damage is to be expected, and it probably will be difficult to find ditching stations where crew members can adequately brace themselves and be reasonably sure of avoiding a large inrush of water...|$|E
