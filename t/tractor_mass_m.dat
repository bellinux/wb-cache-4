The rotational equation can calculate the rotation period for a star of <b>mass</b> (<b>M),</b> which is circled by another <b>mass</b> (<b>m).</b> Of the nine planets that orbit our sun, we can calculate the their rotation period about our Sun. Also, from the rotation equation, we can calculate the rotation period of Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto because all these planets are circled by other moons with a small <b>mass</b> (<b>m).</b> The rotation period of the large body is highly effected by the inclination degree of the small body orbit...|$|R

40|$|This experiment, {{sometimes}} called a horizontal Atwood's machine, involves acceleration {{of an air}} track glider by a small mass attached to the glider by a string passing over a pulley. The gravitational force on the small hanging mass provides the force to accelerate the glider, as seen using the free body diagram of Figure 1, giving the equations: [Equation] where T is {{the tension in the}} string, <b>M</b> is the <b>mass</b> of the glider, <b>m</b> is the <b>mass</b> of the small hanging mass, a is the acceleration of the system, and g is the acceleration of gravity. The acceleration a of the system can then be obtained by eliminating T : [Equation] Like the standard Atwood's machine, the system thus moves with a constant acceleration. The acceleration of the system can be determined experimentally using the difference method of Demonstration 01 - 10. Three cases are shown in the video: (1) glider <b>mass</b> <b>M</b> with accelerating <b>mass</b> <b>m.</b> (2) glider <b>mass</b> <b>M</b> with accelerating <b>mass</b> 2 <b>m.</b> (3) glider <b>mass</b> 2 <b>M</b> with accelerating <b>mass</b> <b>m.</b> If m so, to a good approximation, relative to the original case (1) the acceleration will double for case (2) and halve for case (3).

40|$|Machine {{vibration}} {{occurs as}} a result of unbalanced revolving masses, loading forces and moments, starting and coasting of driving motors and other effects. We try to eliminate these undesirable vibrations by suitable mounting of the mechanical system. Another possibility of suppression of the vibration machine is to use an absorber. A model of a vibration mechanical system with a vibration absorber is presented in the paper. The model consists of a fixed-end vibrating beam with primary vibrating <b>mass</b> <b>M</b> and with stiffness K and damping B. The harmonic force F with frequency ω and amplitude A acts on the primary <b>mass</b> <b>M</b> {{as well as on the}} beam with stiffness k and damping b, where the secondary <b>mass</b> <b>m</b> of the absorber is mounted. The task of the absorber is to minimize the movement of the <b>mass</b> <b>M.</b> A model (Fig. 1) has two degrees of freedom X and x. Two equations describe the movement of the primary <b>mass</b> <b>M</b> and the secondary <b>mass</b> <b>m</b> of the absorber. The model is solved first numerically by using Simulink. In numerical solution it is possible to set up parameters of the mechanical system with respect to the vibration reduction. According to the mechanical requirements for the mechanical system (output trajectory, velocity, forces and torques acting on the individual parts of the system), it is also possible to design input parameters (driving torques and other parameters of the mechanical system). A experimental model will be designed in order to verify results, where a voice-coil will be used as the actuator of the force F. Numerical and experimental model allows changing parameters i. e. <b>masses</b> <b>M</b> and m, length L an...|$|R
