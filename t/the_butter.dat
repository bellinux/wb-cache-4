5|$|A second market cross, {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Butter</b> Cross, {{which was built}} in the 15th century used to stand near the Yarn Market but was moved to the {{outskirts}} of the village in the 18th or 19th centuries. The Yarn Market is in the guardianship of English Heritage but is managed by the National Trust. In 1951 the Ministry of Works took over various properties including the Yarn Market from the Crown Estate. They carried out restoration works, however this was controversial as the shape of the roof was changed to more closely resemble the appearance of the original building, rather than that produced by subsequent revisions.|$|E

5|$|The name Buttercross {{originates}} {{from their}} location in market places, where people from neighbouring villages would gather around the market cross to buy locally produced products.

The Dunster Butter Cross was erected in the late 14th or early 15th century and originally stood in the High Street, possibly {{at the southern end of}} the high street, near the Yarn Market. A cross, which was later known as the high cross, was recorded in 1461; by 1689 it was known as <b>the</b> <b>Butter</b> Cross.|$|E

5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> industry.|$|E

25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into <b>the</b> <b>butter.</b> The tiny bubbles locked within <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in <b>the</b> <b>butter.</b> Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E

5000|$|Humorous {{observations}} {{have been}} made about buttered toast. It has been noted that buttered toast has a perceived tendency, when dropped, to land with <b>the</b> <b>buttered</b> side to <b>the</b> floor, the least desirable outcome. Although the concept of [...] "dropped buttered toast" [...] was originally a pessimistic joke, a 2001 study of <b>the</b> <b>buttered</b> toast phenomenon found that when dropped from a table, a buttered slice of toast landed butter-side down at least 62% of the time. The phenomenon is widely believed to be attributable to {{the combination of the}} size of the toast and the height of the typical dining table, which means that the toast will not rotate far enough to right itself before encountering the floor. A joke that plays on this tendency is <b>the</b> <b>buttered</b> cat paradox; if cats always land on their feet and buttered toast always lands buttered side down, it questions what happens when buttered toast is attached to a cat's back.|$|R

25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of butter was made by hand, on farms. The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal cream separator was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval. This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> produced in the United States was factory made; Europe followed suit shortly after.|$|E
