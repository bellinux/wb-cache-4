5|$|Murray {{defeated}} Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to win {{his second}} Queen's Club title. At Wimbledon, Murray lost in the semifinal to Nadal, despite <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> set. At the Davis Cup tie between Great Britain and Luxembourg, Murray led the British team to victory. Murray was the two-time defending 2011 Rogers Cup champion, but lost {{in the second round}} to South African Kevin Anderson. However, the following week, he won the 2011 Western & Southern Open after Novak Djokovic retired due to injury.

5|$|The 2011 French Open Men's singles {{semifinal}} between world No. 2 Novak Djokovic {{and world}} No. 3 Roger Federer was a historic encounter that {{brought about the}} end of the longest winning streak in almost 30 years. Djokovic entered the match undefeated for the first five months of the year having gone 41–0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches (his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals). It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer. Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011, however, Federer shocked many by <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two sets. Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was clear that if the match went to a fifth set it would have to be continued the next day. Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5–4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to visit Jupiter was Pioneer 10 in 1973, followed {{a year later}} by Pioneer11. Aside from <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> close-up pictures of the planet, the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior. The Voyager1 and Voyager2 probes visited the planet in 1979, and studied its moons and the ring system, discovering the volcanic activity ofIo {{and the presence of}} water ice on the surface of Europa. Ulysses further studied Jupiter's magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000. The Cassini probe approached the planet in 2000 and took very detailed images of its atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft passed by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its and its satellites' parameters.|$|E

Hamann stepped up first and scored high to the right of Hislop. Zamora took the first penalty for West Ham, but his shot was saved by Reina. Hyypiä took the next penalty for Liverpool, but he also missed, as Hislop saved his shot. Substitute Sheringham took West Ham's next penalty and scored, his shot beating Reina high to his left to level the shoot-out at 1–1. Liverpool captain Gerrard took their next penalty and scored to make it 2–1, while Konchesky's shot was saved by Reina. Riise took the next penalty for Liverpool and scored to extend their lead to 3–1.

5|$|Murray {{began his}} 2013 season by {{retaining}} his Brisbane International title, defeating Grigor Dimitrov {{in the final}} in straight sets. Trying to win his second Major in a row, he began the 2013 Australian Open well with a straight sets victory over Dutchman Robin Haase. He followed this up with straight set victories over João Sousa, practice partner Ričardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past Jérémy Chardy in straight sets {{to set up a}} semifinal clash with Roger Federer. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant quartet of the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against Djokovic. After <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> position and he emerged in second place.|$|E
