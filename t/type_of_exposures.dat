40|$|The {{credit risk}} that an {{individual}} bank poses {{to the rest of}} the financial system depends on its size, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> it has to the real economy, and its obligations to other institutions. This paper describes a system-wide risk management approach to calibrating individual banks ’ capital requirements that takes into account these factors and which correspond to a policymaker’s chosen target for systemic credit risk. The optimisation strategy identifies the minimum level of aggregate capital for the system and its distribution across banks that are consistent with a chosen objective for systemic credit risk. This parameterises a trade-off between efficiency and stability.

The main {{findings of this study}} are: the payments system network is strongly connected in contrast to the interbank exposures network; the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> and payment size reveal different roles played by banks; behavior of banks in the exposures network changed considerably after Lehmans failure; interconnectedness of a bank, estimated by the unified measure, is not necessarily related with its assets size...|$|E
40|$|Public and {{occupational}} exposures to microwave (RF) are of two main types. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> are those connected with military and industrial uses and, {{to some extent}} broadcast exposures. It is this type {{that most of the}} data cited in this study draw upon. The second type, cellular telephones and their associated broadcast requirements, have raised concerns about current exposures because of their increasingly widespread use. Four types of effects were originally reported in multiple studies: increased spontaneous abortion, shifts in red and white blood cell counts, increased somatic mutation rates in lymphocytes, and increased childhood, testicular, and other cancers. In addition, there is evidence of generalized increased disability rates from a variety of causes in one study and symptoms of sensitivity reactions and lenticular opacity in at least one other. These findings suggest that RF exposures are potentially carcinogenic and have other health effects. Therefore, prudent avoidance of unneeded exposures is recommended as a precautionary measure. Epidemiologic studies of occupational groups such as military users and air traffic controllers should have high priority because their exposures can be reasonably well characterized and the effects reported are suitable for epidemiologic monitoring. Additional community studies are needed...|$|E

40|$|Sandstones, limestones, {{and marble}} stones with {{different}} porosity {{were used as}} building materials for thousands of years. In the last century these materials have become vulnerable to atmospheric pollutants; the reaction of sulphur dioxide with calcareous (and decorated) surfaces is well known to form gypsum and black crusts. More recently, some mathematical models used for civil works have been applied to study the evolution of degradation phenomena; however, they did not fit sufficiently for artistic and historical hand-works, since they only give an averaged description of the damage. Between these mathematical models the Lipfert formula is the more diffuse, based on statistical models of atmospheric corrosion. In this paper a differential model was approached, which gives a quantitative description of the diffusion and the chemical action of sulphur dioxide on the porosity of calcium carbonate stones starting from {{the hypothesis that the}} interaction between stone surface and polluted air is due to its diffusion in the porosity of the material. The model has been validated by numerical simulations and a number of experimental tests in the laboratory. This approach gives a quantitative law for the penetration of the sulphation front inside of the stone, in accordance with the experimental data. Moreover, it is important to assess and prevent damage on the surfaces of historical monuments, considering also the local geometry, the nature of the polluted air, and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{further the}} {{development}} and application of exposure markers in field investigations in reproductive epidemiology, we have synthesized recent examinations of the issues surrounding exposure measurements in reproductive epidemiology. The specific goals of this paper are to define exposure biomarkers and explore their potential uses, particularly as screening tools. The tests for glucaric acid, thioethers, mutagenicity, and porphyrin patterns meet the general criteria for useful exposure screens. For certain xenobiotic agents, these tests accurately differentiate exposure levels, as demonstrated in occupational and environmental epidemiologic studies. As urinary screens, they are noninvasive and applicable {{on a large scale}} with current laboratory techniques. For short-term exposure, glucaric acid, thioethers, and mutagenicity tests are useful. Porphyrin patterns may measure cumulative effects as well as current exposure levels. The usefulness of these tests in epidemiologic studies of environmental effects on reproductive health has yet to be studied. To do so, the battery must be standardized for pregnant women, and test results must be correlated with measured adverse reproductive outcomes, such as gestational length and birthweight. This correlation is particularly important because maternal exposure rather than fetal exposure is being measured. The extent to which xenobiotic chemicals cross the placental barrier may vary greatly depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures,</b> timing in pregnancy, and maternal detoxification capability. Without better exposure measures, epidemiologic studies of reproductive health probably will not successfully identify xenobiotic fetotoxic agents in the environment. However, with an adequate battery of nonspecific exposure biomarkers, prospective studies of environmental effects on pregnancy outcomes might be possible. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

A catalogue of facilities and internal dosimetric techniques related to individual monitoring in Europe has been completed {{as a result of this}} EURADOS study. A questionnaire was sent in 2002 to services requesting information on various topics including <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures,</b> techniques used for direct and indirect measurements including calibration and sensitivity data and the methods employed for the assessment of internal doses. Information relating to Quality Control procedures for direct and indirect measurements, Quality Assurance Programmes in the facilities and legal requirements for ‘approved dosimetric services' were also considered. A total of 71 completed questionnaires were returned by internal dosimetry facilities in 26 countries. This results in an overview of the actual status of the processes used in internal exposure estimation in Europe. In many ways harmonisation is a reality in internal dose assessments, especially when taking into account the measurements of the activity retained or excreted from the body. However, a future study detailing the estimation of minimum detectable activity in the laboratories is highly recommended. Points to focus on in future harmonisation activities are as follows: the process of calculation of doses from measured activity, establishment of guidelines, similar dosimetric tools and application of the same ICRP recommendations. This would lead to a better and more harmonised approach to the estimation of internal exposures in all European facilitie...|$|E

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Farmácia (Toxicologia), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2014 Lead (Pb), arsenic (As) and {{manganese}} (Mn) are metals with neurotoxic {{effects that}} {{are present in}} mines as metal mixtures, making miners potentially vulnerable to {{an increased risk of}} neurotoxicity. Biomarkers can be crucial tools to detect these disorders in their earlier stages enabling patients to avoid the disease progression. Several biomarkers for Pb, As and Mn have been investigated, yet only for single exposures despite the different metals can interact within the brain. The aim of this work was to identify biomarkers of neurotoxicity which may be used to control and prevent the risk of chronic low levels exposure to the mixture of Pb, As and Mn. After performing an in vivo assay with Wistar rats repeatedly exposed (for 8 days) to Pb, As, Mn or the 3 -metal mixture, the co-exposure increased behavioral toxicity and augmented Pb’s deposition in brain more than upon single exposures, with blood Pb levels failing to reflect this alteration, thus, contributing to underestimate the risk associated with Pb-induced damages. Mechanistic insights concerning the consequences of in vivo Pb, As and Mn interactions revealed changes in neurotransmitters and heme precursors’ levels in the brain. Changes of these BMs in peripheral samples suggested their suitability to be used as BMs of exposure and/or neurotoxicity upon exposure to this mixture. A multibiomarker approach based on multiparameter analysis of independent markers was used; the results suggest that the combination of biomarkers is a better tool to predict the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> and the magnitude of neurotoxic effects, better than when used alone. A preliminary human study in a mining population was performed to apply the results obtained in the in vivo model. According to the results, the miners might be exposed to excessive levels of Pb, As and Mn, and the integration of experimentally selected BMs, Pb and Mn blood levels and urinary Pb, As and delta-aminolevulinic acid levels, revealed to be a good tool to identify excessive exposed workers. Exploration of BMs’ integration methodologies seems certainly promising to assess “real-life” scenarios of exposure to chemical mixtures...|$|E
40|$|PM 2. 5 {{variability}} {{within the}} neighborhood scale {{has not been}} thoroughly studied for wood burning communities. High variability in near-field PM 2. 5 concentration may lead to harmful public exposure since monitoring does not occur on that scale. This study measures near-field PM 2. 5 variability by measuring black carbon (BC), a component of PM 2. 5, in a 1 km 2 area located in Cambria, California. BC and meteorological data (when meteorological instruments were available) were measured over thirteen 12 -hour intensive operation periods (IOPs) occurring over the winters of 2009 and 2010. Near-field BC variability was measured to understand the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> found in communities where many homes are burning wood simultaneously within a small area. In addition, relationships between meteorological, geographical, and burning source characteristics and BC were observed as tools for understanding BC concentration. The computer air dispersion modeling programs, ISC-PRIME and ISCST 3, were also evaluated for applicability to the near field. BC concentrations were measured using 1 - to 2 -minute resolution aethalometers and 12 hour resolution Personal Environmental Monitors (PEMs). On average, over all IOPs and sites, aethalometer and PEM BC averages were very similar, ranging between 200 and 250 ng/m 3, or 4 and 5 µg/m 3 for PM 2. 5, and standard deviations were often high. Averaging all BC measurements, aethalometer BC standard deviation values were 360 percent of the average BC concentration and PEM BC standard deviations were 120 percent the average BC concentration. The average standard deviation detected during each IOP was 190 percent of the average BC concentration for aethalometers and 79 percent of the average BC concentration for PEMs. The average standard deviation detected at each site was 220 percent of the average BC concentration for aethalometers and 76 percent of the average BC concentration for PEMs. The larger standard deviations measured by higher resolution aethalometers demonstrated that low resolution instruments, such as PEMs, are unable to detect high concentrations that may occur. In addition to examining BC variability, multiple linear regression {{analyses were conducted to}} determine the impact of meteorological variables and geographic and burning source characteristics on BC concentration and a weighted BC deviation function (BC standard deviation divided by average BC concentration). Time impacts, humidity, and wind speed, accounted for about 50 percent of variability in aethalometer average BC and BC deviation. However, because all model assumptions were not satisfied, improvements are needed. Regression models based on PEM BC found wind speed and direction to account for about 80 percent of average PEM BC variability and number of burning sources to account for about 30 percent of PEM BC deviation. Although PEM BC models accounted for a high percentage of BC variability, few data points were available for the PEM analyses and more IOPs are needed to determine their accuracy. When evaluating correlations between geographic and burning source characteristics and PEM BC concentrations, specific IOP and PEM sampling location explained almost 70 percent of variability in BC concentration, though model residuals suggested model bias. IOP likely explained variation in burning patterns and meteorology over each night while sampling location was likely a proxy for housing density, tree coverage, and/or elevation. Because all regression model assumptions could not be satisfied, the predictors were also observed graphically. Plotting BC concentration versus the number of burning sources suggested that number of burning sources may affect BC concentration in areas of low tree coverage and high housing density and in the case that the level of surrounding vegetation and structures are minimal. More data points will be needed {{to determine whether or not}} these relationships are significant. ISC-PRIME and ISCST 3 modeling overall tended to under predict BC concentrations with average modeled-to-measured ratios averaging 0. 25 and 0. 15, for ISC-PRIME and ISCST 3, respectively. Correction factors of 9. 75 and 18. 2 for ISC-PRIME and ISCST 3, respectively, were determined to bring modeled BC concentrations closer to unity, but the range of ratios was still high. Both programs were unable to consistently capture BC variability in the area and more investigation will be needed to improve models. The results of the study indicate high BC variability exists on the near-field scale, but that the variability is not clearly explained by existing regression and air dispersion models. To prevent public exposure to harmful concentrations, more investigation will be needed to determine factors that largely influence pollutant variability on the neighborhood scale...|$|E

Two commonly-used methods for estimating monthly pan evaporation were found to be within 3 and 6 percent ofobserved values from the mountain area. Estimates of daily pan evaporation using the mass transfer equations derived from the Lake Hefner and Lake Mean water-loss investigations were found to over-estimate and under-estimate for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures.</b> The errors in the daily estimates were related to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and stability indices.

40|$|Abstract Background Declining {{fertility}} is a {{major concern}} for dairy farmers today. One explanation is shorter and weaker expression of oestrus in dairy cows making it difficult to determine optimal time for artificial insemination (AI). Chemical communication is of interest in the search for tools to detect oestrus or to synchronise or enhance oestrous periods. Pheromones, used in chemical communication within species, can influence reproduction in different ways. The aim here was to investigate whether oestrous cycle length, and duration and intensity of oestrous expression in dairy heifers could be manipulated through exposure to pheromones in oestrual substances from other females. Methods Beginning on day 16 of two consecutive control oestrous cycles, ten heifers of the Swedish Red Breed (SRB) were exposed to water. During the two following cycles the heifers were exposed to urine and vaginal mucus, obtained from cows in oestrus. Cyclicity parameters were monitored through hormone measurements, oestrus detection and ultrasonographic examination. Results We found no difference in cycle length or in duration of standing oestrus between control and treatment. We did, however, find a tendency <b>of</b> interaction between <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> (control or treatment) and cycle number within <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for cycle length (p = 0. 068), with the length differing less between the treatment cycles. We also found a tendency <b>of</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> on maximal concentration (p = 0. 073) and sum of concentrations (p = 0. 063) of LH during the LH surge, with values being higher for the control cycles.

Results Overall, 44. 5 % (n= 9, 798) of the study participants declared themselves to be exposed to SHS, 29. 1 % (n= 6, 394) declared to be exposed to SHS caused by cigarette smoke and 9. 4 % (n= 2, 067) claimed that a person who lives with them uses electronic cigarettes. There is a considerable overlap between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> SHS <b>exposure,</b> because 74. 9 % (n= 1, 548) of students declaring that a person within their household uses electronic cigarettes also declare a person in the household smoking cigarettes. The strengths of association between independent variables and SHS <b>exposure</b> differs by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and also by smoking status of respondents. Conclusions Although only small differences are obvious in the factors associated with SHS exposure stratified by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> tobacco product, there are still some variations which should be considered in policy making to allow for a targeted approach in prevention campaigns or legislation...|$|R
40|$|This book {{addresses}} methodological {{aspects of}} epidemiological studies on maternal {{drug use in}} pregnancy. Discussing the existing sources of error {{and how they can}} produce incorrect conclusions, it examines various epidemiological techniques and assesses their strengths and weaknesses. These refer both to the identification of outcomes (with special emphasis on congenital malformations) and to the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> (drug use). Further, the book discusses the problem of confounding and how to handle it, and provides a simple introduction to statistics. Special situations, e. g. different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>exposure,</b> are examined. Lastly, the book discusses pharmacovigilance and the information problem, concluding with a short list of aspects to consider when one wants to evaluate a published paper in the field. Though the book is primarily intended for pharmacologists, gynecologists and obstetricians, it will benefit all doctors working in perinatal care...|$|R
40|$|Pigeon's {{observational}} {{learning of}} successive visual discrimination was studied using within-subject comparisons {{of data from}} three experimental conditions. Two pairs of discriminative stimuli were used; each bird was exposed {{to two of the}} three experimental conditions, with different pairs of stimuli used in a given bird's two conditions. In one condition, observers were exposed to visual discriminative stimuli only. In a second condition, subjects were exposed to a randomly alternating sequence of two stimuli where the one that would subsequently be used as S+ was paired with the operation of the grain magazine. In a third experimental condition, subjects were exposed to the performance of a conspecific in the operant discrimination procedure. After exposures to conspecific performances, there was facilitation of discriminative learning, relative to that which followed exposures to stimulus and reinforcement sequences or exposures to stimulus sequences alone. Exposure to stimulus and food-delivery sequences enhanced performance relative to exposure to stimulus sequences alone. The differential effects <b>of</b> these three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> were not attributable to order effects or to task difficulty; rather, they clearly were due to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|R
