500|$|In the 2008–09 season, Nasri {{appeared}} in only three matches {{with the national}} team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost {{a year and a}} half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, [...] "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." [...] The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, [...] "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> need to work harder, to make sure I don't miss the next one." ...|$|E
60|$|But I would fight, I <b>told</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> {{would not}} yield easily. I promised {{that to my}} self-respect, and was rewarded with a certain glow of excitement. I felt defiant. I wanted to test myself at once.|$|E
60|$|I {{restrained}} myself this time, eschewing the careless vigour {{which had}} marked my previous efforts. The ball flew {{in a slow}} semicircle, and pitched inside the correct court. At least, I <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> had not served a fault.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it was. When I was {{in church}} that morning <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> never, never, could be happy unless {{you came to}} me again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my lord. This is {{a matter}} in which I could obey no friend, no father. I have had to ask <b>myself,</b> and <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> do not dare to love above my station in life." ...|$|R
60|$|That was the end, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> and involuntarily <b>I</b> also sighed. Still, I made no {{shift to}} go.|$|R
60|$|The {{story of}} Tomaso and Lucilla now went bravely on, with enough groundwork of foreign {{land for the}} {{characters}} to stand on, and I {{tried very hard to}} keep my mind on the writing of my book and away from its writer. Outwardly I may have appeared to succeed fairly well in this purpose, but inwardly the case was different. However, if I could suppress any manifestations of my emotions, I <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> ought to be satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sensation}} was {{as though}} something like an intermittent electric current was pouring through me. It's a ridiculous image to use, I can't justify it, {{but it was as}} if I was having cold blue light squirted through every pore of my being. There was an astonishment, a feeling of confirmation. 'Of course these things do happen sometimes,' I <b>told</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> don't remember that Challoner looked round or said anything at all. I am not sure that I looked at him....|$|E
60|$|Some {{little while}} I raged about the streets, and <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> was the worst-used lad in Christendom. Anger choked me; {{it was all}} very well for me to breathe deep; it seemed there was not air enough about Leyden to supply me, and I thought I would have burst like a man {{at the bottom of the}} sea. I stopped and laughed at myself at a street-corner a minute together, {{laughing}} out loud, so that a passenger looked at me, which brought me to myself.|$|E
6000|$|I {{sent him}} reeling {{across the room}} till he fell in the corner. Then I walked out, closing the sitting-room door behind me,--out into the {{corridor}} {{and up the stairs}} into my own room. Then I locked and bolted my own door and looked at my watch. It was a quarter to three. I took a Bradshaw from my bookcase, packed a few clothes myself, set an alarm clock for seven o'clock in the morning, and turned into bed. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> would not think. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that there was no such person in the world as Felicia, that she had never lived, that she was only part of this nightmare from which <b>I</b> was freeing <b>myself!</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> would go to sleep, and I stayed awake until daylight. All the time there was only one thought in my brain! ...|$|R
5000|$|The brand {{has struck}} up a celebrity fan-base {{including}} Joe Manganiello of HBOs True Blood. In his interview with GQ backstage at the Perry Ellis Spring 2012 runway show Manganiello said, [...] "I always <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> if <b>I</b> made it, Id look the part." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{is exactly}} what {{happened}} after I regained the house. I went upstairs for a few minutes to arrange my hair and bathe my eyes. Then I walked straight down to the drawing-room, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> was prepared for anything that might take place.|$|R
6000|$|I left her. As I walked home, I fancied {{the people}} were looking at me, and smiling. Once I {{was on the verge}} of going up to a man, and asking him why he laughed, but I {{contained}} myself. How I was suffering! I remembered that Giulia had not seemed so pleased to see me; at the time I chid myself, and called myself exacting, but was it true? I fancied she turned away her lips when I was imprinting my passionate kisses on them. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> was a fool, but was it true? I remembered a slight movement of withdrawal when I clasped her in my arms. Was it true? Oh God! was it true? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{once have}} I really meant marrying you," [...] she insisted. [...] "Never once. I {{fell in love}} with you from the first. But when you seemed a {{successful}} man, I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't. I was love-sick for you, and you were so stupid, I came near it then. But I knew I wasn't good enough. What could I have been to you? A woman with bad habits and bad associations, a woman smirched. And what could I do for you or be to you? If I wasn't good enough to be a rich man's wife, I'm certainly not good enough to be a poor one's. Forgive me for talking sense to you now, but I wanted to tell you this somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the long}} run that became a fixed idea. It {{entangled}} my will and my pride; I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> {{was not going to}} be beaten. I hardened to the business. I think, as a matter of fact, my real passion for Marion had waned enormously long before we were married, that she had lived it down by sheer irresponsiveness. When I felt sure of my three hundred a year she stipulated for delay, twelve months' delay, [...] "to see how things would turn out." [...] There were times when she seemed simply an antagonist holding out irritatingly against something I had to settle. Moreover, I began to be greatly distracted by the interest and excitement of Tono-Bungay's success, by the change and movement in things, the going to and fro. I would forget her for days together, and then desire her with an irritating intensity at last, one Saturday afternoon, after a brooding morning, I determined almost savagely that these delays must end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hester {{has told}} you, of course. I am not blaming her. She did quite right. Only I should have <b>told</b> you <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to be}} the first to assure you of this. Our secret is quite safe. The man--with whom I made a fool of myself--has given me his word of honour." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was obliged}} to study law because of family {{pressures}} and expectations. I preferred medicine because I felt Sarawak dearly needed doctors. I was maneuvered toward law by my uncle. When I entered politics in 1963, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> would give Parti Bumiputera five years of my life. Abdul Taib Mahmud, as reported by Douglas Bullis in 1996.|$|R
5000|$|I {{had some}} misgivings about all this, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> was really being good {{to him and}} meeting his {{emotional}} needs, had not used real violence or threatened him, etc. For the most part, the exhilaration of demonstrating my masculinity, of conquest, of sexual release swept those reservations aside. Somewhere deep in my soul, I suppose, there lurks a jailhouse rapist.|$|R
60|$|He {{was about}} sixteen, well set up, with a pleasant, merry, {{freckled}} face, {{and a pair}} of dancing eyes. There was an air at once deprecatory and insinuating about the rascal that I thought I recognised. There came to me from my own boyhood memories of certain passionate admirations long passed away, and the objects of them long ago discredited or dead. I remembered how anxious I had been to serve those fleeting heroes, how readily I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> would have died for them, how much greater and handsomer than life they had appeared. And looking in the mirror, {{it seemed to me that}} I read the face of Rowley, like an echo or a ghost, by the light of my own youth. I have always contended (somewhat against the opinion of my friends) that I am first of all an economist; and the last thing that I would care to throw away is that very valuable piece of property—a boy’s hero-worship.|$|E
60|$|The blood came in my face. No, I {{had never}} pressed him; I {{had never even}} {{encouraged}} him to come. I was proud of him, proud of his handsome looks, of his kind, gentle ways, of that bright face he could show when others were happy; proud, too--meanly proud, if you like--of his great wealth and startling liberalities. And yet {{he would have been}} in the way of my Paris life, of much of which he would have disapproved. I had feared to expose to criticism his innocent remarks on art; I had <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> had even partly believed, he did not want to come; I had been, and still am, convinced that he was sure to be unhappy out of Muskegon; in short, I had a thousand reasons, good and bad, not all of which could alter one iota of the fact that I knew he only waited for my invitation.|$|E
60|$|It will be {{seen that}} I had fallen into an ignominious {{intimacy}} with the man I had gone out to thwart. My pity for the creature, his admiration for myself, his pleasure in my society, which was clearly unassumed, were the bonds with which I was fettered; perhaps I should add, in honesty, my own ill-regulated interest in the phases of life and human character. The fact is (at least) that we spent hours together daily, and that I was nearly as much on the forward deck as in the saloon. Yet all the while I could never forget he was a shabby trickster, embarked that very moment in a dirty enterprise. I used to tell myself at first that our acquaintance was a stroke of art, and that I was somehow fortifying Carthew. I <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> say; but I was no such fool as to believe it, even then. In these circumstances I displayed the two chief qualities of my character on the largest scale--my helplessness and my instinctive love of procrastination--and fell upon {{a course of action}} so ridiculous that I blush when I recall it.|$|E
60|$|It {{was written}} {{as though in}} mine own handwriting, and very hastily scrawled, but so like that I could not have <b>told</b> it <b>myself</b> had <b>I</b> not known {{it to be a}} forgery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not. <b>I</b> {{have tried}} <b>myself,</b> and now <b>I</b> {{think that it}} would not hurt me. There was a time in which <b>I</b> owned to <b>myself</b> that it would be very bitter, and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> that <b>I</b> hoped,--that I hoped that you would wait. But now, I have {{acknowledged}} to myself the vanity and selfishness of such a wish. If I really love you am I not bound to want what may be best for you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Having {{graduated}} from the McGeorge School of Law, Wellisch decided to retire from MMA and now runs his own law practice outside San Jose, California. Speaking on his decision to retire, Wellisch said [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> when <b>I</b> got into this sport that I wasn't going to take any steps backwards", he also said [...] "I'm {{not going to go}} fight in the small shows, I think I made the right decision".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Peter,' she said, 'I want to {{tell you}} {{something}}. It will make you understand, I think. I haven't been honest, Peter. I have not fought fairly. All these weeks, ever since we met, I have been trying to steal you. It's the only word. I have tried every little miserable trick I could think of to steal you from the girl you had promised to marry. And she wasn't here to fight for herself. I didn't think of her. I was wrapped up in my own selfishness. And then, after that night, when you had gone away, I thought it all out. I had a sort of awakening. I saw the part I had been playing. Even then I tried to persuade myself that I had done something rather fine. I thought, you see, at that time that you were infatuated with Mrs Ford--and I know Mrs Ford. If she is capable of loving any man, she loves Mr Ford, though they are divorced. I knew she would only make you unhappy. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> was saving you. Then you told me it was not Mrs Ford, but this girl. That altered everything. Don't you see that I can't let you give her up now? You would despise me. I shouldn't feel clean. I should feel as if I had stabbed her in the back.' ...|$|E
60|$|The truth is, Case {{had done}} the courting for me in style--told her I was mad to have her, and cared nothing for the consequence; and the poor soul, knowing that which I was still ignorant of, {{believed}} it, every word, and had her head nigh turned with vanity and gratitude. Now, of all this I had no guess; I {{was one of those}} most opposed to any nonsense about native women, having seen so many whites eaten up by their wives' relatives, and made fools of in the bargain; and I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> must make a stand at once, and bring her to her bearings. But she looked so quaint and pretty as she ran away and then awaited me, and the thing was done so like a child or a kind dog, that the best I could do was just to follow her whenever she went on, to listen for the fall of her bare feet, and to watch in the dusk for the shining of her body. And there was another thought came in my head. She played kitten with me now when we were alone; but in the house she had carried it the way a countess might, so proud and humble. And what with her dress--for all there was so little of it, and that native enough--what with her fine tapa and fine scents, and her red flowers and seeds, that were quite as bright as jewels, only larger--it came over me she was a kind of countess really, dressed to hear great singers at a concert, and no even mate for a poor trader like myself.|$|E
5000|$|... “When I was 17, I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} be an artist[...] [...] I felt that art was like a drug. Once you are addicted, you can't get rid of it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' she said, 'yes. While I {{have you}} with me, and baby, I can bear anything. While you will tell me {{everything}} that happens, I will bear everything. And, John, when you were out just now, and when I am alone and trying to pray, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> {{ought not to be}} unhappy; for I would sooner have you and baby and all these troubles, than be back at Chesterton--without you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had meant}} {{to ask you to}} be my wife; simply that. But you shall not have the pain of making me a {{positive}} refusal. As I rode here to-day I thought of it. During my frequent rides of late I have thought of little else. But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> had no right to do it. I have not even a house in which it would be fit that you should live." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 10 July 2015, Haokip {{was drafted}} by Goa for the 2015 Indian Super League season. Despite his {{performance}} in the I-League the previous season, Haokip was nervous about not being selected in the draft: [...] "At that time, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> 'if <b>I</b> get picked up, it's good, if not I {{will have to work}} even harder.' Sometimes, I got this feeling that I won't be picked. There are many Indian and foreign players in the strikers position." ...|$|R
5000|$|The reason Wang is {{on stage}} is his mother. He said: [...] "My mother is like my girlfriend. We are very close. I'm still {{standing}} on stage {{today because of}} the pride I see on her face. I relish it. I fell wayward for 10 years, and she took care of me all those 10 years. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> would never break her heart again because, no matter what I'd done wrong in the past, my mother would still say, 'you are still my son.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Responding to the allegations, Chew retorted, [...] "I do {{not mind}} being famous {{for winning the}} Miss Universe crown, or as a singer, or a {{beautiful}} face, you know? Who wants to be famous for having AIDS? For goodness sake!...I have seen too many AIDS patients die. Most die alone. There is no warmth, no care for them. They {{are not ready to}} die- {{you can see it in}} their eyes. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> had to do something worthwhile for myself and for the cause- to clear the path for future patients, so that they will not die like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|When he was 14, {{his height}} reached 180 cm (5 ft 11 in). It was {{thought he was}} likely to be {{included}} in the Chinese Taipei U-15 squad, but he was not. [...] "At that time, I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> should enter the Taipei youth team in three years," [...] he said to the press after years. [...] Under the instruction of Pei Men goalkeeper coach Hung Chin-chang, he spent only two years to make his wish come true. He was called up to the Chinese Taipei U-21 at age 17, the U-23 at age 18, and eventually the senior team in 2004.|$|E
60|$|She had {{scarcely}} stirred {{for nearly}} an hour, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> wearily, that <b>I,</b> too, might perhaps catch a little rest. The day had been a perpetual strain. I was not expecting or intending to sleep soundly, but I felt a merciful relief in lying quietly {{by the side of}} Marjorie.|$|R
5000|$|Sutherland did {{not make}} a film in 1991. During an {{interview}} in March 2012, he said he had declined director Gus Van Sant's offer to star in the lead role in the movie My Own Private Idaho, a decision that he regretted. He was quoted as saying [...] "I passed on My Private Idaho because I wanted to go skiing and didn't even look at it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> needed to stick to my plan ... and it was a really dumb plan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} I say. I have no one. It is no use asking questions,--not now, {{at such a}} time as this. And I did not mean to complain. Complaining is weak and foolish. <b>I</b> have often <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> could bear anything, and so I will. When <b>I</b> can bring <b>myself</b> to think of what I have lost in my father I shall be better, even though I shall be more sorrowful. As it is, <b>I</b> hate <b>myself</b> for being so selfish." ...|$|R
