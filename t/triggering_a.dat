A {{few months after the}} election, Goldsmith also pledged to resign as an MP if the government were to announce plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Following the decision to build the runway, Goldsmith stood-down as MP for Richmond Park, <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> by-election, in which Goldsmith stood as an independent candidate. On 1 December 2016, Goldsmith, was defeated in the by-election by Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats, with Goldsmith's loss put down to his stance in favour of Britain's exit from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|The film's plot {{revolves}} around the assassination of billionaire Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond's subsequent assignment to protect King's daughter Elektra, who had previously been held for ransom by Renard.

5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones.

His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> higher level of consciousness.|$|E

50|$|Hering made {{significant}} contributions to the field of physiology as well as psychology. In particular he demonstrated with his student Breuer the Hering-Breuer reflex, or that artificially inflating the lungs <b>triggers</b> <b>an</b> automatic signal <b>triggering</b> expiration. Then deflating the lungs in turns <b>triggers</b> <b>a</b> new signal inducing respiration. I.e. inspirations and expirations are an endless reflex loop triggering each other. He also showed the Traube-Hering reflex, or that inflating the lungs <b>triggers</b> <b>an</b> acceleration of the heart.|$|R
5|$|In comparison, the South Island has {{experienced}} fewer large earthquakes.

Although similar aftershock sequences have historically occurred around the world, such occurrences were extremely unusual in the region, which had shown low levels of seismic activity for thousands of years. The event {{has led to the}} discovery of previously dormant geological faults across central-eastern South Island, in particular beneath regional plains and the adjacent seabed.|$|E

When the match begins, L Dubba E defeats JTRO {{in the first round}} but JTRO perseveres and wins the second and third rounds. L Dubba E tries to kill JTRO, <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> lengthy gunfight between the 248 and the 245.|$|E

Nagapattinam district was the most affected part of Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state. Sirkazhi remained mostly unaffected by the tsunami, but the groundwater quality deteriorated where aquifers were close to the water bodies. There was heavy salt water intrusion inland.|$|E

Canadian Navy ships en route to the US Gulf Coast, carrying relief supplies to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were delayed while trying to avoid Nate and Hurricane Ophelia.|$|E

5|$|With {{two outs}} in the 9th inning {{of a game}} against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in {{baseball}} history to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded. Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928) and Bill Nicholson (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was Abner Dalrymple in 1881. During {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Phillies on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by Ricky Bottalico, leading to Bonds charging the mound and <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> bench-clearing brawl.|$|E
5|$|As a third-person shooter with an {{emphasis}} on squad-based tactics, players can issue commands to Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams, who accompany the player for most of the game. Available commands include focusing fire on one particular target and ordering medical attention for an injured squad member. Adams can defeat enemies by using heavy gadgets or throwing grenades, while Lugo provides sniping assistance. Environmental hazards like sandstorms occasionally occur, drastically reducing the player's vision and visibility. Sand becomes a key gameplay mechanic and players can manipulate it at scripted moments in the game, such as <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> sand avalanche to bury enemies alive. When a grenade explodes on sand, dust clouds that can blind enemies are formed. Sand sometimes opens up new paths to allow players to progress.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E

While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E
5|$|Due to the FCC's {{limits on}} station {{ownership}} {{at the time}} (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing agreements in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand their reach, and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it â€“ consequentially <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, broadcasters still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.|$|E
5|$|Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave Ludlow Castle {{and most}} of the {{surrounding}} estates to Hugh's niece, Sybil, marrying her to Pain fitzJohn, one of his household staff.

Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, <b>triggering</b> <b>a</b> struggle for the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who had been planning to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy's son.
