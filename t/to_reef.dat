The threat <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> health is {{particularly}} strong in Southeast Asia, where 80% of reefs are endangered.

5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E

25|$|Reefs grow as polyps {{and other}} organisms deposit calcium carbonate, {{the basis of}} coral, as a {{skeletal}} structure beneath and around themselves, pushing the coral head's top upwards and outwards. Waves, grazing fish (such as parrotfish), sea urchins, sponges, and other forces and organisms act as bioeroders, breaking down coral skeletons into fragments that settle into spaces in the reef structure or form sandy bottoms in associated reef lagoons. Many other organisms living in the reef community contribute skeletal calcium carbonate in the same manner. Coralline algae are important contributors <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> structure in {{those parts of the}} reef subjected to the greatest forces by waves (such as the reef front facing the open ocean). These algae strengthen the reef structure by depositing limestone in sheets over the reef surface.|$|E
25|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition {{departed}} the UK {{less than}} {{five months after the}} Discovery was launched and only a week after the ship left Dundee. This left little time for the ship to undergo sea trials and the voyage to New Zealand was also the brand new vessel's shakedown cruise. Scott's first impression of the ship was poor, considering her slow and unresponsive while the shallow hull, built with no protuberances to work well in ice, provided minimal stability. Discovery rolled heavily once in the open sea (she was recorded rolling through 94 degrees - 47 degrees either side of vertical- in the Southern Ocean) and tended 'gripe' (wander to and fro along her course). Shackleton described the ship as a bad sailer, carrying too much sail aft and not enough forward while Scott also worried that the design of the ship's hull was unsuitable for work in pack ice. But once the expedition reached the Roaring Forties the ship proved to have excellent seakeeping and, because she was heavy and carried relatively little sail area for her size, she could make good progress in high winds and heavy seas without having <b>to</b> <b>reef.</b> The Discovery's unusual rounded, overhanging stern (one of the main changes from the original Bloodhound design) not only provided more protection for the rudder but also prevented all but the largest following seas breaking {{over the back of the}} ship and kept the decks dry, although the stern was prone to 'slamming' into waves, making the officer's accommodation and wardroom noisy.|$|E

Other genera included Myriophyllum, Isoetes (indicating the formation of littoral communities) and [...] Pediastrum. Algae grew in the lake, leading <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> knolls (bioherms) formed by carbonate rocks. These grew in several phases, and some were initially considered stromatolites.

Tube- and tuft-shaped structures also appear on these domes. Not all such structures formed during the Tauca episode. Similar structures have been found in the Ries crater in Germany, where Cladophorites species were responsible for their construction. Taxa identified at Lake Tauca include Chara species. The water above the tufa deposits was probably less than [...] deep. In some places (linked to Phormidium encrustatum and Rivularia species), limited stromatolitic development took place.|$|E

40|$|Proximity to habitat margins {{can alter}} the balance between {{positive}} and negative forces on species abundance. Based on this idea we examined abundance patterns of herbivorous gastropods in seagrasses adjacent <b>to</b> rocky <b>reefs.</b> We tested whether the balance between the intensity of predation (negative effect) and recruitment of new individuals (positive effect) changes with increasing distance from reefs. Abundances of gastropods varied with distance <b>to</b> <b>reefs,</b> but the direction of changes in abundance was taxon-specific: some taxa decreased in abundance with increasing distance from reefs (e. g. Pyrene bidentata), while others showed the opposite pattern (e. g. Cantharidus lepidus). Predators were more abundant on reefs and in immediately adjacent seagrasses, relative to seagrass meadow interiors. Predation intensity on 2 species with opposite patterns of abundance with proximity <b>to</b> <b>reefs</b> (P. bidentata and C. lepidus) was consistently higher in seagrasses near reef edges than in seagrass interiors, and C. lepidus was more susceptible to predation than P. bidentata. Recruitment of P. bidentata was higher in seagrasses adjacent <b>to</b> <b>reefs</b> relative <b>to</b> seagrass interiors, whereas recruitment of C. lepidus did not vary with distance from reefs. Dispersal of P. bidentata individuals from reefs probably explains the greater recruitment of P. bidentata at seagrass edges relative to interiors; this compensates for losses due to predation, thereby enabling high abundance in seagrasses adjacent <b>to</b> <b>reefs</b> despite suffering greater predation at this distance relative to the interiors of the seagrass meadows. In contrast, losses of C. lepidus due to predation reduced its abundance in seagrasses adjacent <b>to</b> <b>reefs,</b> while recruitment was invariant, so this species was most abundant in seagrass meadow interiors. Thus, proximity to habitat margins affected abundance patterns by influencing mortality (predation) and replenishment (recruitment) of populations. This balance was dependent on species identity, and led to contrasting patterns of abundance among species with proximity to habitat interfaces...|$|R

2500|$|Lionfish have {{successfully}} pioneered the coastal {{waters of the}} Atlantic {{in less than a}} decade and pose a major threat <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> ecological systems in these areas. A study comparing their abundance from Florida to North Carolina with several species of groupers found [...] they were second only to the native scamp grouper and equally abundant to the graysby, gag, and rock hind. This could be due to a surplus of resource availability resulting from the overfishing of lionfish predators like grouper. Although the lionfish has not expanded to a population size [...] currently causing major ecological problems, their invasion in the United States coastal waters could lead to serious problems in the future. One likely ecological impact caused by Pterois could be their impact on prey population numbers by directly affecting food web relationships. This could ultimately lead <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> deterioration and could negatively influence Atlantic trophic cascade. Lionfish have already been shown to overpopulate reef areas and display aggressive tendencies, forcing native species to move to waters where conditions might be less than desirable.|$|E
