5|$|Flies have rapid {{reflexes}} {{that aid}} their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low. Dolichopodid {{flies in the}} genus Condylostylus respond in less than 5 milliseconds <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> flashes by taking flight. In the past, the deer bot fly, Cephenemyia, was claimed {{to be one of}} the fastest insects on the basis of an estimate made visually by Charles Townsend in 1927. This claim, of speeds of 600 to 800 miles per hour, was regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by Irving Langmuir. Langmuir suggested an estimated speed of 25 miles per hour.|$|E

50|$|Some {{synchronization}} methods employ optical {{or radio}} triggering that requires no electrical connection <b>to</b> the <b>camera</b> or main flash unit. This allows the <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> move without the restriction of cables. Optical triggering requires {{at least one}} flash electrically connected <b>to</b> the <b>camera.</b> A sensor, either built-in or external to a remote slave flash unit, will sense {{the light from the}} master flash and cause a remote flash to fire. Radio triggering requires a transmitter electrically connected <b>to</b> the <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> trigger a remote receiver connected to (or embedded into) a remote flash unit.|$|R
25|$|Other {{results from}} {{physical}} and geometrical optics apply <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> optics. For example, the maximum resolution capability {{of a particular}} camera set-up {{is determined by the}} diffraction limit associated with the pupil size and given, roughly, by the Rayleigh criterion.|$|E
25|$|In early episodes {{the show}} briefly {{examines}} how {{the characters are}} struggling {{to deal with the}} absence of Margaret from their lives.

50|$|In digital {{photography}}, medium format refers either <b>to</b> <b>cameras</b> {{adapted from}} medium-format film photography uses, or <b>to</b> <b>cameras</b> {{making use of}} sensors larger {{than that of a}} 35 mm film frame. Often, medium-format film cameras can be retrofitted with digital camera backs, converting them <b>to</b> digital <b>cameras,</b> but some of these digital backs, especially early models, use sensors smaller than a 35 mm film frame. As of 2013, medium-format digital photography sensors were available in sizes of up to 40.3 by 53.7 mm, with 60 million pixels for use with commonly available professional medium-format cameras. Sensors used in special applications such as spy satellites can be even larger, but are not necessarily described as medium-format equipment.|$|R
50|$|Another {{common form}} of autobracketing is white balance autobracketing (sometimes {{abbreviated}} to WBB for White Balance Bracketing); this applies only <b>to</b> digital <b>cameras,</b> not <b>to</b> film <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
25|$|The film {{consists}} of a fluent succession of fifty short sketches, most with a tragicomic undertone. The cast is mostly non-professional, and alienating techniques are employed such as presenting the characters in grim make-up and having them talk directly <b>to</b> <b>camera.</b> The financing was difficult and the shooting took three years to complete. The film won the Silver Hugo Award for Best Direction at the 2007 Chicago International Film Festival and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Afternoon {{television}} news bulletins during {{the mid to}} late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> while {{sitting on the edge of}} a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the Nine O'Clock News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.|$|E
25|$|In October 1970 a technicians' dispute {{turned into}} a {{work-to-rule}} when sound staff were denied a pay rise given <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused {{to work with the}} new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including Coronation Street The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 8 February 1971.|$|E

25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E
25|$|Another notable stylistic {{technique}} {{is that the}} soliloquies of York in Act 1, Scene 1 and Act 3, Scene 1, {{as well as those}} of Eleanor and Hum in Act 1, Scene 2, and York's asides in Act 1, Scene 1 and Act 3, Scene 1 are all delivered direct <b>to</b> <b>camera,</b> as is the Dick the Butcher's comments in Act 4, Scene 2, as Cade delivers his speech to the masses. Also worth noting is that the character of George Plantagenet is introduced just prior to the Battle of St Albans, whereas in the text, he is not introduced until 3 Henry VI, Act 2, Scene 2. Additionally, Buckingham is killed onscreen whereas in the play, his fate is unknown, only revealed in the opening lines of 3 Henry VI to have been killed by Edward.|$|E
25|$|As {{a writer}} and narrator, he {{continued}} to collaborate with the BBC Natural History Unit in the new millennium. Alastair Fothergill, a senior producer with whom Attenborough had worked on The Trials of Life and Life in the Freezer, was making The Blue Planet (2001), the Unit's first comprehensive series on marine life. He decided not to use an on-screen presenter due to difficulties in speaking <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> through diving apparatus, but asked Attenborough to narrate the films. The same team reunited for Planet Earth (2006), the biggest nature documentary ever made for television and the first BBC wildlife series to be shot in high definition. In 2009, he co-wrote and narrated Life, a ten-part series focussing on extraordinary animal behaviour, and narrated Nature's Great Events, which showed how seasonal changes trigger major natural spectacles. In 2011, Fothergill gave Attenborough a more prominent role in Frozen Planet, a major series on {{the natural history of}} the polar regions; Attenborough appeared on screen and authored the final episode, in addition to performing voiceover duties. Attenborough introduced and narrated the Unit's first 4K production Life Story. For Planet Earth II (2016), Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter, with the main theme music composed by Hans Zimmer.|$|E
30|$|Several {{approaches}} {{exist for}} calibration of laser scanners <b>to</b> <b>cameras.</b> Oftentimes, these methods are categorized by {{the type of}} laser scanner they operate on, namely methods for line scanners and methods for 2.5 -D laser scanners.|$|R

5000|$|Noiseware is {{described}} as [...] "self learning", meaning it improves {{with the number of}} images it sees, does not rely on camera profiles, and is not limited only <b>to</b> <b>cameras</b> known {{at the time of its}} release.|$|R
500|$|In 1971 John Culshaw of BBC {{television}} commissioned [...] "André Previn's Music Night", bringing {{classical music}} {{to a large}} new audience. Previn would talk informally direct <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> and then turn and conduct the LSO, whose members were dressed in casual sweaters or shirts rather than formal evening clothes. The programme attracted unprecedented viewing figures for classical music; Morrison writes, [...] "More British people heard the LSO play in Music Night in one week than in sixty-five years of LSO concerts." [...] Several series of the programme were screened between 1971 and 1977. Previn's popularity with the public enabled him and the LSO to programme works that under other conductors could have been box-office disasters, such as Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony. In the early 1970s the LSO recorded two firsts for a British orchestra, appearing at the Salzburg Festival, conducted by Previn, Seiji Ozawa and Karl Böhm, in 1973, and playing at the Hollywood Bowl the following year.|$|E
500|$|Although by {{the early}} 1960s Levin was {{becoming}} a well-known name, his was not yet a well-known face. Meeting him in London the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis did not immediately recognise him: [...] "He looks about sixteen, and at first I thought he was someone’s little boy brought along to see the fun – very Jewish, with wavy fairish hair, very intelligent and agreeable to talk to". In 1963 Levin was invited to appear regularly on BBC television's new weekly late-night satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was, where he delivered monologues <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> about his pet hates and conducted interviews, appearing as [...] "a tiny figure taking on assorted noisy giants in debate". The programme, which had a short but much-discussed run, was transmitted live; this added to its edginess and impact, but also made it prone to disruption. Levin was twice assaulted on air, once by the husband of an actress whose show Levin had reviewed severely, and once by a woman astrologer who squirted him with water.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} Eastern Spirit roll realistically in the storm, the {{developers}} {{had to write}} a completely new program. They found that making the ship move was easy, but getting it to respond to storm conditions was much more complex. As such, they created a complete roll editor, called the Darkwave editor, which allowed them to control the pitch (when the ship moves on the horizontal axis) and the roll (when it moves on the vertical axis) separately. The combination of moving the ship on both axes allowed the developers to create realistic ship movements. This in turn allowed them to time the exact movement of the ship to coincide with {{what was happening in}} the game without having to use a cutscene. However, creating such a realistic movement system led <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> problems. According to programmer, Claude Levastre, early in development, [...] "the camera was constantly going through the walls because of the roll movement. So we had to develop an inertia-control system for the camera, just as if a cameraman is using a steadicam behind the hero." [...] Another change brought about by the ship's motion was that initially, the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship were scripted, but this was later replaced with real physics.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2009, an [...] "Internet Eyes" [...] website was {{announced}} which would pay {{members of the}} public <b>to</b> view CCTV <b>camera</b> images from their homes and report any crimes they witnessed.

Civil liberties campaigners criticized the idea as [...] "a distasteful and a worrying development".|$|R

500|$|The aim from {{an early}} stage was not to {{simulate}} diving, but instead to capture the dream-like feeling of ocean exploration. As part of his research, Nava experimented with other ocean simulation games and found they were not [...] "fun". By removing any time limit or air gauge, the team sought to promote a relaxing sense of exploration. One of the main issues was giving the player complete freedom to swim around, including doing a full loop—this effect was normally held back due <b>to</b> <b>camera</b> difficulties, but Giant Squid managed {{to resolve the issue}} and allow for greater range of movement. The meditation mechanic was added during later development from 2015 to 2016 as a means of allowing players a view of the surrounding marine life and environment. When choosing their game engine, Matt Nava was still the only staff member and so they needed an easy-to-use platform with tools and technology to create his vision. Unreal Engine 4 was still quite new at this time, but it was chosen after the team had vetted other developer software available at the time. The team were able to use both Unreal Engine 4's advanced developer tools and expand the engine's functionality to incorporate unique elements such as fish shoal behavior, vegetation animation, and underwater lighting. Using Unreal Engine 4 allowed engineer Derek Cornish to construct unique systems for underwater lighting effects.|$|E
