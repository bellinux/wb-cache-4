5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. <b>The</b> <b>PSC</b> located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>PSC</b> instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, <b>the</b> <b>PSC</b> {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, <b>the</b> <b>PSC</b> and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E

40|$|After the Cold War {{there has}} been a {{tremendous}} growth in the private security industry. Private security companies (PSCs) are increasingly replacing or supplementing national military in conflict areas. In this master thesis I discuss the relationship between the United States and <b>the</b> <b>PSCs</b> it hires Colombia. The character of <b>the</b> <b>PSCs</b> is disputed. Companies portray themselves as modern business entities that provide a wide range of services and have a varied group of customers. Critics on the other hand compare <b>the</b> <b>PSCs</b> to lawless mercenaries. The lack of accountability is the most common argument against <b>the</b> use of <b>PSCs.</b> I {{take a closer look at}} this argument by investigating how the United States uses and controls PSCs in Colombia. Since year 2000 the US has spent around $ 4 billion on support to "Plan Colombia" – the Colombian government's programme to fight drug trafficking and illegally armed groups. As part of the support the US has hired PSCs to provide intelligence, spray and destroy coca plants and train the Colombian army and police. The research question is: To what degree is the United States able to control the private security companies it hires in Colombia? The question focuses on the relationship between the policy makers in the US Congress, the US government that is responsible for enforcing the laws and the hired service providers in <b>the</b> <b>PSCs.</b> I use <b>the</b> Congress' conditions on US assistance to Colombia as a starting point and discuss to what extent these are followed by <b>the</b> <b>PSCs.</b> Agency theory is the theoretical framework in this thesis. It is discussed if the agents in <b>the</b> <b>PSCs</b> act in ways that are in conflict with the interest of the one that has delegated the power – the principal, here the US Congress and the US government. The literature review is supplemented with interviews that were conducted in Colombia in the beginning of 2006. I discuss <b>the</b> role of <b>PSCs</b> in combat and their functions as intelligence providers. I also analyse how the personnel cap that has been set by the US Congress is handled, and how companies and employees from different countries are bound together through a complicated network of subcontractors. The literature review and the interviews in Colombia did not uncover that <b>the</b> <b>PSCs</b> are trigger-happy villains acting outside the control of the US government. The findings suggest that the US government is quite capable of controlling <b>the</b> <b>PSCs.</b> <b>The</b> high level of secrecy might however weaken the accountability and stop people outside the government from comprehending the effects of the privatisation of military services. <b>The</b> way <b>the</b> <b>PSCs</b> operate in Plan Colombia does not give the US Congress and the US people – the ultimate principals – the possibility to fully understand what the consequences of their delegation of power really are...|$|R

5|$|The Flushing Line west of 103rd Street {{opened in}} 1917. The IRT agreed {{to operate the}} line under the {{condition}} that any loss of profits would be repaid by the city. As part of the agreement, <b>the</b> <b>PSC</b> would build the line eastward to at least Flushing. The station, as well as two other stations at Willets Point Boulevard and 111th Street, was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the Flushing Line past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the double-deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21, 1923, with the station built via cut-and-cover methods. The bridge was completed in 1927, and the station opened on January 21, 1928, over a decade after the line initially began operation.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore {{is confined to}} matters of public law, and the applicable tests are the source test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her employment contract was later terminated. She complained to various statutory bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against <b>the</b> <b>PSC.</b> In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power.|$|E
