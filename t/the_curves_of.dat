5|$|The first {{mathematician}} {{to discover}} the existence of curves of constant width, and to observe that the Reuleaux triangle has constant width, may have been Leonhard Euler. In a paper that he presented in 1771 and published in 1781 entitled De curvis triangularibus, Euler studied curvilinear triangles as well as <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> constant width, which he called orbiforms.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E

25|$|The picture's {{theatrical}} design {{places the}} most prominent figures in a shallow foreground stage. Immediately behind them are a diverting company of pages, halberdiers, dwarfs, dogs and monkeys, and in the further distance looms an architectural screen, an arched promenade parallel to the picture plane and supporting more spectators. These are pictorial preferences typical of Veronese, with the placement of figures and edifices reinforcing a processional character. <b>The</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> the distant arches echo {{the movement of the}} supplicated foreground figures, while the gesture of Sisygambis corresponds to and is reinforced by the verticals of the central fountain; the architectural geometry organizes the movement of the figures.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{restoration}} {{works in}} the 1980s cost some of its architecture features to be hidden or badly damaged. The fish scaled tiles were all taken down and cleaned, all 3,000 tiles were individually numbered {{to allow it to}} be replaced in the correct sequence. Every row of tiles was shaped differently, so as to match <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> the dome. Badly restored tiles were removed and new replaced tiles were made in the original zinc material used in the old 19th century tiles made in Manchester, England. The tiles had deteriorated badly due to the effects of acid rain. A titanium-zinc-based coating was used to protect the new tiles, to prevent further oxidation and erosion.|$|E

30|$|RSpring has {{implemented}} {{several other}} algorithms. For instance, the NLAT (Noncovered Load-Amortizing Tune) shown in Fig.  3 (c) {{is similar to}} the CLAT algorithm in Fig.  3 (a). However, we can see that in NLAT, “fairness” is more highlighted than that in CLAT. Because <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> L can be upgraded before <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> of H (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> H does not always cover that of L). That is why NLAT is named as: Noncovered Load-Amortizing Tune. For another instance, the NCTT (Noncovered Carry-Through Tune) in Fig.  3 (d) is similar to CCTT in Fig.  3 (b). Their main difference is that in NCTT, “fairness” is highlighted at the granularity of “AC.” Because in NCTT <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> L can be upgraded before <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> H, and because L will be upgraded all the way to its highest level before H can be upgraded.|$|R
25|$|This {{implies that}} the number of {{singular}} points is finite as long as p(x,y) or P(x,y,z) is square free. Bézout's theorem implies thus {{that the number of}} singular points is at most (d−1)2, but this bound is not sharp because the system of equations is overdetermined. If reducible polynomials are allowed, the sharp bound is d(d−1)/2, this value being reached when the polynomial factors in linear factors, that is if the curve is the union of d lines. For irreducible curves and polynomials, the number of singular points is at most (d−1)(d−2)/2, because of the formula expressing the genus in term of the singularities (see below). The maximum is reached by <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> genus zero whose all singularities have multiplicity two and distinct tangents (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{script is}} an {{integrated}} series of evolutions and formations. The band first forms a triple Block O formation, then slowly unwinds {{to form the}} letters while playing Robert Planquette's Le Régiment de Sambre et Meuse. The drum major leads the outside O into a peel-off movement around <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> the script, every musician in continual motion. Slowly the three blocks unfold into a long singular line which loops around, creating the OSUMB's trademark. Unlike a typical follow-the-leader drill, the Script Ohio is a very specifically measured and charted maneuver. Each band member is required to memorize the counts for each portion of the formation. Squad Leaders, {{as part of their}} tryout drills, are required to march a Script Ohio, individually, from their spot in the block to their final charted position to ensure they are counting and not just following the person in front of them. This is also required in the event that the drum major is incapacitated for some reason (injury, sudden illness).|$|E

500|$|Huế's Đồng Khánh Girl's High School, {{which opened}} in 1917, was widely praised for the ao dai uniform worn by its students.

The style was promoted by the artists of Tự Lực văn đoàn ("Self-Reliant Literary Group") as a national costume for the modern era. The painter Lê Phô introduced several popular styles of ao dai beginning in 1934. Such Westernized garments temporarily disappeared during World War II (1939–45).|$|E

500|$|Legionary {{soldiers}} of the 1st and 2nd centuries had use of the lorica segmentata, or laminated-strip cuirass, as well as (lorica hamata) and scale armour (lorica squamata). Testing of modern replicas have demonstrated that segmentata was impenetrable to most direct and missile strikes. It was, however, uncomfortable: reenactors have discovered that chafing renders it painful to wear for longer {{than a few hours}} at a time, and it was also expensive to produce and difficult to maintain. In the 3rd century, the segmentata appears to have fallen out of use and troops were depicted wearing chain mail or scale. The artistic record shows that most late Roman soldiers wore metal armour, despite Vegetius' statement to the contrary. For example, illustrations in the Notitia Dignitatum show that the army's fabricae (arms factories) were producing mail armour {{at the end of the}} 4th century. Actual examples of quite large sections of mail have been recovered, at Trier (with a section of scale), Independenta, and Weiler-La-Tour, within a late 4th-century context. Officers and some soldiers may have worn muscle cuirasses, together with decorative pteruges. The catafractarii and clibanarii cavalry, from limited pictorial evidence and especially from the description of these troops by Ammianus, may have worn specialised forms of armour. In particular their limbs were protected by laminated defences, made up of curved and overlapping metal segments: [...] "Laminarum circuli tenues apti corporis flexibus ambiebant per omnia membra diducti" [...] (Thin circles of iron plates, fitted to <b>the</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> their bodies, completely covered their limbs). Such laminated defences are attested by a fragment of manica found at Bowes Moor, dating to the late 4th century AD.|$|E
