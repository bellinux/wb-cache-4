40|$|For {{the design}} of {{on-shore}} pipelines installed {{in areas that are}} susceptible to ground movements and offshore pipelines, axial stresses above yield must be considered. In such so-called strain-based design, knowledge of the stress-strain behaviour of the pipeline steel and girth welds is highly important.
