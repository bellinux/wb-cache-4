5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance</b> required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E

50|$|The naval {{version of}} the 'Flanker', the Su-27K (or Su-33), {{incorporates}} canards for additional lift, reducing <b>takeoff</b> <b>distances.</b> These canards have also been incorporated in some Su-30s, the Su-35, and the Su-37.|$|R
50|$|From {{the first}} flight on 23 June 1932, and in the further course of testing, {{it was obvious that}} the Argus engine was underpowered, making <b>takeoff</b> <b>distances</b> {{substantially}} too long. However, financial difficulties in the company meant that fitting the stronger Gnome-Rh√¥ne Titan 5Ke took some time.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{air with}} higher {{humidity}} is less dense, providing lower lift and lower propeller or turbine efficiency (this is somewhat offset by decreased drag). Pilots must take humidity {{into account when}} calculating <b>takeoff</b> <b>distances</b> because high humidity will require longer runways and will decrease the climb gradient.|$|R
25|$|An unmodified {{production}} F8F-1 set a 1946 time-to-climb record (after {{a run of}} 115ft/35m) of 10,000ft (3,048m) in 94 seconds (6,383 fpm). The Bearcat {{held this}} record for 10 years until it was broken by a jet fighter (which still could not match the Bearcat's short <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance).</b>|$|E

25|$|After being {{awarded a}} {{contract}} (AC-14582) on 14 February 1947, McDonnell built two prototypes, designated the XF-88 Voodoo. The first prototype (serial number 46-6525), powered by two 3,000lbf (13.3kN) Westinghouse XJ34-WE-13 turbojets, flew from Muroc on 20 October 1948. Preliminary testing revealed that while handling and range was adequate, the top speed was a disappointing 641mph (1,032km/h) at sea level. After fitting McDonnell-designed afterburners {{to the second}} prototype, thrust was increased to 3,600lbf (16.1kN) with corresponding performance increases in top speed, initial rate of climb and reduced <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance.</b> Fuel consumption was greatly increased by use of the afterburners, however, reducing the range.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} {{evolved in}} the years between World War I and World War II. Flight decks were installed on several different types of ships to explore the possibilities of operating naval aircraft without the performance limitations of floatation devices required for seaplanes and flying boats. The most successful of these early aircraft carriers were built from battlecruisers. Battlecruisers typically had a speed of about , which was several knots faster {{than the speed of}} contemporary battleships. Additional speed was not necessary for maintaining station with the battle fleet, but enabled the carrier {{to catch up with the}} battle fleet after temporarily leaving formation to turn into the wind for launch or recovery of aircraft. The speed of the carrier during launch effectively decreased the <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance</b> for embarked aircraft, so faster carriers could operate heavier aircraft with greater range and superior combat capability. As such naval aircraft became operational, no nation could risk fielding less capable aircraft; so the speed of later purpose-designed aircraft carriers was set by the speed of the converted battle cruisers. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the displacement of purpose-designed aircraft carriers to 23,000 tons.|$|E
500|$|Costs {{continued}} to rise, {{which led to}} concerns at both company and government upper management levels, and the aircraft was also falling short {{of many of the}} requirements laid out in OR.343, such as <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance</b> and combat radius.

The model possessed positive static longitudinal stability to nearly 28 deg angle of attack, the maximum tested, both with and without leading-edge flaps deflected. Lateral control with differentially deflected ailerons and a right wing spoiler simultaneously deployed as combined controls was only slightly greater than that with the differentially deflected ailerons deployed as a separate control without the spoiler.

500|$|In May 1970, the USAF {{issued a}} modified, more {{detailed}} {{request for proposals}} (RFP) for the aircraft. The threat of Soviet armored forces and all-weather attack operations had become more serious. The requirements now included that the aircraft would be designed specifically for the 30mm rotary cannon. The RFP also specified a maximum speed of , <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance</b> of , external load of , [...] mission radius, and a unit cost of US$1.4million. The A-X {{would be the first}} USAF aircraft designed exclusively for close air support. During this time, a separate RFP was released for A-X's 30mm cannon with requirements for a high rate of fire (4,000 round per minute) and a high muzzle velocity. Six companies submitted aircraft proposals, with Northrop and Fairchild Republic selected to build prototypes: the YA-9A and YA-10A, respectively. General Electric and Philco-Ford were selected to build and test GAU-8 cannon prototypes.|$|E
500|$|The USAF {{announced}} the CFM56 {{as the winner}} of the re-engine contract in January 1980. Officials indicated that they were excited at the prospect of replacing the Pratt & Whitney J57 engines currently flying on the KC-135A aircraft, calling them [...] "...the noisiest, dirtiest, [...] most fuel inefficient powerplant still flying" [...] at the time. The re-engined aircraft was designated the KC-135R. The CFM56 brought many benefits to the KC-135, decreasing <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance</b> by as much as 3,500ft (1,100m), decreasing overall fuel usage by 25%, greatly reducing noise (24dB lower) and lowering total life cycle cost. With those benefits in mind, the United States Navy selected the CFM56-2 to power their variant of the Boeing707, the E-6 Mercury, in 1982. In 1984 the Royal Saudi Air Force selected the CFM56-2 to power their E-3 Sentry aircraft (also related to the 707 airframe). The CFM56-2-powered E-3 also became the standard configuration for aircraft purchased by the British and French.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{ordered a}} flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' {{entry into the}} Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was {{as much of a}} moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust [...] than GALCIT-27, and again reduced <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance</b> by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that [...] "We now have something that really works and {{we should be able to}} help give the Fascists hell!" ...|$|E
50|$|Only {{one example}} of the type was constructed, allotted civil {{registration}} G-AACN. It used slots and flaps to achieve the necessary low speed and short <b>takeoff</b> and landing <b>distances</b> for the various safety prizes.|$|R
40|$|Short takeoff {{and landing}} (STOL) and {{advanced}} short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft are being pursued for deployment {{near the end}} of this century. These concepts offer unique capabilities not seen in conventional aircraft: for example, shorter <b>takeoff</b> <b>distances</b> and the ability to operate from damaged runways and remote sites. However, special technology is critical to the development of this unique class of aircraft. Some of the real issues that are associated with these concepts are hot gas ingestion and airframe heating while in ground effects. Over the past nine years, NASA Lewis Research Center has been involved in several cooperative programs in the 9 - by 15 Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel (LSWT) to establish a database for hot gas ingestion and airframe heating. The modifications are presented that were made in the 9 - by 15 -Foot LSWT, including the evolution of the ground plane, model support system, and tunnel sidewalls; and flow visualization techniques, instrumentation, test procedures, and test results. The 9 - by 15 -Foot LSWT tests were conducted at full scale exhaust nozzle pressure ratios. The headwind velocities varied from 8 to 120 kn depending on the concept (STOL or STOVL). Typical compressor-face distortions (pressure and temperature), ground plane contours, and model surface temperature profiles are presented...|$|R
25|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{was introduced}} in mid-2014 and allows self-launching. A handful have been sold (and some were retrofitted to earlier sold models). <b>Takeoff</b> roll <b>distance</b> is 50 m and rate of climb when fully charged is 2.5 m/s. It can run at full power for 11 min on one charge. The electrical motor uses 10.5kW at 3800 rpm, and propeller delivers 37 daN when flying at 75 km/h. Storage is a 14s1p Lithium polymer battery (Kokam) with 40Ah capacity, delivering 2.07 kWh, maximum 58.8V and maximum continuous current 200A.|$|R
500|$|The Group's {{aim was to}} find a {{replacement}} for black-powder rocket motors‚Äîunits consisting of charcoal, sulfur and potassium nitrate with a binding agent. The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft. The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of amide, corn starch, and ammonium nitrate bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an ERCO Ercoupe plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.‚Äîwatched by Clark Millikan and William F. Durand‚Äîpiloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at the March Air Force Base in Moreno Valley, California. It proved a success and reduced <b>takeoff</b> <b>distance</b> by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded. Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that [...] "at least it wasn't a big hole", but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.|$|E

50|$|The Series 10 {{was unique}} in the DC-9 family in not having leading edge slats. The Series 10 was {{designed}} to have short <b>takeoff</b> and landing <b>distances</b> {{without the use of}} leading edge high-lift devices. Therefore, the wing design of the Series 10 featured airfoils with extremely high maximum lift capability in order to obtain the low stalling speeds necessary for short field performance.|$|R
50|$|The faster an {{aircraft}} flies, the more lift {{can be produced}} by each unit of wing area, so a smaller wing can carry the same mass in level flight. Consequently, faster aircraft generally have higher wing loadings than slower aircraft. This increased wing loading also increases <b>takeoff</b> and landing <b>distances.</b> A higher wing loading also decreases maneuverability. The same constraints apply to winged biological organisms.|$|R
25|$|The PC-24 {{is powered}} by a pair of Williams FJ44-4A {{turbofan}} engines. A unique feature of the FJ44-4A powerplant is the Quiet Power Mode; in addition to providing thrust and main power, standby power is also drawn from the main engines in Quiet Power Mode, in place of a separate auxiliary power unit (APU). An additional 5 per cent is available via an Automatic Thrust Reserve feature. The engines are mounted on the upper portion of the rear fuselage to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) during operations at rough airstrips. Other FOD-reduction measures include the enlarged flaps and chines on the nose wheel of the landing gear. The exhaust ducts of the engines feature an aerodynamic modification, having been shaped so the outflow contributes to the thrust vector during takeoff, reducing the <b>takeoff</b> roll <b>distance.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Doolittle and Hornet skipper Captain Marc Mitscher {{decided to}} launch the B-25s immediately‚Äî10 hours early and [...] farther from Japan than planned.

2500|$|In June 1946, the XB-35 {{made its}} first flight, a 45-minute trip from Hawthorne, California, to Muroc Dry Lake, without incident.

Microfilmed records of reports and correspondence of the XB-35 program relate that after three or four flights, power plant and propeller vibrations increased, and the very efficient contra-rotating propellers began failing with frustrating frequency. Meetings were called by Northrop, of the AAF, Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Standard where no one would take responsibility for correcting the AAF's engines and propellers. In addition, the AAF failed to supply the AC electrical alternator, insisting on Northrop using an onboard auxiliary power unit (APU) unit driven by an automotive engine which limited the high-altitude, high-speed XB-35 to test flights below [...] The AAF also refused to allow Northrop proposed modification of the bomb bays to carry the standard Mk. 3 atomic bomb, {{while at the same}} time declaring the AF would not buy the bomber unless it could carry the A-bomb.
