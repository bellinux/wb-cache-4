In addition, the Kizlar Agha of Istanbul disliked al-Azm for apparently not <b>taking</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> when he passed through Damascus on the pilgrim caravan. The Ottoman state was also interested in confiscating the wealth al-Azm accumulated during his tenure in office. The large amounts of money collected made the state revalue its currency. He was transferred to Aleppo and later dismissed and executed. This marked the end of the family's golden age. It continued to assert some influence, and many of its members served as walis later, but its great days were over.

Up he went, and when I ran back, I could see a dark figure on the wall, above him. Somebody was pulling him up.|$|R
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} film's plot originated when veteran Indian writer Dayanand Rajan {{claimed that the}} plot of the film was plagiarised from his unpublished novel Summer Snow. It's shocking that the main plot, the love story, the hero being wheelchair-bound due to an accident and even the mercy killing are the same as in the movie. The other similarities include a serious accident, in both the scripts, which require the protagonist to begin using a wheelchair and introduce him to the woman <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> – it is the nurse who falls in love with Hrithik, while in the novel it is his wife who looks after him. Both scripts having key flashback scenes and the woman supporting mercy killing for the hero. Raajan has dashed off a legal notice to the producers, UTV and Bhansali asking them for an explanation on how their film has so many similarities with his novel but Bhansali's office refused to accept the notice. In late-October, a PIL was filed by Aditya Dewan, a lawyer, in Delhi High Court alleging that Guzaarish promotes euthanasia or mercy killing, which is illegal, and portrays the legal profession in bad light. He demanded a disclaimer from the producers saying mercy killing is not legal in India {{and that there is a}} debate on whether such deaths can be allowed. But the case was dismissed by the court saying the facts averred were inadequate for the court to appreciate and that it cannot be entertained in its present form..|$|E

6000|$|The next mail {{brought me}} full {{details of the}} skirmish, and of what Harold had learnt of Henry Alison's course. It had been a {{succession}} of falls lower and lower, as with each failure habits of drunkenness and dissipation fastened on him, and peculation and dishonesty on that congenial soil grew into ruffianism. [...] Expelled from the gold diggings for some act too mean even for that atmosphere, he had become {{the leader of a}} gang of runaway shepherds in the recesses of the Red Valley, and spread increasing terror there until the attack on him in his stronghold, when Harold's cousinly embrace (really intended to spare his life, {{as well as that of}} the magistrate) had absolutely injured his spine, probably for life. He had with great difficulty been carried to Sydney, and there placed in the hospital instead of the jail; since, disabled as he was, no one wished to prosecute the poor wretch, and identification was always a difficulty. Harold had been <b>taking</b> daily <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and had found him in his weak and broken state ready to soften, nay, to shed tears, at the thought of his mother; evincing feelings that might be of little service if he had recovered, but if he were crippled for life might be the beginning of better things. Harold had given him the Bible, and the stockings, and had left him alone with them. The Bible was as yet left untouched, as if he were afraid of it, but he had ever since been turning over and fondling the stockings, as though all the love that the poor mother had been knitting into them for years and years, apparently in vain, were exhaling like the heat and colours stored by the sun in ages past in our coals.|$|R

500|$|William J. Bell {{had created}} the {{character}} of Phillip Chancellor III in 1976, and he remained {{a vital part of}} the soap opera's storylines until his death onscreen in 1989. In 2007, Latham rewrote Chancellor's birth by establishing that Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Jill's enemy and Phillip Chancellor II's wife, switched their child with another hours after his birth; the character was brought back to the series as an adult named Cane Ashby, an Australian looking for his birth mother. During that time, Goddard did not want to know the real motives of his character because he did not want that to influence his performance. After the revelation that Jill was Cane's mother, his views changed, saying he [...] "now welcomed the information as it added more color to his portrayal". The initial lack of information made portraying Cane difficult since there was an amount of ambiguity over whether he was a good, bad, or mediocre character. The ambiguity deepened when Goddard read the script revealing that a DNA test performed for Jill and Cane came back negative. He stated that he had never asked Latham [...] "what was going on" [...] with the storyline, but told her that he could [...] "play anything he needed to". A second DNA test later confirmed Cane as Jill's son. Goddard also said it was [...] "too good to be true" [...] for Cane to be Jill's son, adding that, [...] "But, down the road you realize these people actually do care about you, that you can reciprocate that care. For Cane, he's had so much time without them it's pointless to have the time with them and not enjoying it." [...] Though the maternity question was answered, more ambiguity about Cane's intentions appeared as the character received a phone call from his uncle Langley that hinted about Cane scheming against Jill and Katherine. The original intent of the call was to show that Cane wanted what was owed to him after being given away as an infant. The writers changed directions after the popularity of the character grew. Goddard said he felt the phone call was resolved within the story when Cane sent money to his uncle as part of <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
