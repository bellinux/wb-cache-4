5|$|The natives' {{relationship}} with the sailors is initially cordial, so Too-Wit and the captain begin trading. Their friendliness, however, <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a ruse and {{on the eve of}} the ship's proposed departure, the natives ambush the crew in a narrow gorge. Everyone except Pym and Peters is slaughtered, and the Jane Guy is overrun and burned by the malevolent tribe.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E

30|$|Our {{main results}} can be {{summarized}} as follows. In spite of our assumption that coercive power {{can be seen to}} bring order and discipline into the relationship as well as be effective in changing behavior, the effects of coercive power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be negative on both coordination and cooperation. According to our assumptions, reward power should {{have a negative effect on}} cooperation and a positive effect on coordination. Expert power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have positive effects on coordination and cooperation. The effects of informational power are similar to the effects of expert power, though the effect in the case of informational power on cooperation is much weaker than that of expert power. According to the findings, the effects of legitimate power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be positive for coordination and negative for cooperation. One must admit, though, that in spite of the positive sign of the effect on coordination, the strength of this effect <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be weak. Referent power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have a positive effect on both coordination and cooperation.|$|R

That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, and it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be zero.|$|E
