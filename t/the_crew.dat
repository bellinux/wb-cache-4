5|$|After the battle, {{the ladies}} of Hallifax {{launched}} a subscription to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of HMS Boston. On the other hand, the population of New York had a golden medal made in honour of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of Embuscade; Bompart accepted the medal on the condition {{he would not have}} to wear it, as the National Convention had banned medals.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> {{worked through}} the {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E
5|$|At Paramount, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> filmed all {{the scenes}} {{that would take}} place on soundstages, {{including}} the Enterprise and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> shot scenes ahead of schedule. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crews</b> crafted {{routines}} that incorporated {{elements of}} classic '80s films. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> were given remixed {{versions of the}} songs from their respective movies.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{remaining}} <b>crews</b> displayed their {{mastery of}} hip hop styles from around <b>the</b> nation. One <b>crew</b> was eliminated halfway through <b>the</b> show. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> received help from three guest ABDC alumni from past seasons. Each alumnus {{was assigned to}} one of the dance styles <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> were responsible for.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crews</b> took {{inspiration}} from Britney Spears' music videos {{to create their}} routines. Andre Fuentes, Spears' choreographer, assigned additional challenges for <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> to complete.|$|R
5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> hating her for it.|$|E
5|$|CAPCOM Dan Burbank advised <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> {{that the}} damage did not {{initially}} {{appear to be}} serious, but assured <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> that the image analysis team would be reviewing the imagery further, and engineers on the ground would be analyzing it {{to determine if a}} focused inspection would be required.|$|E
5|$|Johner (Ron Perlman) is a {{crew member}} and {{mercenary}} on the Betty. After <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> boards the Auriga they encounter Number 8, whom Johner tries to seduce. She overpowers him, attacking the rest of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> as well. The Aliens escape captivity, forcing Johner {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> to collaborate with Number 8 to escape from the Auriga. When he asks Number 8 how Ellen Ripley defeated the Aliens, she replies that Ripley died. Aboard the Betty, Johner and Vriess co-pilot their damaged ship to Earth.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{showcase}} round, <b>the</b> {{top four}} <b>crews</b> are selected {{to take part}} in a crew-vs-crew battle playoff. In the semifinals, <b>the</b> top-ranked <b>crew</b> battles <b>the</b> 4th-ranked <b>crew</b> and <b>the</b> 2nd-ranked <b>crew</b> battles <b>the</b> 3rd-ranked <b>crew.</b> <b>The</b> winner of each semifinal then battle each other for the championship.|$|R

5|$|On March 11, the {{production}} filmed scenes {{set in a}} pig farm, where a young boy is confronted and attacked by three perpetrators. A night later, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> shot the film's opening sequence, in which the three civil rights workers are murdered. From March 14 to March 18, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> filmed the burning of several more churches, as well as scenes set in a farm. On March 22, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> filmed scenes set in a morgue that was located inside the University of Mississippi Medical Center, exactly the same location where the bodies of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were transported. A day later, Parker and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> filmed a scene set in a cotton field. The art department had to dress each plant with layers of cotton, as the cotton plants had not fully bloomed. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> also filmed the abduction of Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey) and his subsequent interrogation by FBI agent Monk (Badja Djola). On March 24, {{the production}} moved to Raymond, Mississippi, where <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> filmed a scene at the John Bell Williams Airport. Depicting Monk's departure, the scene was choreographed by Parker and the cast members {{so that it could}} be filmed in one take.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 23rd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of the Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, while exploring {{the center of the}} galaxy, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of the Enterprise are transported to the planet Megas-Tu by an alien named Lucien, where magic and witchcraft are normal. Kirk and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> are placed on trial by the inhabitants in response to the Salem Witch Trials.|$|E

In this episode, telepath Tam Elbrun (Harry Groener) joins <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> to investigate a bio ship detected near a star about to go supernova. As <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> investigates, the Romulans threaten the Enterprise and the creature, Gomtuu, and Elbrun boards it with Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). As the star is about to explode, Gomtuu sends Data back to the Enterprise and the two ships out of the system. Gomtuu and Elbrun leave together as the star goes supernova.|$|E
40|$|Flying {{commercial}} aircraft requires <b>the</b> <b>crew’s</b> prediction ca-pability {{to anticipate the}} future states of the world (failures, weather situation [...] .), especially those that may harm {{the safety of the}} aircraft and passengers. Incident and accident analyses and experimental {{studies have shown that the}} occur-rence of a conflict during flights (crew/system conflict, pi-lot/copilot conflict) disrupts <b>the</b> <b>crew’s</b> cognitive capabilities. Therefore the idea is to design a prediction assistant, based on a joint estimation of the state of the aircraft and of <b>the</b> <b>crew’s</b> actions, especially on the autopilot. The prediction of possible conflicting states will allow to enhance <b>the</b> <b>crew’s</b> capability to anticipate the aircraft behavior...|$|R
500|$|STS-71 docked with Mir on June 29 and {{performed}} a <b>crew</b> exchange between <b>the</b> EO-19 and EO-18 <b>crews</b> aboard <b>the</b> space station. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> of EO-18, EO-19, and STS-71 performed a ceremony inside Spacelab aboard Atlantis during which <b>the</b> ten <b>crew</b> members assembled a commemorative pewter medallion and exchanged gifts. Shortly thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> began transferring supplies and tools to Mir from Atlantis.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{like its}} {{predecessor}} in Season 3, <b>the</b> remaining four <b>crews</b> incorporated an illusion or magic act into their performance set. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> kicked off <b>the</b> {{show with a}} group performance to [...] "Take It Off" [...] by Kesha with judge Lil Mama performing in the routine. Magician Franz Harary returned as the magic instructor for <b>the</b> <b>crews.</b>|$|R

50|$|Gibson was strict in {{screening}} <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> during training. That not all <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> {{were known}} to him is reflected in how two crews were posted off the squadron as not satisfactory and another crew chose to leave after their navigator was deemed unsatisfactory.|$|R
5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> were not aware {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> was problematic, since <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the outbound track from Advent. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E

The practice of taking passengers aboard cargo ships, once almost universal, is very rare today and almost non-existent on bulkers.|$|E
5000|$|... 1 January - May 1942: Twelve {{aircraft}} of VP-82 {{were transferred}} to NAS Argentia, Newfoundland, to provide convoy coverage, harbor patrol and ASW sweeps. The squadron came under the operational control of PatWing-7 while at NAS Argentia and NAS Quonset Point. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> were berthed during this period aboard USS Pocomoke.

50|$|This week Status Quo {{received}} the most votes over JabbaWockeeZ and Kaba Modern. The last challenge was for <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> to illustrate <b>the</b> evolution of hip-hop using the same music. <b>The</b> final three <b>crews</b> had to perform to these songs using classic hip-hop moves such as Popping, Locking and Breakdancing. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> were also to dance to Pop and new jack swing.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crew</b> {{spent the}} day in {{preparations}} for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the flight control surfaces, performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to run {{through a series of}} landing simulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{ocean waters}} became calmer {{during the night}} and the Tusk was able to {{approach}} the Cochino. All of <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> {{with the exception of}} Commander Benitez and two of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> who perished during the ordeal, boarded the Tusk. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> members of the Tusk convinced Benitez to board the Tusk, which he did two minutes before the Cochino sank off the coast of Norway.|$|E

The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
