5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli.

5|$|The walrus {{has played}} a {{prominent}} role in <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber, walrus ivory, and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> ancient Greece {{and ancient}} Rome, animal {{stereotypes}} grew until {{by the time}} of Virgil, animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, Homer uses animal similes in the Iliad and the Odyssey, where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion simile {{at the end of the}} Odyssey, where in Book 22 Odysseus kills all Penelope's suitors. In the Iliad, Homer compares the Trojans to stridulating grasshoppers, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the Aeneid, Book 4, Virgil compares the world of Dido, queen of Carthage, with a colony of ants. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's {{culture has}} been {{influenced}} by traditional (Aboriginal and Métis) and modern Canadian artistic values, {{as well as by}} <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> its immigrant populations and American neighbours. The Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport is responsible for promoting and, to some extent, financing Manitoban culture. Manitoba is the birthplace of the Red River Jig, a combination of aboriginal pow-wows and European reels popular among early settlers. Manitoba's traditional music has strong roots in Métis and Aboriginal culture, in particular the old-time fiddling of the Métis. Manitoba's cultural scene also incorporates classical European traditions. The Winnipeg-based Royal Winnipeg Ballet (RWB), is Canada's oldest ballet and North America's longest continuously operating ballet company; it was granted its royal title in 1953 under Queen Elizabeth II. The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO) performs classical music and new compositions at the Centennial Concert Hall. Manitoba Opera, founded in 1969, also performs out of the Centennial Concert Hall.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{as a small}} {{settlement}} in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak evolved during the fourth millennium BC {{into one of the}} biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia, and interacted with <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> southern Mesopotamia. The city shrank in size {{at the beginning of the}} third millennium BC with the end of Uruk period, before expanding again around c. 2600 BC, when it became known as Nagar, and was the capital of a regional kingdom that controlled the Khabur river valley. Nagar was destroyed around c. 2300 BC, and came under the rule of the Akkadian Empire, followed by a period of independence as a Hurrian city-state, before contracting at the beginning of the second millennium BC. Nagar prospered again by the 19th century BC, and came under the rule of different regional powers. In c. 1500 BC, Tell Brak was a center of Mitanni before being destroyed by Assyria c. 1300 BC. The city never regained its former importance, remaining as a small settlement, and abandoned at some points of its history, until disappearing from records during the early Abbasid era.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{from the}} Post-Zarubintsy {{cultures}} and often considered the oldest Slavic culture, the Kiev culture functioned during the later Roman periods (end of 2nd through mid-5th century) {{north of the}} vast Chernyakhov culture territories, within the basins of the upper and middle Dnieper, Desna and Seym rivers. The archeological cultural features of the Kiev sites show this culture to be identical or highly compatible (representing the same cultural model) {{with that of the}} 6th-century Slavic societies, including the settlements on the lands of today's Poland. The Kiev culture is known mostly from settlement sites; the burial sites, involving pit graves, are few and poorly equipped. Not many metal objects have been found, despite the known native production of iron and processing of other metals, including enamel coating technology. Clay vessels were made without the potter's wheel. The Kiev culture represented an intermediate level of development, between that of <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> the Central European Barbaricum, and the forest zone societies of {{the eastern part of the}} continent. The Kiev culture consisted of four local formations: The Middle Dnieper group, the Desna group, the Upper Dnieper group and the Dnieper-Don group. The general model of the Kiev culture is like that of the early Slavic cultures that were to follow and must have originated mainly from the Kiev groups, but evolved probably over a larger territory, stretching west to the base of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, and from a broader Post-Zarubintsy foundation. The Kiev culture and related groups expanded considerably after 375 AD, when the Ostrogothic state, and more broadly speaking the Chernyakhov culture, were destroyed by the Huns. This process was facilitated further and gained pace, involving at that time the Kiev's descendant cultures, when the Hun confederation itself broke down in the mid-5th century.|$|E

40|$|A {{system of}} quality in an {{organization}} signifies an existence <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> on a certain level, whereas changes in the system of quality signify certain cultural changes in <b>the</b> organization. <b>The</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> quality is a factor within <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> an organization and it means the implementation of TQM (Total Quality Management) in <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization. Creating a culture is a long-term and multidisciplinary process that should result in comparative advantages for the organization at hand: lower expenditure, higher savings, more productive work, increased reputation of the organization in its surroundings and success on the market, which taken together means increased successfulness of business.

The purpose of this case study was to qualitatively examine how culture influenced faculty members' perception toward the implementation of e-learning in a university in Thailand. There were twenty-five faculty participants in this study who were purposefully selected from different disciplines. Four of twenty-five participants occupy the role of administrator and trainer in addition to their teaching responsibilities. The conceptual framework of this study follows Lechuga's faculty <b>culture,</b> which consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic discipline, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic profession, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institution, and <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Data sources included semi-structured interviews, documents, and observations. Data was analyzed using Lechuga's faculty <b>culture</b> framework. <b>The</b> key factor that emerges in <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual and <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic discipline is the faculty's familiarity with personal and instructional technologies.

The findings of this study also suggest that insufficient physical and intellectual support created dissatisfaction and frustration, distinctive among faculty members. As a result, there were more negative perceptions toward the implementation of e-learning. Finally, the findings suggest that unclear objectives and future directions of e-learning policies affect faculty members' decision to continue participating in the implementation of e-learning. The findings identified implications for improving technological preparation, e. g., ongoing and thorough training programs, and support, e. g., revision of e-learning policies, computer equipment, network, and technical and expert support within an institution...|$|R
