40|$|AIMS: To assess whereas prevalence, {{treatment}} and direct costs of drug-treated diabetes {{were similar in}} migrants and in people of Italian citizenship under the universalistic Italian health care system. METHODS AND RESULTS: Drug-treated diabetic individuals were identified in the population-based multiregional ARNO Observatory {{on the basis of}} 2010 prescriptions. Migrants were identified by the country-of-birth code on the fiscal identification code. Diabetes prevalence was calculated for Italians (n = 7, 328, 383) and migrants (n = 527, 965). To assess the odds of migrants of having diabetes compared <b>to</b> <b>Italians,</b> we individually matched all migrants <b>to</b> <b>Italians</b> for major confounders (age, sex and place of residence). Finally, all migrants with diabetes were individually matched for confounders <b>to</b> <b>Italians</b> with diabetes <b>to</b> compare prescriptions, hospitalization rates, services use and direct costs for the National Health System. We identified 368, 797 subjects with diabetes among Italians and 10, 336 among migrants, giving prevalence of 5. 03...|$|R

5|$|Despite serving {{for over}} thirty years, the ships had uneventful careers.

5|$|Despite the {{attempts}} of the Kirk {{to limit the}} tradition of secular popular music, it continued. This period saw {{the adoption of the}} highland bagpipes and the fiddle.

A musical culture developed around Edinburgh and a number of composers began to produce collections of Lowland and Highland tunes grafted on <b>to</b> <b>Italian</b> musical forms.
