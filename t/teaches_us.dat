25|$|On a {{philosophical}} level, homological algebra <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> that certain chain complexes associated with algebraic or geometric objects (topological spaces, simplicial complexes, R-modules) contain {{a lot of}} valuable algebraic information about them, with the homology being only the most readily available part. On a technical level, homological algebra provides the tools for manipulating complexes and extracting this information. Here are two general illustrations.|$|E

What! has the immortal letter, unlike all other good advice, absolutely not been thrown away? {{or is the}} jade incorrigible? Whichever be the case, you need not be silent. There is yet enough to do, and yet enough to instruct. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that wealth is not elegance; that profusion is not magnificence; and that splendour is not beauty. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that taste is a talisman which can do greater wonders than the millions of the loanmonger. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that to vie is not to rival, and to imitate not to invent. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that pretension is a bore. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that wit is excessively good-natured, and, like champagne, not only sparkles, but is sweet. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> the vulgarity of malignity. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that envy spoils our complexions, and that anxiety destroys our figure.

25|$|Historians {{agree that}} Aix was born from its sources {{of water to}} Ancient Rome, on {{the remains of a}} Celtic habitat. The first {{occupation}} of the site has been dated by Alain Canal to the first century BCE, however there is nothing to suggest these remains were a fixed habitat. We are left with the remains in public institutions and {{it would be difficult to}} draw a sketch of ancient Aquae. The administrative situation of the place is known by epigraphy, which <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> that Aix was, in the 1st century AD, a vicus, with a board of decemlecti (a council of ten members), and was administratively part of Vienne. Some citizens lived there with, apparently, quite important resources to offer to the gods, a sacred wood, a vine or to build a funeral arch for the case of the Campanii family.|$|E

[...] It is virtually impossible now to discern whether MalcolmX's personal beliefs at the time diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{reflected}} on the film's themes, writing [...] "Little Miss Sunshine shows us {{a world in which}} there's a form, a brochure, a procedure, a job title, a diet, a step-by-step program, a career path, a prize, a retirement community, to quantify, sort, categorize and process every human emotion or desire. Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or turned into a self-improvement mantra about 'winners and losers.'" [...] Brian Tallerico of UGO.com also focused on the film's themes: [...] "Little Miss Sunshine <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> to embrace that middle ground, acknowledging that life may just be a beauty pageant, where we're often going to be outdone by someone prettier, smarter, or just plain luckier, but if we get up on that stage and be ourselves, everything will turn out fine." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{discusses}} a {{wide range}} of topics in Stars, including Africa, aging and the young's misconceptions of it, sex and sensuality, self-reflection, independence, and violence.

[...] She salutes Black women, calling them [...] "precious jewels all", and profiles her friend Oprah Winfrey, who she compares to [...] "the desperate traveler who <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> the most profound lesson and affords us the most exquisite skills". [...] Angelou defends her controversial support of Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice in one of her essays. [...] In her final essay in the book, Angelou uses the story of the prodigal son to emphasize the value of solitude: [...] "In the silence we listen to ourselves. [...] Then we ask questions of ourselves. [...] We describe ourselves to ourselves, and we may even hear the voice of God." ...|$|E

500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{affirmed that}} the scene {{reestablished}} The Walking Dead to full form, {{as well as}} redeemed the season's [...] "general gutlessness thus far." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and observed that it was effective {{enough to keep the}} viewers chattering until the succeeding episode. Handlen summated: [...] "The Sophia reveal is a punch in the gut, because narrative fiction <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> the longer someone stays missing, the better the chance they'll turn up alive; otherwise, where would the drama be? By using the little girl in this way, the show transforms what should've been anti-climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline. It's not enough to make the bad parts of the earlier episodes great, but it does show that the writers had more on their mind than stalling." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger felt that albeit predictable, the segment was [...] "well executed". Josh Wigler of MTV said that the storyline ended in [...] "a much darker way than anyone could have imagined." ...|$|E
500|$|Benigno called [...] "The Most Wonderful Day of the Year" [...] a [...] "perfectly {{pleasant}} {{opening that}} the Gleeks sing while they decorate their tree". Canning deemed it [...] "the episode's most successful song" [...] {{and added that}} it [...] "would {{have been a great}} tone setter if the rest of the episode hadn't focused on heartbreak, hate and grinches". Harper said that the song [...] "got the episode off on the right holiday foot", and Stack gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that its performance [...] "almost felt like the beginning of a real holiday musical. It was a little cheesy but also kind of charming and sweet." [...] The next song, [...] "We Need a Little Christmas", Benigno declared [...] "fun but too short". He added, [...] "If there's one thing this number <b>teaches</b> <b>us,</b> it's that Mercedes is being woefully misused on this show and can carry a number as well, if not better than she can finish one." [...] Stack said that the [...] "little taste" [...] included in the show [...] "sounded promising", and Harper [...] "totally loved this song".|$|E
500|$|On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin {{presented}} Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the Légion d'honneur, at {{a ceremony}} at the French Embassy in London. [...] De Villepin praised Pinter's poem [...] "American Football" [...] (1991) stating: [...] "With its violence and its cruelty, {{it is for me}} one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence." [...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E

500|$|... "Yodel It!", {{which is}} {{two minutes and}} 56 seconds in length, was made {{available}} for digital download on the iTunes Store on 30 January 2017 by Cat Music. On the same date, the label uploaded an audio video for the track to its YouTube channel. [...] "Yodel It!" [...] was also included on the [...] compilation, which was released on 21 April 2017 and featured the 43 participating entries. Alexandru eventually remixed the song and stretched it to three minutes and 41 seconds. An English language track, [...] "Yodel It!" [...] combines rock with pop and hip hop music. Ilinca yodels prominently during the chorus, while Florea provides rap vocals. The song runs at a moderate tempo of 87 beats per minute. Bogdan Honciuc from Wiwibloggs likened its lyrical message to that of Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off" [...] (2014), as [...] "Ilinca <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> to break free from the daily doom and gloom, but she suggests yodeling our hearts out instead of shaking it off". The song's instrumental was sent to specialists in Sweden to remaster prior to the duo's appearance at the Eurovision Grand Final in Kiev.|$|E
500|$|SFScope's Sarah Stegall {{praised the}} writers for {{showcasing}} Peter, believing Jackson gave [...] "a solid, convincing performance that <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> more about Peter than {{we learned in}} the first half of this season". She also was pleased with Peter's reactions to the obstacles thrown in his path, but criticized the writing for having another man behind the murders ('Too much coincidence. Way too much coincidence. From a plotting standpoint, it was clumsy'). Stegall concluded her review by praising all of the actors' performances, explaining that other than the [...] "clumsy" [...] killer plot twist, [...] "I had no complaints at all about this episode. The supporting cast was top notch". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed how the episode mystery was processed from Peter's point of view, and loved the revelation at the end about Walternate. MTV columnist Josh Wigler praised the episode's [...] "pretty mature storytelling" [...] for not making Peter [...] "go on an angry rampage" [...] or become [...] "an angsty ball of self-loathing" [...] after the previous episode's events. He continued, [...] "You can see that he's hurting, but he's still not quite sure how to process everything. Excellent work from the writers and Joshua Jackson".|$|E
500|$|James M. Redfield, a {{classics}} {{professor at}} the University of Chicago, in his article [...] "An Aristotelian Analysis of Miss Moppet" [...] finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle's Poetics, with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes {{the outcome of the}} plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet [...] "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is [...] "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twice—to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape her—and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to read aloud to a child ("This is the mouse..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story—dangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the cat—Potter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing [...] "us that teasing is a kind of loving when {{it is a kind of}} teaching. The poet plays with us, and by taking us through an unreal experience, <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> what it is to live in the real world." ...|$|E

500|$|By this logic, market-based {{solutions}} to ecological crises (ecological economics, environmental economics, green economy) are rejected as technical tweaks {{that do not}} confront capitalism's structural failures. [...] "Low-risk" [...] technology/science-based solutions such as solar power, sustainable agriculture, and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient. [...] "High-risk" [...] technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected. Attempts made by businesses to [...] "greenwash" [...] their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as Walmart's proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption, viz. further economic growth. Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable. Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large-scale change: [...] "History <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens." [...] They also note that, up until the event of total ecological collapse, destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).|$|E
