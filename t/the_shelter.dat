40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the uneven façade design on energy consumption from a integrated perspective. The computer simulation techniques were adopted to assess the effects of <b>the</b> façade <b>sheltering</b> sizes on <b>the</b> total energy consumption. To facilitate the model establishment, some scripts are written by MATLAB. The simulation results indicate that <b>the</b> façade <b>sheltering</b> generally makes <b>the</b> energy consumption increase, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>sheltering</b> types. And <b>the</b> influence range of <b>the</b> <b>sheltering</b> on <b>the</b> total energy consumption relates closely to <b>the</b> <b>sheltering</b> condition and <b>the</b> façade window position...|$|R
50|$|In general, {{there are}} two types of engravings, showing linear {{illustrations}} of bowls and cups, appear inside seven of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> Only four of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> contain this one type of bowl and cup engravings while other categories of engravings appear alongside the paintings in other shelters. Bowl and cup engravings have also been discovered outside <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> on horizontal surface areas.|$|R
5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> of tallish vegetation, and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E
5|$|Reaching Nemasket, Standish {{planned a}} night {{attack on the}} wigwam in which Corbitant was {{believed}} to be sleeping. That night, he and Hobbamock burst into <b>the</b> <b>shelter,</b> shouting for Corbitant. As frightened Pokanokets attempted to escape, Englishmen outside the wigwam fired their muskets, wounding a Pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to Plymouth to be treated. Standish soon learned that Corbitant had already fled the village and Tisquantum was unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{typically}} had {{a tripod}} foremast with a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they {{were similar to}} the larger s that immediately preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> deck aft.|$|E
30|$|An {{unintended}} {{benefit of}} <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> was detected after some informal visitor surveys elicited comments that <b>the</b> shading and <b>sheltering</b> (from rain) has increased visitor comfort, while the diffused light provided by <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> improves <b>the</b> legibility of the site, {{resulting in an}} enhanced visitor experience [10].|$|R

Some of the youth in the film have jobs that keep them until after <b>the</b> <b>shelter's</b> curfew. <b>The</b> main problem with <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> as it is made expressly clear in the film, is capacity. Homeless teenagers outnumber shelters by thousands.|$|R
5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian {{children}}, persecuted for their faith {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> of a cave where they slept for more than 200 years. Donne, one of six or seven children and a baptised Catholic during a time of strong anti-Catholic sentiment from both the populace and the government, would certainly have been familiar with the story.|$|E
5|$|Because the Goathouse Refuge offers their 300 cats (number as of January 2013) medical {{treatment}} on-site, quality food, toys and comfort {{items such as}} lots of blankets, the cost of maintaining {{is higher than the}} average shelter. Contributors help in many ways to <b>the</b> <b>shelter,</b> including providing items the cats need, donating money, or attending fundraisers. Scarpa's fundraisers use themes such as Burrito Bash, Venetian Carnival, Garden Gourmands, and Mad Hatter's Tea Party. These events are listed in such online and written publications as Raleigh's Indy Week, Chatham County's Chatham Chatlist, Chapel Hill's The Daily Tar Heel {{as well as on the}} Refuge's website and Facebook page.|$|E
5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 {{had been exposed to}} more than 0.1 roentgens, but <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis " Supervision {{as a tool}} {{of support}} for workers of dosshouses in the Czech Republic" is looking into supervision as the important form of support for workers who offer the Social Support work directly to homeless persons in <b>the</b> <b>Shelters</b> according to § 63 108 / 2006. It describes in detail the work offered, focusing on the organisational structure of <b>the</b> <b>Shelters</b> and <b>the</b> competence of workers within. It points out the problem situations which commonly occur in <b>the</b> <b>Shelters</b> while Social service is offered within <b>the</b> <b>Shelters</b> in <b>the</b> Czech Republic and asks the question whether the supervision sorts these problems out.

5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island.

5|$|Jacobs are {{typically}} hardy, low-maintenance animals with a naturally high resistance to parasites and hoof problems. Jacobs {{do not show}} much flocking behaviour. They can be skittish if not used to people, although with daily handling they will become tame and make good pets. They require shelter from extreme temperatures, but <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> can be open and simple. They tend to thrive in extremes of heat and cold and have good or excellent foraging capabilities. They can secure adequate nutrition with minimal to no supplementation, even {{in the presence of}} suboptimal soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>shelters</b> {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> Floors {{are made from}} tread plate, although newer shelters now use concrete. <b>The</b> <b>shelters</b> are equipped with platform screen doors. Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach <b>the</b> boarding <b>shelters.</b> <b>The</b> floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the tread plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the tread plate surfaces. Another problem {{is that some of the}} tread plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b>|$|R

5|$|Logan Moore is {{a troubled}} 14-year-old boy {{living with his}} mother Marianne and {{stepfather}} Robert in Newburg, Oregon. Logan does not get along well with Robert or his mother, and holds a grudge against his biological father for leaving when he was young. After an incident at a barbecue, Robert decides to purchase a Labrador Retriever in order to teach Logan responsibility. Eager to rebel against his stepfather, Logan convinces his mother to adopt a dog from an animal shelter. He plans to choose an ugly dog and teach it destructive behavior. At <b>the</b> <b>shelter,</b> Logan encounters a young female mutt who immediately takes a liking to him. Logan adopts the dog and names her Jack after Robert's former dog.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this project, are general about {{sandwich}} structures. A sandwich construction, consist of two plate outsides (facings) glued to a core in the middle. Sandwiches are used in construction that must have a low weight, but a high stiffness. This indicated racing cars, aeroplane, ship shelters. To understand a sandwich construction, the basis, is to understand the sandwich beam. The are given a short description to find the deflection of the beam. The rest of this project, regards the calculation of a homogeneous, isotropic sandwich <b>shelters.</b> <b>The</b> objective is to reduce the mass of 20 ft sandwich shelters from TAM AS. The background for this project, was the article: “Optimal Stiffness Design Plates with Variable Core Densities”. When we use, the methods described in this article, we find the inverse stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> and from this optimal facings thickness, shear modulus for the core material and d, to reduce the weight of <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> <b>The</b> optimization are do it graphically. In the optimized of <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> only <b>the</b> walls are optimized, because the roof and floor is not symmetrical. When we optimize the parameters, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> can be reduce with 43. 2 kg. This are approximately 7. 3 %. To verify the calculation of the inverse stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>shelters,</b> <b>the</b> deflection of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> was calculated both analytical and numerical with four random pressures.
