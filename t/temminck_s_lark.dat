40|$|We {{developed}} twenty microsatellite markers for the Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark</b> (Chersophilus duponti), one of {{the most}} endangered European bird species, and tested in two related, more widely distributed species: crested lark (Galerida cristata) and thekla lark (Galerida theklae). 14 markers amplified and were polymorphic in Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark,</b> 11 in crested lark and 6 in thekla lark. Microsatellite var- iability analyses were carried out on Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark</b> (N = 23 – 28 individuals), crested lark (N = 9 – 10) and thekla lark (N = 14) populations in NE Spain showing moderate/high diversity, ranging from 1 to 13 alleles per locus. The mean allelic richness in Dupont’s lark was 6. 21 and expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0. 195 to 0. 848 and from 0. 071 to 0. 889, respectively. Crested and thekla larks showed moderate/high diversity with a mean allelic richness of 4. 36 and 4. 67, respectively. This microsatellite set could be useful for population genetic studies of lark species widely differing in popula- tion fragmentation and conservation status across the Old World. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Former county {{commissioner}} Joseph [...] "Butch" [...] Thompson {{filed a lawsuit}} against the Board of Education on May 31, 2005. The lawsuit charged that Cobb voters did not specifically authorize the program in the 2003 SPLOST vote. On July 29, 2005, Superior Court Judge <b>S.</b> <b>Lark</b> Ingram mandated the Board of Education to use technology funds as specified in SPLOST II and ordered a permanent injunction to halt the Power to Learn initiative. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted Ingram, [...] "The ruling {{had nothing to do with}} the merits of the program. But fair notice of such use was not given to the public when the referendum for sales tax was held." [...] Board chair Kathleen Johnstone announced on August 1 that the laptop program [...] "was no longer an option." [...] The board voted on August 25, 2005, to appeal the ruling, which was thrown out by the Georgia Supreme Court.|$|R

40|$|Under {{the first}} name Dr. Sharpe {{describes}} (Proc. Z. S. L. 1888, p. 270) a small flycatcher, a single specimen collected by Mr. L. Wray in the principal mountain range of Perak (Mt. Ulu Batang Padang, 4200 f. h.). This specimen was marked »adult male”, but Mr. Sharpe adds: »it {{may not be the}} fully adult of its species, but I believe it to be so” and remarks further: »the reddish upper tailcoverts and tail remind one of the female of M. maculata, but the blue-grey upper surface distinguishes it at a glance. ” The relationship is here correctly pointed out, for the typespecimen of M. Westermanni is undoubtedly not an »adult male” but an »adult female”, as proved by Dr. Sharpe himself on a pair of flycatchers collected by Mr. Whitehead on the Kina Balu. About these two birds Dr. Sharpe says (Ibis 1888, p. 385) : »I cannot see any difference between this male bird and specimens from the Himalayas (M. maculata Tick.). The bird Mr. Whitehead sends as the female is undoubtedly the same as my M. Westermanni, so that if those two birds are sexes of one species, the latter may have to be separated on the females alone, while M. Westermanni (»female”!) is certainly different from any Himalayan specimen of M. maculata. ” Species in which the males are precisely alike and which can be only distinguished by differences in the colours of the female, may always be considered as rather doubtful, and this as more if these differences are so slight as between the females of M. melaholeuca and of the socalled M. Westermanni. The more grey tone {{on the back of the}} latter, scarcely to be termed »blue-grey”, is seen in freshly moulted females, as in the specimen (N° 14) in our Museum from the highlands of Luzon. Other females from Java (N° 8), already specifically separated by <b>Temminck</b> <b>s.</b> n. Muscicapa Hasselti, and from Timor, show the upper surface more brownish grey and agree perfectly with Dr. Sharpe’s description of the female of M. maculata from Sikkim (Cat. B. Brit. M. IV, p. 207). As in many other similarly coloured species the colouring of the back varies therefore somewhat. So Mr. Oates notices: »females from Manipur are commonly much darker than such from the Indian peninsula”, and Mr. Grant likewise says (Ibis 1896, p. 540) : »upper parts of females from Negros are of a rather darker grey than in Luzon specimens. ...|$|R
