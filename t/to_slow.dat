5|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of 12 Navy vessels <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> down the British fleet that was invading New York from Canada. The British fleet did destroy Arnold's fleet, but the U.S. fleet managed <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> down the British after a two-day battle, known as the Battle of Valcour Island, and managed <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> the progression of the British Army. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging {{up to and including}} the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E

5|$|Australia scored slowly, as Yardley {{employed}} leg theory <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> the scoring. Brown {{came in at}} No. 5, but he {{had played}} {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24. Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs.|$|E

5|$|Between September26 and 27, {{the storm}} {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> while turning northwestward. Its wind field became asymmetric {{during the afternoon}} of September26, with hurricane-force winds present only in the eastern side. Later in the day, winds around the center increased to 110mph (175km/h), just short of major hurricane status. The possibility of rapid intensification {{at the time was}} low.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 21 August, tanks of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had linked with Polish forces at Coudehard, and the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry {{divisions}} had secured St. Lambert and the northern passage to Chambois; the Falaise pocket had been sealed. Approximately 20–50,000 German troops, minus heavy equipment, escaped through the gap and were reorganized and rearmed, in time <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> the Allied advance into the Netherlands and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Consequences of this {{include the}} time–space frame of a moving body {{appearing}} <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> down and contract (in {{the direction of}} motion) when measured {{in the frame of}} the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether the}} cue-locked centroparietal positivity {{is associated with}} switch-specific or general preparation processes. If this positivity (300 – 400 ms) indexes switch-specific preparation, faster switch trials associated with smaller RT switch cost should have a larger positivity as compared <b>to</b> <b>slower</b> switch trials, but no such association should be evident for repeat trials. We extracted ERP waveforms corresponding to semi-deciles of each participant's RT distribution (i. e., fastest <b>to</b> <b>slowest</b> 5 % of trials) for switch and repeat conditions. Consistent with a switch-specific preparation process, centroparietal positivity amplitude was linked <b>to</b> <b>slower</b> RT and larger RT switch cost for switch but not repeat trials. A later pre-target negativity (500 – 600 ms) was inversely correlated with RT for both switch and repeat trials, consistent with a general anticipatory preparation processes...|$|R
5|$|During the storm, the Weather Channel {{web site}} {{experienced}} substantially increased traffic.

Deuterium (hydrogen-2) {{is used in}} nuclear fission applications as a moderator <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> neutrons, and in nuclear fusion reactions.

5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of catching a whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London. At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined on a bed covers. Though as he reads, he begins <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> up as he begins to drop off.

5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors may act {{as part of}} a {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of the}} pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's bow shock, {{where the}} {{magnetosphere}} begins <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> the solar wind, occurs {{at a distance}} of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies {{at a distance of}} 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.|$|E
