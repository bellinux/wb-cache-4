5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> {{eagle ray}} has many {{different}} common names, including white-spotted eagle ray, bonnet skate, bonnet ray, duckbill ray and spotted duck-billed ray.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> {{green pigeon}} {{was shown to}} be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. The genetic {{distance}} between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> green pigeon was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> green pigeon. The possibility that <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena is {{a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. <b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> turtle {{and painted}} turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference between it and <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> turtle is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> {{green pigeon}} was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> green pigeon {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} some very careful readers; the ornithologist Alfred Newton noticed that Rennie had used an {{identical}} paragraph to describe two birds, the beam bird (now called <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> flycatcher) and the pied flycatcher, though their descriptions were separated by 300 pages.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Great Red <b>Spot</b> varies {{greatly in}} hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> {{occasionally}} [...] "disappears", becoming evident only through <b>the</b> Red <b>Spot</b> Hollow, which is its {{niche in the}} South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Interestingly, its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> tends to be dark, {{and when it is}} dark, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> is usually light. These periods when <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; as of 1997, during the preceding 50 years, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> was darkest in the periods 1961–1966, 1968–1975, 1989–1990, and 1992–1993.|$|R

5|$|The dorsal spots make <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> {{eagle ray}} an {{aquarium}} attraction, although {{because of its}} large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> eagle ray, but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of spotted eagle rays leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, spotted eagle rays do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid human contact. Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three spotted eagle rays. The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the eagle ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> eagle ray.|$|E
5|$|The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It {{is scarce}} or absent in {{tropical}} rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, {{it occurs in}} riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena outnumbers other large carnivores, including other hyena species. However, the striped and brown hyena occur at greater densities than <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> {{green pigeon}} {{is most likely}} extinct, and may already have been close to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area. The species may have disappeared due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals. Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.|$|E
50|$|The roll yield is {{the yield}} that a futures {{investor}} captures as their long {{position in a}} futures contract converges to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> price; in a backwardated futures market the price rolls up to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> price, so <b>the</b> roll yield is positive, whereas when the market is in contango the price rolls down to <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> price, so <b>the</b> roll yield is negative. <b>The</b> <b>spot</b> price can stay constant, but the investor will still earn returns from buying discounted futures contracts, which continuously roll up to <b>the</b> constant <b>spot</b> price.|$|R
50|$|Other {{settlement}} dates are also possible. Standard {{settlement dates}} are calculated from <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date. For example, a one-month foreign exchange forward settles {{one month after}} <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date. I.e., if today is 1 February, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date is 3 February and the one-month date is 3 March (assuming these dates are all business days). For a trade with two dates, such as a foreign exchange swap, the first date is usually taken as <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> date.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena has a {{long history}} of {{interaction}} with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena is {{the most}} {{carnivorous}} member of the Hyaenidae. Unlike its brown and striped cousins, <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena is a predator, not a scavenger; this has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by Hans Kruuk, an African wildlife ecologist, and he showed through a 7-year study of hyena populations in Africa that spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions, and with later studies this {{has been shown to}} be the average in all areas of Africa. However spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers, often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena is {{the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena {{can be traced}} back to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest are {{the most}} {{commonly}} taken medium-sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked {{due to differences in}} habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and impala are <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and roan antelope carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and impala. In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, impala, giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.|$|E

5|$|Bosman and Kolben's {{descriptions}} went largely unnoticed until 1771, {{when the}} Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, {{as well as}} his personal experience with a captive specimen, as a basis for consistently differentiating <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena from the striped. The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena {{is usually}} portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised {{the differences between}} <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> and striped hyena.

During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market demand exceeds a threshold size, this situation is reversed, and the supplier with no contracts benefits more from making <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market more prevalent. We show that a supplier with forward contracts benefits from the existence of <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> market more than a supplier with no contracts and that this result holds with both negative and positive correlation between spot market demand and contracted demand.
