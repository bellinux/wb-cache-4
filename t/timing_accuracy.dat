5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with more emphasis on the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom. The adventure follows Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi while they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an alien species only known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on <b>timing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot and themes.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the <b>timing</b> <b>accuracy</b> of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party {{will not be able}} to defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with its}} sales, the game {{received}} mixed reviews from various gaming critics. Both the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions earned their own aggregated scores of 57/100 and 56/100 on Metacritic, 60.37% and 57.86% on GameRankings respectively. Chris Roper of IGN found the Super Battle Trial {{to be the}} most interesting part of the game, though he would complain about the presentation of the story arcs in the Dragon Battle Collection mode, the gaming mechanics, and the camera. Gambus Kahn of ZTGameDomain, who reviewed the PlayStation 3 version, had mixed feelings over the fighting system, claiming that it was both awesome and a pain, as most of the controls are utilized during play and the right analog stick was used as another set of buttons functions, making it appear convoluted. Khan went on to complain about the <b>timing</b> <b>accuracy</b> in which a player has to block both grabbing and Ki attacks, which he compares as being tougher than the <b>timing</b> <b>accuracy</b> in Street Fighter IV. Although he loved the game's depth, claiming that it [...] "plays unlike any non-Dragon Ball game before", he stated that it had the feel of a very fast paced Armored Core game. Arnold Katayev of PSXtream felt that the game mechanics were not very deep. He called the multiplayer mode the best thing about the game, while complaining that the dialogue was not taken straight from the anime.|$|E

2500|$|Compared {{to single}} data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM {{interface}} makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict {{control of the}} timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required <b>timing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name [...] "double data rate" [...] refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.|$|E

30|$|At {{the same}} time, the higher {{bandwidth}} constrains the delay accuracy in BH/FH due to significantly reduced sample duration, which is {{directly proportional to}} the bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract. As a {{cause of}} {{possible}} uncertainty of the pulsar time scale, we investigated the gravitational time delay due to {{the motion of the}} intervening stars and MACHOs. We calculated the amplitudes of cubic, quartic and quintic trends in the residual of the times of arrival (TOA) of the pulse from pulsar due to gravitational time delay. It is shown that the cubic trend becomes dominant when the <b>timing</b> measurement <b>accuracy</b> is relatively high, say higher than 10 micro second at the case of the intervening star’s mass is 1 M⊙. The optical depth of three trends are shown as a function of TOA residual. The optical depth for detecting the cubic trend is approximately proportional to the 2 / 3 th power of the mass over the <b>timing</b> measurement <b>accuracy,</b> and to the square of the observational period. Typical order of this optical depth is 0. 1 for a pulsar of a few kpc distance and observed over 10 years with the <b>timing</b> measurement <b>accuracy</b> of 10 ns...|$|R

The direct-sequence spread spectrum signals are transmitted from GPS satellites whose orbital position and timing (the ephemeris data) are accurately known.
