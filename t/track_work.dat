5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test <b>Track.</b> <b>Work</b> inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the system}} took more than 2,000 {{professional}} engineers from 20 countries and over 20,000 foreign and domestic workers six years to complete. Construction work was broken into several specialized lots that were contracted separately. One group of contracts was for civil works, covering {{the construction of the}} superstructure of open line sections. Stations and depots were the subject of separate groups of construction lots. A fourth group of lots was for <b>track</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|The AirportLink {{provides}} a reliable transit {{connection to the}} airport {{for the millions of}} residents, visitors and employees who travel to and from MIA every year. With this project, Miami-Dade County joins the many major metropolitan areas around the world with rapid transit connections to their airports. In June 2011, when the Metrorail portion of the project was 81% complete, the project end date was slated as April 29, 2012. As of January 2012, the AirportLink <b>track</b> <b>work</b> was 100% complete, the substations have been electrified and load testing with two-car trains has commenced.|$|E

25|$|Following {{completion}} of a major <b>track</b> <b>work</b> project in December 2006, journey times on the line were cut by about 10minutes. Currently major track replacement work is under way on the London Underground parts of the line, to increase maximum speeds.|$|E

25|$|In July 2016, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board {{approved}} a $18.5 million contract to complete work along {{the remainder of}} the southern branches. The work includes all remaining third rail replacement, <b>track</b> <b>work</b> between Fields Corner and Savin Hill, signal system work between North Quincy and Braintree, and track replacement at Quincy Center, Quincy Adams, and Braintree.

25|$|On Saturday 18 September reopening ceremonies were held, with Sunday 19 September {{being the}} first day of normal {{passenger}} services. The cost of reopening the line was about $21.6 million, of which KiwiRail contributed $10 million for <b>track</b> <b>work</b> and ARTA $3.6 million for three stations. The ARC also used $8 million to buy the site for the Onehunga station, where a 60-space park and ride facility was to open one week after the train services began.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., {{virtually}} all rail networks and infrastructure outside the Northeast Corridor are privately owned by freight lines. Passenger lines, primarily Amtrak, operate as tenants on the freight lines. Consequently, operations must be closely synchronized and coordinated between {{freight and passenger}} railroads, with passenger trains often being dispatched by the host freight railroad. Due to this shared system, both are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and may follow the AREMA recommended practices for <b>track</b> <b>work</b> and AAR standards for vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Amtrak {{announced}} that it would stop service to the station in 1988. The final Amtrak train stopped at the station on April 7, 1991, upon the completion of the Empire Connection, which allowed trains from Albany, Toronto, and Montreal to use Penn Station. Previously, travelers had to change stations via subway, bus, or cab. Since then, Grand Central has exclusively served Metro-North Railroad, although Amtrak temporarily operated three weekday roundtrip Empire Service trains in Summer 2017 to accommodate <b>track</b> <b>work</b> at Penn Station.|$|E
25|$|On 30 August, a {{thoroughbred}} racehorse at Randwick Racecourse {{returned a}} preliminary positive test for EI, although {{did not have}} any symptoms of infection. <b>Track</b> <b>work</b> was cancelled and the stables were locked down. Tests confirmed that eight race horses in the stable had EI and the racecourse was quarantined for two months. This brought the number of confirmed infections to 488 on 41 properties, plus another 1,646 suspected infections on 100 properties. The first infection in Brisbane was confirmed, increasing the number of quarantine zones in Queensland to five.|$|E
25|$|During 2008, {{the company}} began {{construction}} of the passing loop at Thuxton station to allow hourly departures from Dereham and Wymondham. Preparatory works were carried out late in 2008 and {{the first phase of}} work; installing the southern turn out commenced during January 2009, this was completed on schedule during February of the same year. Panels of track for the loop were laid, levelled and ballasted and the both turn outs installed by the end of 2009. The final major task on the <b>track</b> <b>work</b> will see the level crossing widened to accommodate the double track.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, major {{construction}} commenced at {{the four}} stations in Berlin, Meriden, Wallingford, and Hartford. On August 3, 2015, Amtrak began busing weekday morning and evening Shuttle trains to allow double <b>tracking</b> <b>work</b> to begin.|$|R

25|$|Rail {{corrugation}} is {{a common}} issue with transit systems due to {{the high number of}} light-axle, wheel passages which result in grinding of the wheel/rail interface. Since maintenance may overlap with operations, maintenance windows (nighttime hours, off-peak hours, altering train schedules or routes) must be closely followed. In addition, passenger safety during maintenance work (inter-track fencing, proper storage of materials, <b>track</b> <b>work</b> notices, hazards of equipment near states) must be regarded at all times. At times, maintenance access problems can emerge due to tunnels, elevated structures, and congested cityscapes. Here, specialized equipment or smaller versions of conventional maintenance gear are used.|$|E
25|$|Several other entities, {{including}} the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the Partnership for New York City, and the New York League of Conservation Voters, supported the proposed congestion pricing. The MTA, in particular, {{would benefit from}} the proposal; its accelerated Capital Plan for 2008–2013 details transit investments that revenue from congestion pricing would pay for. These include 44 subway station rehabilitations, increased bus service, new Select Bus Service bus rapid transit in all 5 boroughs, $40 million for suburban park and ride facilities, Metro-North and LIRR station rehabilitations, third <b>track</b> <b>work,</b> East Side Access, Second Avenue Subway, and Fulton Center.|$|E
25|$|After {{overnight}} <b>track</b> <b>work</b> to fix {{problems with}} the track at turn 10, the race started with Hamilton holding his lead and all the cars making it through the first corner. Hamilton built up a lead of over 5 seconds over Robert Kubica before Adrian Sutil had a gearbox failure on the 16th lap and parked his car after turn 3. Sutil's car was off the track but after it caught fire the safety car was brought out, {{and there was a}} rush of drivers into the pits as all of the six lead drivers went in for their pit stops. Hamilton led Räikkönen and Kubica into the pitlane but Räikkönen took the lead as they left their garages, with Kubica alongside him and Hamilton behind.|$|E
