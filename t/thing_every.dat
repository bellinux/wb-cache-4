5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such a lovely <b>thing</b> <b>every</b> day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Cagney {{undertook}} one of {{his very}} rare television roles, starring in Robert Montgomery's Soldiers From the War Returning. This was a favor to Montgomery, who needed a strong fall season opener to stop the network from dropping his series. Cagney's appearance ensured {{that it was a}} success. The actor made it clear to reporters afterwards that television was not his medium: [...] "I do enough work in movies. This is a high-tension business. I have tremendous admiration for the people who go through this sort of <b>thing</b> <b>every</b> week, but it's not for me." ...|$|E
500|$|On Folie à Deux, Fall Out Boy {{continued}} its pattern of musical experimentation that {{began on the}} band's previous album, Infinity on High. Singer/guitarist Patrick Stump was once again the primary composer, and attempted to create compositions that echoed the themes discussed in Wentz's lyrics. As the lyrical content shifted in new directions from the group's previous works, the musical style employed by the other band members evolved as well. On this topic, Trohman commented [...] "It's not like we said, 'We want to push the envelope,' It's not that at all. We just wanted to try cooler things. The album still sounds like Fall Out Boy. It has big choruses. But you can't do the same <b>thing</b> <b>every</b> record." ...|$|E

In the same interview, Doyle described the key to their success: [...] "This band is going somewhere... it's not the same <b>thing</b> <b>every</b> night, unlike many bands, the arrangements change." [...] Reviewers were enthusiastic about the band's performances; according to Gardiner, [...] "The impression they now generate on stage is one of total energy... energy which sets them apart." [...] Juke Magazine called them [...] "a band that could reward its audiences with (the) sheer exhilaration of seeing real master musicians... taking their audiences to virgin territory that other explorers had only dreamed about." ...|$|E
500|$|Musicians such as singer Phil Anselmo {{and drummer}} Gene Hoglan cite Hell Awaits as an influence. Anselmo—known {{for his work}} with Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual—explained in an {{interview}} with D. X. Ferris, author of the book about the album Reign in Blood, that [...] "Hell Awaits just holds the entire <b>thing.</b> <b>Every</b> bit of everything to do with heavy music. [...] are gods, the best band from California, for sure." [...] Norwegian musician Frode Sivertsen (also known as [...] "E. N. Death"), former member of the black metal band Gehenna, says the song [...] "Hell Awaits" [...] and Slayer's music in general has influenced him as a musician, ranking the album in his top five. Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Damageplan picked [...] "At Dawn They Sleep" [...] among his 12 Favorite Tunes in the March 1993 issue of Guitar World, stating that Slayer taught him [...] "how to play with guts and aggression".|$|E
500|$|... "Over There" [...] {{marks the}} first time Olivia meets Fauxlivia. Their meeting {{was one of the first}} scenes to be shot; this caused Anna Torv to be anxious about her new character's traits [...] "coming across", as she had not yet {{developed}} all her mannerisms for Fauxlivia. While filming the conversation between the two, they did not use a double; Torv memorized the timing and where she should be looking and pointing her gun, and the characters were filmed one at a time. Torv commented about the scene, [...] "You're talking to air. Learning both sides... was tough." [...] For the fight scene that followed, Torv had to block and aim her gun carefully while being mindful of her movements and the camera's location—though she was aided by stunt doubles. Torv credits the crew for successfully completing the scene: [...] "I give them all the credit in the world. It took a while. They had to change the makeup, change the clothes, change the hair, change every little <b>thing,</b> <b>every</b> time they [...] the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|Comedy Central {{originally}} ordered {{only six}} episodes of South Park {{for the first}} season's initial run. However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the <b>thing</b> <b>every</b> third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing. That was part of what we wanted (to say). I think kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparation was extensive: first Grohl had {{his usual}} start-off by {{developing}} demos with drummer Taylor Hawkins, {{but for the}} first time Grohl tried to input vocals and lyrics in this early composition stage. After rounding up composition with guitarist Chris Shiflett and bassist Nate Mendel, Grohl spent two weeks with Norton discussing [...] "arrangements, harmony and melody" [...] and reducing the song ideas, and then the band spent four weeks rehearsing, playing [...] "a song a day, from noon to midnight". Hawkins stated that [...] "we basically played each of these songs 100 different times, trying every little <b>thing</b> <b>every</b> different way" [...] and that it was the first time since The Colour and the Shape [...] "that Dave had to deal with someone in the room questioning all his ideas", given the more laid-back approach of previous producer Nick Raskulinecz. Grohl claimed the choices were for the [...] "most powerful, dramatic songs", and that there was an effort to [...] "make everything sound as natural as possible – just like on the albums we grew up listening to", citing 1970s artists such as Neil Young and Wings as a major influence. Shiflett added that for the first time he played lead guitar in some tracks while Grohl [...] "usually works out all the bits" [...] of composition.|$|E
