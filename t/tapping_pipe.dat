40|$|Abstract A "cluster" of {{patients}} {{refers to the}} geographic proximity of unrelated patients with the same disease and suggests a common environmental cause for that disease. Clusters {{of patients}} with Crohn's disease {{have been linked to}} the presence of an infectious microorganism in unpasteurized milk and cheese, untreated water supplied by wells or springs, animal manure used as fertilizer for family vegetable gardens, and bodies of water contaminated by agricultural runoff. Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the suspected cause of Crohn's disease. MAP causes a disease in dairy cows and other animals that is similar to Crohn's disease, called Johne's ('Yo-knees') disease or paratuberculosis. Dairy cows with Johne's disease secrete MAP into their milk and excrete MAP into their feces. MAP is present in untreated water such as well water, in bodies of water contaminated by agricultural runoff, and in unpasteurized milk and cheese. The "treatment" of "tap" water to make it "drinkable" or "potable" by the processes of sedimentation, filtration and chlorination has little to no effect on MAP. MAP is so resistant to chlorine disinfection that such disinfection actually selects for its growth. Other subspecies of Mycobacterium avium grow in biofilms present on <b>tap</b> water <b>pipes.</b> Despite the documented presence of MAP in tap water and its probable growth on <b>tap</b> water <b>pipes,</b> clusters of Crohn's disease have not previously been described in relationship to <b>tap</b> water <b>pipes</b> supplying patients' homes. This report describes three unrelated individuals who lived on the same block along a street in a midwestern American city and developed Crohn's disease within four years of each other in the 1960 's. A common <b>tap</b> water <b>pipe</b> supplied their homes. This is the first reported cluster of Crohn's disease possibly linked to fully treated drinking water, and is consistent with previously reported clusters of Crohn's disease linked to an infectious microorganism in water. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cast {{iron and}} steel alloys are {{commonly}} used for tooling and structural components in Al production, Al die-casting and the aluminizing industry due to their favourable properties including high strength, good formability and low cost. However, the iquid Al corrosion of these materials {{is one of the}} crucial concerns in maintaining the efficient production. Al is produced by the electrolytic smelting of alumina. Cast iron and/or cast steel pipes - commonly known as „tapping pipes‟ - are used to extract the liquid Al produced by smelting. <b>Tapping</b> <b>pipes</b> mainly degrade by material loss because liquid Al reacts with nearly all metals. Failure of <b>tapping</b> <b>pipes</b> is a significant contributor to the maintenance expenses; therefore, the primary aim of this research is to develop a material to enhance the life time of <b>tapping</b> <b>pipes.</b> Various test methods were developed in order to examine the effect of molten Al environment on cast {{iron and steel}} alloys. The corrosion resistance of these alloys was determined under different conditions of Al flow and temperature. The intermetallic compounds formed by exposing the ferrous to liquid Al were characterized using the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The formation, growth and nature of reaction products were revealed to establish a link to the liquid Al corrosion resistance. A relationship between the chemical composition and liquid Al corrosion resistance of cast irons could not established in the past. In the present work, the corrosion rate was found to depend upon the graphite morphology and fraction of each Fe-C phase of cast iron matrix, which can be controlled by selecting the chemical composition. Moreover, present research suggested the guidelines for producing a cast iron with enhanced liquid Al corrosion resistance. The presence of C-rich phases, graphite flakes and cementite was found to be effective in enhancing the liquid Al corrosion resistance of gray cast irons. Conversely, a higher Si content was found to enhance the susceptibility of cast irons to liquid Al corrosion. The corrosion mechanisms for ferrous alloys in liquid Al are not fully understood. Thus the subsequent analysis of the dissolution data was supported by investigating the reaction products formed between Al and substrate materials. In addition to commonly existent ε-Fe 2 Al 5 and ζ-FeAl 3 phases, the formation of Al 4 C 3 and κ-Fe 3 AlC compounds was confirmed {{for the first time in}} the intermetallic layers of ferrous alloys. The Fe 3 Si phase in the intermetallic layers of high Si cast irons was found, which was believed to facilitate the high corrosion rates of high Si cast irons. Moreover, the mechanism by which C in Fe-substrates affects the liquid Al corrosion resistance can be better understood given the present work. Furthermore, the analysis presented here gives an understanding of the nature, growth and dissolution of intermetallic compounds in several cast iron alloys. Higher Si additions to cast irons played an important role in molten metal corrosion by accelerating the material loss and changing the nature of intermetallic layers. The results of this study clearly indicated that the dissolution and the growth of intermetallic compounds are interrelated and the dissolution and/or spallation of the intermetallic layers may be the primary mode of liquid Al corrosion of ferrous alloys...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{bacterial}} community harbored in indoor drinking water taps is regulated by external environmental factors, such as indoor temperature. However, the effect of indoor heating on bacterial regrowth associated with indoor drinking water taps is poorly understood. In the present work, flow cytometry and community-level sole-carbon-source utilization techniques were combined to explore the effects of indoor heating on water bacterial cell concentrations and community carbon metabolic profiles in building <b>tap</b> <b>pipes</b> during the winter season. The {{results showed that the}} temperature of water stagnated overnight (“before”) in the indoor water pipes was 15 – 17 °C, and the water temperature decreased to 4 – 6 °C after flushing for 10 min (“flushed”). The highest bacterial cell number was observed in water stagnated overnight, and was 5 – 11 times higher than that of flushed water. Meanwhile, a significantly higher bacterial community metabolic activity (AWCD 590 nm) was also found in overnight stagnation water samples. The significant “flushed” and “taps” values indicated that the AWCD 590 nm, and bacterial cell number varied among the taps within the flushed group (p < 0. 01). Heatmap fingerprints and principle component analyses (PCA) revealed a significant discrimination bacterial community functional metabolic profiles in the water stagnated overnight and flushed water. Serine, threonine, glucose-phosphate, ketobutyric acid, phenylethylamine, glycerol, putrescine were significantly used by “before” water samples. The results suggested that water stagnated at higher temperature should be treated before drinking because of bacterial regrowth.
