50|$|<b>Thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> - {{sphincter}} of vestibule, {{narrowing the}} laryngeal inlet, shortening the vocal folds, and lowering voice pitch. The internal thyroarytenoid is {{the portion of}} the thyroarytenoid that vibrates to produce sound.|$|R
50|$|For {{more severe}} VCD cases, {{physicians}} may inject botulinum toxin into the vocal (<b>thyroarytenoid)</b> <b>muscles</b> to weaken or decrease muscle tension. Nebulized Lignocaine can {{also been used}} in acute cases and helium-oxygen inhalation given by face mask {{has been used in}} cases of respiratory distress.|$|R
50|$|For {{the lowest}} tones, only the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> are active, {{but as the}} pitch rises, the cricothyroids enter the action, which begins to {{lengthen}} the folds. As longitudinal tension increases, the glottis tends to develop {{a gap in the}} middle. To counteract the tendency, the lateral cricoarytenoids are brought into action, pulling forward on the muscular process of the arytenoids. The process is sometimes referred to as medial compression.|$|R
50|$|The <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> is a broad, thin muscle {{that forms}} {{the body of the}} vocal fold and that {{supports}} the wall of the ventricle and its appendix. It functions to relax the vocal folds.|$|E
5000|$|The fossa is bounded, above, by {{the free}} crescentic {{edge of the}} {{vestibular}} ligament; below, by the straight margin of the vocal fold and laterally, by the mucous membrane covering the corresponding <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{transition}} {{is composed of}} the intermediate and deep layers of the lamina propria.The body is composed of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle.</b> This layered structure of tissues {{is very important for}} vibration of the true vocal folds.|$|E
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{muscles are}} divided into respiratory and the phonatory muscles (the muscles of phonation). The respiratory muscles move the vocal cords apart and serve breathing. The phonatory muscles move the vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The extrinsic, passing between the larynx and parts around; and intrinsic, confined entirely. The main respiratory muscles are the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. The phonatory muscles {{are divided into}} adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, arytenoid muscles) and tensors (cricothyroid <b>muscles,</b> <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles).</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to test the hypothesis that intrinsic laryngeal muscles are involved in producing voice fundamental frequency (F 0) responses to perturbations in voice pitch auditory feedback. Electromyography (EMG) recordings of the cricothyroid and <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> were made with hooked-wire electrodes, while subjects sustained vowel phonations at three different voice F 0 levels (conversational, high pitch in head register, and falsetto register) and received randomized pitch shifts (± 100 or ± 300 cents) in their voice auditory feedback. The median latencies from stimulus onset to the peak in the EMG and voice F 0 responses were 167 and 224 ms, respectively. Among the three different F 0 levels, the falsetto register produced compensatory EMG responses that occurred prior to vocal responses and increased along with rising voice F 0 responses and decreased for falling F 0 responses. For the conversational and high voice levels, the EMG response timing was more variable than in the falsetto voice, and changes in EMG activity with relevance to the vocal responses did not follow the consistent trend observed in the falsetto condition. The data from the falsetto condition suggest that both the cricothyroid and <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> are involved in generating the compensatory vocal responses to pitch-shifted voice feedback...|$|R

40|$|Fifty spontaneously {{breathing}} pentobarbital-anesthetized cats {{were used}} to determine the incidence rate and parameters of short reflex expirations induced by mechanical stimulation of the tracheal mucosa (ERt). The mechanical stimuli evoked coughs; in addition, 67. 6 % of the stimulation trials began with ERt. The expiration reflex mechanically induced from the glottis (ERg) was also analyzed (99. 5 % incidence, p < 0. 001 compared to the incidence of ERt). We found that the amplitudes of abdominal, laryngeal abductor posterior cricoarytenoid, and laryngeal adductor thyroarytenoid electromyograms (EMG) were significantly enhanced in ERg relative to ERt. Peak intrathoracic pressure (esophageal or intra-pleural pressure) was higher during ERg than ERt. The interval between the peak in EMG activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and that of the EMG of abdominal muscles was lower in ERt compared to ERg. The duration of thyroarytenoid EMG activity associated with ERt was shorter than that in ERg. All other temporal features of the pattern of abdominal, posterior cricoarytenoid, and <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> EMGs were equivalent in ERt and ERg...|$|R
50|$|The folds {{are made}} up of elastic and fatty tissue. The folds are covered on the surface by {{laryngeal}} mucous membrane which is supported deeper down underneath by the innermost fibres of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle.</b> In falsetto the extreme membranous edges, i.e. the edges furthest away {{from the middle of the}} gap between the folds, appear to be the only parts vibrating. The mass corresponding to the innermost part of the thyro-arytenoid muscle remains still and motionless.|$|E
50|$|The {{intermediate}} {{layer of the}} lamina propria is primarily made up of elastic fibers while the deep layer of the lamina propria is primarily made up of collagenous fibers. These fibers run roughly parallel to the vocal fold edge and these two layers of the lamina propria comprise the vocal ligament. The transition layer is primarily structural, giving the vocal fold support {{as well as providing}} adhesion between the mucosa, or cover, and the body, the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{three-phase}} {{model is}} the classical view of the respiratory CPG. The phases of the respiratory CPG are characterized by the rhythmic activity of: (1) the phrenic nerve during inspiration; (2) recurrent laryngeal nerve branches that innervate the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> during the last stage of expiration; (3) the internal intercostal nerve branches that innervate the triangularis sterni muscle during {{the second stage of}} expiration. The rhythmicity of these nerves is classically viewed as originating from a single rhythm generator. In this model, phasing is produced by reciprocal synaptic inhibition between groups of sequentially active interneurons.|$|E

40|$|Sleep-disordered {{breathing}} and sleep-related motor phenomena {{are part of}} the clinical spectrum of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Stridor has been attributed to denervation of laryngeal muscles or instead to dystonic vocal cord motion. We studied 3 patients with nocturnal stridor in the setting of MSA. All patients underwent nocturnal videopolysomnography (VPSG) with {{breathing and}} heart rate, O 2 saturation and intra-esophageal pressure recordings, and simultaneous EMG recordings of the posterior cricoarytenoid, cricothyroid, and <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> and continuous vocal cord motion evaluation by means of fiberoptic laryngoscopy. VPSG/EMG and fiberoptic laryngoscopy documented normal vocal cord motion without denervation during wake and stridor only during sleep when hyperactivation of vocal cords adductors appeared in the absence of significant O 2 desaturation. All patients had tachycardia and tachypnea and paradoxical breathing during sleep, erratic intercostalis and diaphragmatic EMG activity and Rem sleep behavior disorder. One of the patients had restless legs syndrome with periodic limb movement during sleep and excessive fragmentary hypnic myoclonus. In conclusion, our patients with MSA had nocturnal stridor due to sleep-related laryngeal dystonia. Stridor was associated with other abnormal sleep-related respiratory and motor disorders, suggesting an impairment of homeostatic brainstem integration in MSA...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} laryngeal muscles display unique {{structural and}} functional characteristics that distinguish {{them from the}} skeletal muscle of the trunk and limbs. These features include relatively small muscle fibers, super-fast contraction speed, and fatigue resistance. The molecular basis of tissue-specific functions and other characteristics is differential gene expression. Accordingly, we have investigated the molecular basis of the functional specialization of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles by examining the expression of two key genes in the larynx, known to be important for skeletal muscle development and function: (a) the muscle regulatory factor, Myf- 5, and (b) the superfast-contracting myosin heavy chain (EO-MyHC). We {{have found that the}} adult <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> express much higher levels of both Myf- 5 and EO-MyHC messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), compared to lower hindlimb skeletal muscle where Myf- 5 mRNA levels are very low and EO-MyHC is not detectable. These findings suggest that the unique functional characteristics of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles may be based in laryngeal muscle-specific gene expression directed by a unique combination of muscle regulatory factors. Such laryngeal muscle-specific genes may allow the future development of new treatments for laryngeal muscle dysfunction...|$|R
50|$|The {{anterior}} {{part of the}} ventricle leads up by {{a narrow}} opening into a pouch-like diverticulum, a mucous membranous sac of variable size called the appendix of the laryngeal ventricle. The appendix (also called the laryngeal saccule, pouch or Hilton's pouch) extends vertically from the laryngeal ventricle. It runs between the vestibular fold, <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle,</b> and thyroid cartilage, and is conical, bending slightly backward. It is covered in roughly seventy mucous glands. The muscles surrounding the appendix compress it until mucus is secreted to lubricate the vocal folds.|$|E
5000|$|Fundamental frequency, {{the main}} {{acoustic}} cue for the percept pitch, can be varied {{through a variety}} of means. Large scale changes are accomplished by increasing the tension in the vocal folds through contraction of the cricothyroid muscle. Smaller changes in tension can be effected by contraction of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> or changes in the relative position of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, as may occur when the larynx is lowered or raised, either volitionally or through movement of the tongue to which the larynx is attached via the hyoid bone. [...] In addition to tension changes, fundamental frequency is also affected by the pressure drop across the larynx, which is mostly affected by the pressure in the lungs, and will also vary with the distance between the vocal folds. Variation in fundamental frequency is used linguistically to produce intonation and tone.|$|E
5000|$|... "Chest {{register}}" [...] is {{the lowest}} register of the singing voice, produced by dominant use of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle.</b> The term [...] "belt" [...] is sometimes mistakenly described {{as the use of}} chest voice in the higher part of the voice. The chest voice is a general term for the sound and muscular functions of the speaking voice, singing in the lower range, and the voice used to shout. Each of those functions requires a thicker closure of the vocal folds and the support of the muscles surrounding them. The term [...] "chest voice" [...] is therefore a misunderstanding when it describes muscular work in the chest-area of the body, or a resonance therein. Proper production of the belt voice, according to some vocal methods, involves minimizing tension in the throat and a change of typical placement of the voice sound in the mouth, bringing it forward into the hard palate, although techniques vary by pedagogical style.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The most {{important}} {{function of the}} larynx is airway protection which is provided through a polysynaptic reflex closure triggered by the receptors in the glottic and supraglottic mucosa, evoking the reflex contraction of the laryngeal muscles especially by strong adduction of vocal cords. Based on the hypotheses that central facilitation is essential for this bilateral adductor reflex and that its disturbance can result in weakened laryngeal closure, we designed this study to elucidate the effect of central facilitation on this protective reflex. Materials and Methods: Seven adult, 20 kg mongrel dogs underwent evoked response laryngeal electromyography under 0. 5 to 1. 0 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) isoflurane anesthesia. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve was stimulated through bipolar platinum-iridium electrodes, and recording electrodes were positioned in the ipsilateral and contralateral <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles.</b> Results: Ipsilateral reflex closure was consistantly recorded regardless of anesthetic levels. However, contralateral reflex responses disappeared as anesthetic levels were deepened. Additionally, late responses (R 2) were detected in one animal at lower level of anesthesia. Conclusions: Deepened level of anesthesia affects central facilitation and results {{in the loss of}} the crossed adductor reflex, predisposing to a weakened glottic closure response. Precise understanding of this effect may possibly provide a way to prevent aspiration in unconscious patients...|$|R
5000|$|The {{transitions}} {{between the}} registers {{are known as}} the passaggi in classical singing. There are several other common names for the passaggio. [...] "Lift" [...] is a word used in some schools of voice training to describe the passaggio. [...] One {{of the most common}} terms for the passaggio is the [...] "break." [...] Marilee David in her book The New Voice Pedagogy explains, [...] "The area where the voice must change registers are often called breaks because the untrained voice appears to break into a new type of production. This break is a sudden gap in sound which occurs when the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles</b> suddenly decrease their activity and the cricothyroid muscles begin to function. A skillful transition of this muscular activity is one of the marks of the trained singer." [...] David does a wonderful job describing the science behind passaggio, however the term [...] "break", while used frequently during commercial styles of singing, such as pop, rock, country, etc., is usually avoided in classical training. As Miller states, [...] "Register terminology should be carefully chosen. 'Breaks' and 'lifts' may well refer to existing register phenomena in a voice, but psychologically they tend to point up the division between registers rather than their unification." ...|$|R

To evaluate the functional outcome of intermittent chronic <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> stimulation in an animal model, 6 canines were implanted with bilateral Medtronic Xtrel systems containing Peterson-type electrodes in the inferior and superior portions of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle.</b> Stimulation was on one side only at 60 Hz, for 5 s on and 5 s off, over 8 h, 5 days per week, up to 8 months. Monthly videorecordings were done under anesthesia to measure the voltage threshold for detectable movement on each side, and vocal fold displacement and velocity during maximal stimulation of each side. Movement thresholds were lower in the inferior portion of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> (P </= 0. 0005). Movement velocity was greater on the stimulated than on the nonstimulated side after 3 to 8 months (P = 0. 039).

40|$|Objectives: We {{established}} an animal model of recurrent laryngeal nerve reinnervation with persistent vocal fold immo-bility following recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Methods: In 36 rats, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve was transected and the stumps were abutted in a silicone tube with a 1 -mm interspace, facilitating regeneration. The mobility of the vocal folds was examined endoscopically 5, 10, and 15 weeks later. Electromyography of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> was performed. Reinnervation {{was assessed by}} means of a quantitative immunohistologic evaluation with anti-neurofilament antibody in the nerve both proximal and distal to the silicone tube. The atrophy of the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> was assessed histologically. Results: We observed that all animals had a fixed left vocal fold throughout the study. The average neurofilament expres-sion in the nerve both distal and proximal to the silicone tube, the muscle area, and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential recorded from the <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscle</b> on the treated side increased significantly (p < 0. 05) over time, demonstrating regeneration through the silicone tube. Conclusions: Recurrent laryngeal nerve regeneration through a silicone tube produced reinnervation without vocal fold mobility in rats.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} microinjection of codeine into the caudal ventral respiratory column (cVRC) on the cough reflex. Experiments were performed on 36 anesthetized spontaneously breathing cats. Electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded bilaterally from inspiratory parasternal and expiratory transversus abdominis (ABD) muscles and unilaterally from laryngeal posterior cricoarytenoid and <b>thyroarytenoid</b> <b>muscles.</b> Repetitive coughing was elicited by mechanical stimulation of the intrathoracic airways. The unilateral microinjection of codeine (3. 3 mM, 20 – 32 nl) in the cVRC reduced cough number by 29 % (P < 0. 01) and expiratory cough amplitudes of esophageal pressure by 33 % (P < 0. 05) as well as both ipsilateral and contralateral ABD EMGs by 35 % and 48 % (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 01, respectively). No cough depression was observed after microinjections of vehicle. There was no significant effect of microinjection of codeine in the cVRC (3. 3 mM, 30 – 40 nl) on ABD activity induced by a microinjection of d,l-homocysteic acid (30 mM, 27 – 40 nl) in the same location. However, a cumulative dose of codeine (0. 1 mg/kg, 330 nmol/kg) applied into the brain stem circulation through the vertebral artery reduced the ABD motor response to cVRC d,l-homocysteic acid microinjection (30 mM, 28 – 32 nl) by 47 % (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Optimal {{management}} of vocal fold paralysis would entail recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) reinner-vation resulting in normal vocal fold motion. Unfortunately, RLN reinnervation currently {{results in a}} nonfunctional vocal fold due to synkinetic reinnervation. Therapeutic interventions that guide regenerating axons back to the appropriate muscle would prevent synkinesis and restore vocal fold and glottal function. The initial step toward developing these therapies is the elucidation of the embryologic innervation of the larynx. This study aimed to identify the age of occurrence, timing, and pattern of embryologic innervation of the rat larynx, hypothesizing that differences in these parameters exist between distinct laryngeal muscles. Study Design: Descriptive anatomic study. Methods: The larynx of rats aged embryologic day (E) 15, 16, 17, 19, and 21 were harvested and then sectioned. Two rats were used for each age. Sections were colabeled with neuronal class III b-tubulin polyclonal antibody to identify the presence of axons and alexa 488 conjugate a-bungarotoxin to identify the presence of motor endplates.
