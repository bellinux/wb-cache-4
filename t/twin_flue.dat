500|$|When {{the lake}} first opened {{there were four}} Woolf {{compound}} rotative beam pumping engines, housed in two separate buildings. They were built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock between 1900 and 1905. The engine's beam is [...] long and weighs17tons. The flywheel is [...] in diameter and weighs 20tons, having a crank throw of [...] Each beam engine had an output of [...] at 17rpm. The high-pressure cylinders, [...] in diameter and with a [...] stroke, were supplied by steam from horizontal Lancashire-type <b>twin</b> <b>flue</b> boilers with Green's economisers at [...] The low-pressure cylinder was [...] in diameter and has a [...] stroke. Three engines with a fourth on standby could pump water {{at a rate of}} [...] per day, whilst the boilers consumed 8.5tons of coal per day. A mechanical efficiency of 90% was claimed, the [...] diameter pump bucket, [...] strike and plunger diameter of [...] gave a pump output of [...] per stroke. They ran until 1949, when two engines from the north engine house were replaced by electric pumps. In 1950 automatic shutdown equipment was installed to prevent damage {{in the event of a}} burst main or overloading of the new electric pumps. This meant that it was no longer essential to have staff on site 24 hours a day. The decorative chimney was shortened in the 1960s. In 2014 new split-case vertical pumps and various other new equipment was installed to replace those installed in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E

They were built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock between 1900 and 1905. The engine's beam is 34 ft long and weighs 17 tons. The flywheel is 20 ft in diameter and weighs 20 tons, having a crank throw of 3.5 ft. Each beam engine had an output of [...] at 17 rpm. The high-pressure cylinders, 21 in in diameter and with a 3.25 ft stroke, were supplied by steam from horizontal Lancashire-type <b>twin</b> <b>flue</b> boilers with Green's economisers at [...] The low-pressure cylinder was 34 in in diameter and has a 7 ft stroke. Three engines with a fourth on standby could pump water {{at a rate of}} [...] per day, whilst the boilers consumed 8.5 tons of coal per day. A mechanical efficiency of 90% was claimed, the 30 in diameter pump bucket, 3.5 ft strike and plunger diameter of 21 in gave a pump output of 107 imp gal per stroke. They ran until 1949, when two engines from the north engine house were replaced by electric pumps.

In 2014 new split-case vertical pumps and various other new equipment was installed to replace those installed in the 1940s and 1950s.In 1984 it was decided to preserve the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre, including a Museum in the old boiler house, which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30,000 visitors a year. The flywheel is now driven by an electric motor. The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building, while the gothic-style meter house is Grade II listed and used as a bat sanctuary.|$|E
2500|$|Rocket uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous {{locomotive}} boilers {{consisted of}} a single pipe surrounded by water (though the Lancashire Witch did have <b>twin</b> <b>flues).</b> Rocket has 25 copper fire-tubes that carry the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney. [...] This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with boiler water when compared to a single large flue. Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{circular}} shot hole {{cut into the}} stairs {{between the first and}} second floors. The roof houses a chemin de ronde around the gables, a high rectangular chimney crowned with <b>twin</b> lozenge-shaped <b>flues</b> and corbels which once supported a corner bartizan.|$|R
