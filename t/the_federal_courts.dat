5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional. The amendment, which ultimately failed, was offered {{in the aftermath of}} a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States declaring an occupying claimant law to be unconstitutional; Rowan personally disagreed with the Court's decision. Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> would be subject to state laws when carrying out the decisions of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide {{the constitutionality of the}} claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|In September 1976, Boston {{law firm}} Ropes & Gray opined that the state's $27 million {{municipal}} bond issue {{could not go}} forward using property within the claim area as collateral. On September 29, Governor Longley flew to Washington, and Maine's delegtion introduced legislation directing <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> not to hear the tribe's claim; Congress adjourned before the bills could be considered.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Parliament passed {{legislation}} which divided <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> into two <b>courts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Trial Division became <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada, while <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Appeal Division became <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal. <b>The</b> {{jurisdiction of the}} two new courts {{is essentially the same}} as the corresponding former divisions of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|R
50|$|Article 95 {{establishes}} <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Justice, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Administrative <b>Court,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Finance <b>Court,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Labour <b>Court</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Social <b>Court</b> as supreme {{courts in}} their respective areas of jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada was established, inheriting {{much of the}} {{jurisdiction}} of <b>the</b> Exchequer <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada gained {{the jurisdiction}} to hear judicial reviews from federal agencies and tribunals. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada had two divisions, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> [...] - [...] Trial Division and <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> [...] - [...] Appeal Division.|$|R
5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|The bottom {{two floors}} of the {{facility}} house offices, including those for <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts,</b> the U.S. Attorney's Office, the U.S. Marshals Service, and U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services. Additionally, there are offices for both of Oregon's United States Senators and an office for a single member of the United States House of Representatives. Representative Peter DeFazio of Oregon's 4th congressional district uses that office.|$|E
5|$|United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} upheld the {{constitutionality}} of the Major Crimes Act of 1885. This Congressional act gave <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> jurisdiction in certain cases of Indian-on-Indian crimes, even if the crimes were committed on an Indian reservation. Kagama, a Yurok Native American (Indian) accused of murder, was selected as a test case by the Department of Justice to test {{the constitutionality of}} the Act.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} was dismissed by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court.</b> On appeal, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal upheld {{the decision of}} <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court,</b> Trial Division. <b>The</b> decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|R

5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a {{transitory}} period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
5|$|Scalia took a broad {{view of the}} Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain {{lawsuits}} against states in <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> In his 1989 dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., Scalia stated {{that there was no}} intent {{on the part of the}} framers to have the states surrender any sovereign immunity and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, Chisholm v. Georgia, came as a surprise to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Parliament passed <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> Act which {{abolished}} the Exchequer Court {{and created a}} new <b>court,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada. That Court had two divisions: <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Trial Division, and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> – Appeal Division. Although the two divisions had different functions, they were {{all part of a}} single court.|$|R
5000|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, court {{agreed with}} much of the {{judgement}} of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court,</b> but found that it was inappropriate for <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> to engage in claims construction absent a [...] "foundation of knowledge about the relevant art". <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal remanded the construction of the patent claims back to the Commissioner for expedited re-examination.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and the Judicature Act 1908 (NZ) {{authorise}} the High Court {{to sit in}} Australia and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Australia to sit in New Zealand. Orders of the High Court {{sitting in}} Australia are enforced by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Australia and orders of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> sitting in New Zealand are enforced by the High Court.|$|R
5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> protect voting rights in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).|$|E
5|$|Taft {{appointed}} 13 {{judges to}} <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> of appeal and 38 to the United States district courts. Taft also appointed judges to various specialized courts, {{including the first}} five appointees each to the United States Commerce Court and the United States Court of Customs Appeals. The Commerce Court, created in 1910, stemmed from a Taft proposal for a specialized court to hear appeals from the Interstate Commerce Commission. There was considerable opposition to its establishment, which only grew when one of its judges, Robert W. Archbald, was in 1912 impeached for corruption and removed by the Senate the following January. Taft vetoed a bill to abolish the court, but the respite was short-lived as Wilson signed similar legislation in October 1913.|$|E
5|$|Taft's ruling had {{no bearing}} on the cases of Governor Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall except to spell out a means {{for them to take}} their cases to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts,</b> if necessary. On the same day that Taft's ruling was issued, Taylor filed suit in Jefferson County circuit court against Beckham and Adjutant General John Breckinridge Castleman to prevent them from exercising any {{authority}} due the offices they claimed. Unaware of Taylor's suit, Beckham filed suit against Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court – a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause. Marshall also filed suit against Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter to prevent them from exercising any authority in the state senate, where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer.|$|E
50|$|Blanchard {{continued}} in the finance ministry after Camille Thériault became Premier of New Brunswick and was re-elected to his Campbellton riding in 1999. He served briefly in opposition before being appointed to <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada in 2000, shortly thereafter he also took {{a seat on the}} Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada. When <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Canada was split into <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal in 2003, he took a seat on <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> while maintaining his post on the Court Martial Appeal Court.|$|R

50|$|He wrote 578 {{judgments}} for <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> and 324 judgments for <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal.|$|R
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not have {{jurisdiction}} because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that it wanted to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E
5|$|U. S. v. Rhodes (1866), one of {{the first}} Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of {{provisions}} in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be abolished. With In Re Turner (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Richmond {{convention}} opened, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document clause by clause, which may have played {{into the hands of}} the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and who had more able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason's motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times in the discussion, on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted the president would use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future Chief Justice of the United States, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> should not have {{jurisdiction}} by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
