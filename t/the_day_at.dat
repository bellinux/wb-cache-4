They were later supported by Sam Loxton (93)who hit five sixesand Ray Lindwall (77), who both struck the ball powerfully.

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of several dromaeosaurids (Microraptor, Sinornithosaurus, and Velociraptor) and modern birds and {{reptiles}} indicate that some dromaeosaurids (including Microraptor and Velociraptor) {{may have been}} nocturnal predators, while Sinornithosaurus is inferred to be cathemeral (active throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> short intervals). However, the discovery of iridescent plumage in Microraptor has {{cast doubt on the}} inference of nocturnality in this genus, as no modern birds that have iridescent plumage are known to be nocturnal.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the storm}} quickly downgraded, and by August 19 {{it was once}} again at minimal {{hurricane}} force. At roughly the same time, it turned more to the west, although it maintained a general northwesterly path. The abrupt weakening {{may have been the}} result of a seeding experiment carried out on the storm in an attempt to deteriorate it. By later in the day, Debbie had begun to restrengthen. It resumed Category 3 intensity on August 20, despite a minor oscillation in magnitude during <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>At</b> this point, the cyclone acquired peak winds of 120mph (195km/h); shortly thereafter, its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951 millibars.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{excellent}} {{performance of the}} infantry, both comitatenses and limitanei, is a recurrent feature of Ammianus' history. At the Persian siege of Amida, Ammianus' eye-witness account describes the city's defence by limitanei units as skilful and tenacious, if ultimately unsuccessful. At Strasbourg (357), the infantry showed remarkable skill, discipline and resilience throughout, saving <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> two critical moments.(see Battle of Strasbourg for a detailed account). Even at the disaster of Adrianople, the Roman infantry fought on, despite being abandoned by their cavalry and surrounded on three sides by overwhelmingly superior numbers of Goths.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up {{with the}} Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the ring around the {{remnants}} of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and Črnomelj without facing resistance, reaching Vinice by the end of <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>At</b> Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included Andrej Gosar. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of Slovenia into Italian and German-controlled territories, and the council and its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective.|$|E

5|$|As a hadrosaurid, Prosaurolophus {{would have}} been a large herbivore, eating plants with a {{sophisticated}} skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material {{would have been}} cropped by its broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like structure. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around 4meters (13ft) above. Like other hadrosaurs, it could have moved both bipedally and quadrupedally. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Prosaurolophus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> short intervals.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>At</b> night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E

5|$|By 13 September the regiment's {{strength}} was four officers and eighty other ranks. All of them except fourteen machine-gunners were evacuated {{to the island}} of Lemnos. Of the original contingent who had landed in May only twenty-four men were still with the regiment. On 10 November reinforcements increased the regiment's total to nine officers and 363 other ranks, and they returned to Gallipoli, reaching the front line at Hill 60 on 27 November. Lack of manpower meant they could not fully man their trenches, so a system was adopted where six men manned a post, with only two on duty during <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>At</b> night all men were awake and also patrolled between posts and into no man's land.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the total}} income from these {{projects}} the company continued {{to lose money}} and Jobs, {{as chairman of the}} board and now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison. Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story would probably be a hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance. For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO. Toy Story went on to gross more than $362million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape's as the biggest IPO of the year. In only its first half-hour of trading Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of un-matched buy orders. Shares climbed to $49 before closing <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> $39.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>at</b> about 2:30pm, South Vietnamese Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, {{discovered}} that the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had moved into positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos. To stop them from advancing any further, Phu ordered his soldiers to destroy every bridge connected to Highway 14. By the time Phu’s order was carried out, elements of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had engaged in clashes with the South Vietnamese for more than 10 hours. By 5pm the North Vietnamese 8th Battalion, 149th Regiment, {{in combination with the}} 198th Special Forces Regiment, tried but failed to capture Hoa Binh airfield, which was defended by one South Vietnamese ranger battalion.|$|E
