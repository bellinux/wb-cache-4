50|$|The cheek bulges, and {{the wide}} and deep {{depression}} below them, suggest a muscular arrangement associated with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, whereby {{it is possible for}} such an animal to pull <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth forwards as is characteristic of mammals, while in true reptiles <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth are fixed and very close to <b>the</b> articulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw. This is a significant arrangement, because even with a secondary palate an animal {{would not be able to}} suck unless <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth can be brought forward, allowing the mouth as a whole to close properly around <b>the</b> teat <b>of</b> a milk gland.|$|R
5|$|On 7 April 2010, Robben sent Bayern {{into the}} semi-finals of the Champions League with a {{stunning}} volley against Manchester United {{from the edge}} of the area into <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> net. The game ended 3–2 to United (4–4 on aggregate), with Bayern advancing again due to away goals.|$|E
5|$|The Memorial {{was built}} to a design by Lord Foster of Thames Bank and Danish {{designer}} Per Arnoldi, on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Mall and Horse Guards Road, directly outside the Old Admiralty Building.

5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left {{to go to the}} nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{pyramidal}} roof on {{towers of}} square plan.

Each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower is topped with an even triangular gable from <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> which runs a ridge to <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof.

5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a cursor {{to direct the}} main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her stamina, in which case she may recover her stamina by sitting on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for later use. The layout of items changes with each play-through.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{destruction}} after 1789, {{very little}} {{remains of the}} Bastille in the 21st century. During the excavations for the Métro underground train system in 1899, {{the foundations of the}} Liberté Tower were uncovered and moved to <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boulevard Henri IV and the Quai de Celestins, where they can still be seen today. The Pont de la Concorde contains stones reused from the Bastille.|$|E

5|$|LGV Picardie is a {{proposed}} high-speed line between Paris and Calais via Amiens. By cutting off <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LGV Nord at Lille, it would enable Eurostar trains to save 20minutes {{on the journey}} between Paris and Calais, bringing the London–Paris journey time under 2hours. In 2008 the French Government announced its future investment plans for new LGVs to be built up to 2020; LGV Picardie was not included but was listed as planned in the longer term. It has later been confirmed that LGV Picardie {{is intended to be}} built between 2020 and 2030.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City started sprightly, {{managing}} {{to create some}} chances which forced saves from Stoke goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen and steady defending to keep Stoke City in {{the game in the}} first half. Yaya Touré unleashed a 30-yard strike in the 11th minute which went only inches wide of the top corner of the goal, while Mario Balotelli had a curling shot from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty area in the 24th minute which was destined for the goal but for a strong, one-handed save from Sørensen.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} races of {{professional}} road cycling. It was first run in 1896 and has stopped only for the two world wars. The race was created by two Roubaix textile manufacturers, Théodore Vienne (born 28 July 1864) and Maurice Perez. They had been behind the building of a velodrome on 46,000 square metres at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rue Verte and the route d'Hempempont, which opened on 9 June 1895.|$|E

Another stone, known as the Hajar as-Sa’adah (Stone of Felicity) is set into the Kaaba's opposite corner, al-Rukn al-Yamani (the Yemeni Corner), at a somewhat lower height than the Black Stone. The choice of the east corner may have had ritual significance; it faces the rain-bringing east wind (al-qabul) and the direction from which Canopus rises.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson {{has said that he}} does not remember how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E

From 1936 to 1945, Göttingen had the Zieten barracks and the Zieten Terrace; Pietrowice (German: Peterwitz) in the rural community of Głubczyce (German: Leobschütz) in Silesia was called Zietenbusch from 1936 to 1945.|$|E
5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} accommodated in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, {{such as the}} Old Firm derbies, {{the whole of the}} Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E
5|$|Dynamite Headdy is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King's army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin and the key masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw his head in any direction to attack enemies. His head {{can also be used}} to grab hooks and pull himself up to other platforms. Headdy's health is represented by a spotlight in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, they will lose a life.|$|E
