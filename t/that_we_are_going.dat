5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I can tell you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship {{and we have the}} crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend Harry Peach, a fellow member of the Design and Industries Association (DIA), Pick {{explained}} his choice of Holden: [...] "I may say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to build our stations upon the Morden extension railway to the most modern pattern. We are going to discard entirely all ornament. We are going to build in reinforced concrete. The station will be simply a hole in the wall, everything being sacrificed to the doorway and some notice above to tell you to what the doorway leads. We are going to represent the DIA gone mad, and in order that I may go mad in good company I have got Holden to see that we do it properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series' primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a {{compelling}} adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: [...] "It created the curious implication that we are standing still in space, when our franchise is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again! It was just an oddity, and I don't think the Kazon have served us well." [...] While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her [...] "intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens".|$|E

500|$|On 20 December 2012, Gorham {{revealed}} that the new material would be recorded {{under the name of}} Black Star Riders, and that Downey and Wharton had chosen not to participate in the new band project. Downey had decided to take a break from touring, and Wharton would be working on his own band Dare, and a film project. In March 2013, the band toured Australia under the Thin Lizzy name, with Downey and Wharton, as the opening act on a triple bill with Mötley Crüe and Kiss. Gorham stressed that Thin Lizzy would still perform together occasionally: [...] "We'll still go out as Thin Lizzy. There are still certain big festivals that we will do. Thin Lizzy is still on the horizon, we will still go out and do that but in the meantime we have Black Star Riders <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to concentrate on also." ...|$|E
500|$|Gillard, as a Member of Parliament, {{voted against}} {{a bill that}} would have legalised {{same-sex}} marriage in Australia in 2011. In 2010 she stated [...] "the Marriage Act is appropriate in its current form, that is recognising that marriage is between a man and a woman" [...] and that marriage being between a man and woman [...] "has a special status". The triennial Labor conference held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. When the private members bill was introduced by Labor backbencher Stephen Jones, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012. In September 2014, Gillard said that the [...] "course of human history now is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see same-sex marriage here and in, you know, most parts of the developed world." [...] She declared her support for same-sex marriage in August 2015.|$|E
500|$|On August 4, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{visited the}} {{construction}} site and {{was impressed by the}} project and its purpose. He gave a speech to workers and spectators, closing with this statement: [...] "I leave here today with the feeling that this work is well undertaken; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> ahead with a useful project, {{and we are going to}} see it through for the benefit of our country." [...] Soon after his visit, Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK. In , for an additional , MWAK and Six Companies, Inc. agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam. Six Companies had just finished the Hoover Dam and was nearing completion of Parker Dam. The new design, chosen and approved by the Reclamation office in Denver, included several improvements, one of which was the irrigation pumping plant.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Wilkinson was an {{opponent}} of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she {{was elected to the}} Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... just as we have [...] {{opened the door to the}} older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to build".|$|E

[...] According to the Georgian commander, the United States would transport the troops to Georgia and initially 1,000 troops would leave; U.S. officials only {{said that they were}} studying options for transportation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1911, Carnegie {{became a}} {{sympathetic}} benefactor to George Ellery Hale, {{who was trying}} to build the [...] Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, and donated an additional ten million dollars to the Carnegie Institution with the following suggestion to expedite the construction of the telescope: [...] "I hope the work at Mount Wilson will be vigorously pushed, because I am so anxious to hear the expected results from it. I should like to be satisfied before I depart, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to repay to the old land some part of the debt we owe them by revealing more clearly than ever to them the new heavens." [...] The telescope saw first light on November 2, 1917, with Carnegie still alive.|$|E
2500|$|He {{also argued}} that a {{proposed}} £26,000-a-year benefits cap, would {{not lead to a}} rise in homelessness or child poverty [...] "The reality is that with £26,000 a year, it’s very difficult to believe that families will be plunged into poverty – children or adults," [...] he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. [...] "Capping at average earnings of £35,000 before tax and £26,000 after, actually means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to work with families make sure that they will find a way out." [...] but added there would need to be [...] "discretionary measures". Duncan Smith led the governments legislation in the House of Commons in January 2013 to cap most benefit increases at 1%, a real terms cut.|$|E
2500|$|... {{and flew}} to London {{to meet with}} the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, on 11 December. On arrival he told the media that Skybolt was an {{expensive}} and complex program that had suffered five test failures. [...] Kennedy told a television interviewer that [...] "we don't think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get $2.5 billion worth of national security". US National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy gave an interview on television in which he stated that the US had no obligation to supply Skybolt to the UK. Thorneycroft had expected McNamara to offer of Polaris instead, but found him unwilling to countenance such an offer except as part of a Multinational Force. McNamara was willing to supply Hound Dog, or to allow the British to continue development of Skybolt.|$|E

2500|$|... "Before {{we go on}} the {{offensive}} politically or militarily we take the greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland {{without being able to}} justify our right to such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the fourth}} day, Robert Croft and Darren Thomas held Warwickshire briefly at bay with a {{partnership}} of 75, but this wasn't enough as Glamorgan succumbed for 323. Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, [...] "Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch {{they were always}} going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive. We {{had a bit of}} luck so {{we are not going to}} start going around saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to win the Championship just because we have won one match." [...] John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, [...] "Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make sure that we did not get back into the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} in the press that the Sauber, Lotus and Force India teams had considered withdrawing from the race to signal a message to Formula One's commercial leaders about the current financial state of the sport following Caterham and Marussia's non-participation in the race. Ecclestone stated that if two of those teams left Formula One then [...] "that is what will happen" [...] and that teams should only be taking part if they were competitive. Force India team principal Bob Fernley said discussions about a boycott but it would only be performed as a final recourse. Lotus owner Gérard Lopez later admitted he had not heard about the proposed boycott and the team insisted that they would contest the Grand Prix. Vijay Mallya, the owner of Force India, severely criticised suggestions of a boycott six days after the race: [...] "Who said that we wanted to boycott the race? Please tell me. If I am wrong, you educate me. I speak on behalf of Force India. I have never said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to boycott, and I have clarified this in Austin. Why would we? We have come to go racing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haussmann's {{renovation}} of Paris had many critics during his own time. [...] Some were simply {{tired of the}} continuous construction. [...] The French historian Léon Halévy wrote in 1867, [...] "the work of Monsieur Haussmann is incomparable. [...] Everyone agrees. Paris is a marvel, and M. Haussmann has done in fifteen years what a century could not have done. But that's enough for the moment. There will be a 20th century. Let's leave something for them to do." [...] Others regretted that he had destroyed a historic part of the city. The brothers Goncourt condemned the avenues that cut at right angles {{through the center of}} the old city, [...] where [...] "one could no longer feel in the world of Balzac." [...] Jules Ferry, the most vocal critic of Haussmann in the French parliament, wrote: [...] "We weep with our eyes full of tears for the old Paris, the Paris of Voltaire, of Desmoulins, the Paris of 1830 and 1848, [...] when we see the grand and intolerable new buildings, the costly confusion, the triumphant vulgarity, the awful materialism, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to pass on to our descendants." ...|$|E
