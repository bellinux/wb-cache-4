2500|$|The first title {{published}} by Heinemann was Caine's 1890 three-volume novel The Bondman, {{a plot of}} revenge and romance set in the late 18th century Isle of Man and Iceland. It commences {{with the story of}} a seaman who marries the daughter of Iceland’s Governor-General, abandoning her before the birth of their child. Between June and November 1889 it was serialised in the Isle of Man Times, General Advertiser and several provincial newspapers. Accompanied by Mary, Caine made a research visit to Iceland in August 1889, during which he made a seventy-mile round day trip from Reykavik to Krysuvik. William Heinemann was so pleased with initial sales, eventually selling almost half a million copies, that he named his company's <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> after the novel's main character, [...] "Sunlocks".|$|E

50|$|A <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> or {{cable address}} {{was a unique}} {{identifier}} code for a recipient of telegraph messages. Operators of telegraph services regulated the use of telegraphic addresses to prevent duplication. Rather like a uniform resource locator (URL), the telegraph address did not contain any routing information (aside from possibly a city name), but instead could be looked up by telegraph office personnel, who would then manually direct {{the message to the}} office nearest the destination or to an intermediate office. Since the destination address of a telegram counted as part of the message, using a short registered address code saved the expense of sending a complete street address. Telegraph addresses were chosen either as versions of a company's name or as a memorable short word, somehow associated with the recipient. Occasionally, an organization would be best known by its <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address,</b> for example Interflora or Interpol. A <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> was a valuable part of a company's corporate identity, and disputes sometimes arose when a competitor registered a <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> similar to a trade name or identifier used by a rival.|$|E

60|$|But {{on the way}} {{a thought}} struck Shirley, and he {{determined}} {{to take time to}} go to the post-office. There might be something for him, and he had not thought of it before. There he found a <b>telegraphic</b> message <b>addressed</b> to him and sent from Vera Cruz to New York, and thence forwarded by mail. It was from Captain Horn, and was as long as an ordinary business note, and informed Shirley that the Captain expected to be in Jamaica not long after this message reached Kingston. There was no regular steamer which would reach there in good time, but he had chartered a steamer, the Monterey, which was then being made ready for sea as rapidly as possible, and would probably clear for Kingston in a few days. It urged Shirley not to fail to keep the Dunkery Beacon in port until he arrived.|$|R

50|$|In May 1914, Hewlett & Blondeau {{purchased}} {{a field in}} Leagrave, Bedfordshire, specifically to build Farman aircraft. In order to retain links with its former base in Clapham, the firm kept the old <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> 'Aeromnia', and named the factory The Omnia Works. When the First World War started in August 1914, the factory was able to meet government orders for aircraft for the wartime expansion of the Royal Flying Corps.|$|E
50|$|Its Mexco (short for Mining Explosives Company) <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> led to {{it being}} known as The Mexico by local people. After a fatal {{accident}} in 1939 the proprietors decided {{to abandon the}} manufacture of high explosives and instead make an explosive-substitute based on a large reusable steel cartridge filled with carbon dioxide. The premises still needed to be licensed under the 1875 Explosives Act, as gunpowder {{was used in the}} detonator.|$|E
50|$|However, it also produced, from 1906 until 1926, {{parts for}} and then {{complete}} petrol-driven commercial vehicles. Initially, it manufactured chassis for heavy motor vehicles, including London buses, later also producing engines, with the vehicles branded as Hallfords (after its <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address,</b> a conflation of 'Hall' and 'Dartford'). Brewers and haulage contractors equipped their fleets with Hallfords, and the British Army deployed Hallford lorries during World War I. They {{continued to be}} sold until 1926.|$|E
50|$|Oxford University Press came to India in 1912, {{and learned}} of the {{existence}} of the Oxford Bookstores shortly after they were set up in 1920.

50|$|Patent {{disputes}} between Siemens and AEG resulted in both companies, {{at the behest}} of William II, German Emperor, founding a common enterprise, the Society for Wireless Telegraphy Ltd. The company's <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address,</b> Telefunken, eventually became the company name. Arco greatly increased the power and range of early transmitters. In this regard he surpassed the Löschfunkensender of Max Wien, which had already exhibited a substantially better efficiency than the Knallfunkensender of Ferdinand Braun, and in addition could send on a narrow frequency band.|$|E

50|$|Oxfam is an {{international}} confederation of charitable organizations focused on the alleviation of global poverty. Oxfam was founded at 17 Broad Street in Oxford, Oxfordshire, in 1942 as the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief {{by a group of}} Quakers, social activists, and Oxford academics; this is now Oxfam Great Britain, still based in Oxford. It was one of several local committees formed in support of the National Famine Relief Committee. Their mission was to persuade the British government to allow food relief through the Allied blockade for the starving citizens of occupied Greece.

A major extension to this site in 1989 took the floor area to 45,000 sq.ft and further extensions and mezzanine work give a current day total of 52,000 sq.ft of production and office space.In March 2012 Norbar exchanged contracts with Hella Ltd to purchase its 170,000 sq ft Wildmere Road site in a move which will see Norbar relocate completely by early 2014 and Hella move to new premises in the Banbury area.|$|E
50|$|The Wroclaw Electronic Works (Wrocławskie Zakłady Elektroniczne) were {{established}} 6 February 1959; the name Elwro {{was derived from}} the company's <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address.</b> The first model designed at this plant was the vacuum-tube based Odra 1001, released in December 1960; this was a research computer not put into serial production. The next model was the Odra 1002 which was constructed from transistors made in Poland, in 1962. The Elwro factory was responsible for mass production of the tube-based UMC-1 designed at Warsaw University of Technology; twenty five units were built from 1962 through 1965. Concurrently design work was proceeding on the Odra 1003 transistor computer, which was faster than the UMC-1, and used much less power. The first 1003 was built in 1963 and work was continued on improvements, resulting in the 1013 which was faster, and had a 256 word core memory as well as a drum with 8000 words.|$|E
5000|$|In 1976 British-born Canadian author William Stevenson {{published}} {{a biography of}} Stephenson, A Man Called Intrepid. Some of the book's statements have been called into question; in a review the same year, Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote that [...] "This book... is, from start to finish, utterly worthless," [...] while other former intelligence personnel and historians criticized the book for inaccuracies. Nigel West's 1998 book Counterfeit Spies asserts that [...] "Intrepid" [...] was probably not Stephenson's codename, but BSC's <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> in New York. Stevenson was a frequent visitor to Bermuda, where Stephenson had taken up residence during after the war. He was an ex-naval officer, having served in the Fleet Air Arm during the war with prominent Bermudian lawyer William Kempe (a founding partner of Appleby, Spurling & Kempe), a prominent Bermudian law firm (another author and frequent visitor to Bermuda was ex-naval officer Ian Fleming).|$|E

They knew of the Florists Telegraph Delivery Association (now known as Florists' Transworld Delivery) which had existed in the US since 1910, and applied to join as foreign members. In 1923 the UK arm of the FTDA was formed with 17 members. One of the straplines used in advertising was Flowers by Wire when the telegraph was actually used to communicate between florists. Later, telegrams were sent from member to member requesting deliveries {{to be made in}} the recipient florists area. In the original Interflora Directory, used by members, the longest established members could be recognised by their telegraphic addresses. This would be the only <b>telegraphic</b> <b>address</b> in that city to include the name Interflora.
