Victor and Jorge were taken to separate hospitals for their injuries. A city hazmat team and the state Department of Environmental Protection arrived by the afternoon to decontaminate the area. At about 3:45pm, a DEP contractor sorting through tubs of chemicals in the bed of the truck found a black garbage bag. Inside were human remains.|$|E

25|$|Despite this redecoration, the East Room was {{nonetheless}} somewhat shabby by 1861. On April 18, 1861, about 60 militiamen from Kansas took up temporary {{residence in the}} East Room pending construction of barracks {{for them in the}} city. They did serious damage to <b>the</b> <b>carpet,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes shot bullets into the walls. Mary Todd Lincoln refurbished the room with damask drapes, lace curtains, wallpaper, and a new $2,500 carpet later that year. The wallpaper was heavy patterned velvet cloth paper from Paris in crimson, garnet, and gold, and supplied by William H. Carryl & Brother of New York. The floor covering was an Axminster carpet woven in Glasgow, Scotland. The largest loom in the world was needed to weave the carpet, which covered the entire floor. The drapes were crimson with heavy gold fringe and numerous gold tassels, while the lace curtains behind them were imported from Switzerland.|$|E
500|$|Billingsley's {{original}} {{plan for the}} Cub Room was {{for it to be}} a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends. The room was added to the club during World War II. Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space, but it was Walter Winchell who began to call it the Cub Room. The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a [...] "lopsided oval". The room was lit with pink tones. [...] On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' powder room. After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>and</b> chairs, and a pinkish-red for the banquettes. The Cub Room's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th-century race horses. As a concession to those who wanted to have a business lunch at The Stork, the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time. The sanctum sanctorum, the Cub Room ("the snub room"), was guarded by a captain called [...] "Saint Peter" [...] (for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven).|$|E
2500|$|Both the Phoenix and Dragon, and the Marby rug, have {{additional}} rows of knots on their backsides. At {{a distance of}} every 6cm, rows of loosely tied knots of red thread are woven in. Another carpet fragment from Fustat has similar additional knots. It {{has been suggested that}} these rows of knots mark the weaver's progress during a given time. On average, the additional knots are repeated every 15 rows in the Dragon and Phoenix rug. At an estimated original width of 1 m, about 3800 knots were woven between two rows of the additional red knots, consistent with the dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>and</b> the amount of knots a single weaver can tie in a carpet during a day.(Beselin 2011, p.46–49) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Senate is characterised by the {{predominance}} of the colour red, in both <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>and</b> the red leather of the seating and desks. [...] This reflects its role as the upper house and as a deliberative house like the House of Lords at Westminster. [...] The seating is in a horse-shoe pattern, around a central table. [...] Each senator had a seat and a desk, including those {{sitting on the front}} benches (i.e., ministers). [...] At {{the end of the table}} is a desk for the clerks and behind them a large chair for the president. [...] Behind it are two thrones, to be used by the monarch and consort or, in their stead, the Governor-General and spouse, at official occasions such as the State Opening of Parliament. [...] The furnishings conform to Murdoch's simplified classical style.|$|E

2500|$|The animal carpet {{fragment}} {{is approximately}} half the original size. Its field contains two large, 16-pointed star medallions of identical design which both include an eight-pointed star within an octagon. In every second {{segment of the}} medallions two birds appear, alternating with two four-legged animals. The field between the medallions is ornamented with smaller rosettes and eight-pointed stars. Each corner contains a mosque lamp ornament. In {{the center of the}} long side an octagonal smaller medallion is inserted. The Batári-Crivelli fragment resembles the [...] "Dragon and Phoenix" [...] and [...] "Marby" [...] rugs in having a yellow ground and two large medallions as the main element of design. Chromatographic analysis of the dyes revealed yellow from an undefined plant, indigo blue, madder (Rubia tinctorum) red, a blue green derived from indigo, Dyer's weed (Reseda luteola), and Dyer's sage (Salvia fruticosa), dark brown and undyed, ivory wool. [...] During the 13th International Congress of Turkish Art, held in Budapest on 3 September 2007, the fragment was renamed in honour of Ferenc Batári, the late curator of <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>and</b> textile department of the museum.|$|E

2500|$|Very {{little is}} known with {{certainty}} about Stevin's life and {{what we know is}} mostly inferred from other recorded facts. [...] The exact birth date and the date and place of his death are uncertain. [...] It is assumed he was born in Bruges since he enrolled at Leiden University under the name Simon Stevinus Brugensis (meaning [...] "Simon Stevin from Bruges"). [...] His name is usually written as Stevin, but some documents regarding his father use the spelling Stevijn (pronunciation [...] ). [...] This is a normal spelling shift in 16th century Dutch. [...] He was born around the year 1548 to unmarried parents, Anthonis (Anton) Stevin and Catelyne van der Poort. [...] His father {{is believed to have been}} a cadet son of a mayor of Veurne and a member of the schuttersgilde (city militia) Sint-Barbara of Bruges. [...] While Simon's father was not mentioned in the book of burghers, the fact that he was a member of the militia allows a safe assumption that he was. Many other Stevins were later mentioned in the Poorterboeken (burgher registry books). Simon Stevin's mother Cathelijne (or Catelyne) was the daughter of a wealthy family from Ypres. [...] Her father Hubert was [...] a poorter of Bruges. [...] Simon's mother Cathelijne later married Joost Sayon who was involved in <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>and</b> silk trade and a member of the schuttersgilde Sint-Sebastiaan. Through her marriage Cathelijne became a member of a family of Calvinists and Simon was likely brought up in the Calvinist faith.|$|E
