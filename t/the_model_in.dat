5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft in the context of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

5|$|Etty {{generally}} finished life studies {{during three}} evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints {{to fill in}} the figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on millboard, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.|$|E
30|$|Several {{mathematical}} {{models of}} infections are proposed and investigated.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the precise value of M/F ratios that generate different types of tooth movements and compare the M/F ratios between <b>the</b> <b>models</b> with bracket and without bracket, as well as different directions (buccal-lingual and distal-mesial directions). A patient-specific canine has chosen as <b>the</b> <b>model</b> to study. For the same type of tooth movement, the value of M/F ratio is larger for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> without bracket than for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> with bracket. <b>In</b> additional, the displacement amplitude is lower for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> with bracket. This can be explained that <b>the</b> bracket <b>model</b> has larger area to sustain orthodontic force. By looking at the force system applied in different directions, one can notice that the displacements of the crown and the apex for <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> distal-mesial direction are far less than for <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> buccal-lingual direction. More M/F ratios are needed for <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> buccal-lingual direction (Figs.  4 and 5). There are principal results of two causes, in which there is a smaller contact area of the canine at the lingual side compared to the mesial side (Fig. 3) and the force system did not pass though the CRe when the force system applied to <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> buccal-lingual direction.|$|R
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
5|$|The 767-200 was the {{original}} model and entered service with United Airlines in 1982. The type has been used primarily by mainline U.S. carriers for domestic routes between major hub centers such as Los Angeles to Washington. The 767-200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic ETOPS flights, beginning with TWA on February 1, 1985 under 90-minute diversion rules. Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft. There were 44 passenger and freighter conversions of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> commercial service as of July 2016. The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.|$|E
