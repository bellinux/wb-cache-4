5|$|The {{work of the}} {{surveying}} {{team was}} greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task. To find {{the volume of the}} mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical prisms and compute the volume of each. The triangulation task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain. Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of interpolating a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only could he easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented contour lines, in common use since for depicting cartographic relief.|$|E
25|$|At 1655 on the 24th, in a {{moderate}} gale, Fortress C of 206 Squadron RAF from Benbecula, dropped six depth charges on <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> of a diving U-boat. Fortress D found U-710 on the surface {{less than an hour}} later and sank it with depth charges as the U-boat attempted to fight back rather than submerge. U-710 was just 10 miles ahead of the convoy, though probably unaware of its proximity.|$|E
25|$|Periodic {{vibration}} of a {{cyclone separator}} would indicate vortex instability. Large centrifugal fans sometimes use radial inlet blades {{that can be}} rotated to control the flow into the fan; they create a swirling flow. At near shutoff, where <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> is very high, rotating blade stall of the fan blades occurs. Although not researched, it is highly likely that swirl instability is the cause. The feedback is clearly hydrodynamic (Class I) {{and there is no}} indication that more than one stage occurs.|$|E
30|$|The {{semicircle}} groove on {{the tube}} surface can produce <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> flow through <b>the</b> test section. <b>The</b> <b>swirling</b> flow can separate into two types: main and secondary <b>swirling</b> flows. <b>The</b> main <b>swirling</b> flow is found in all DRs, while <b>the</b> secondary <b>swirling</b> flow is detected at DR[*]â‰¥[*] 0.06. <b>The</b> <b>swirling</b> flow disturbs <b>the</b> thermal boundary layer near the tube wall that is reason for heat transfer augmentation. The intensity or strength of <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> flow depended on DR and PR of the groove. The increasing DR and reducing PR lead to augmenting strength of the flow that helps to increase heat transfer rate in the test section.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} apply a {{swirling}} jet to a PDC drill bit, the nozzle performance influenced by nozzle inlet geometric parameters and rock breaking tests under submerged conditions were studied. Numerical simulation was used to study {{the influence of the}} nozzle structure on <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> intensity and nozzle discharge coefficient. Simulation results indicate that spreading angle of <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> jet is greater than that of the non-swirling jet, and <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> intensity of <b>the</b> jet is strongly influenced by the length of the nozzle body but weakly by the number of tangential inlets. Rock breaking tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> jet. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> jet shows a lower threshold pressure to break the rock samples and could break rock more efficiently compared with the non-swirling jet.|$|R
25|$|During {{this time}} Krishnamurti had {{developed}} a strong bond with Annie Besant and came to view her as a surrogate mother. His father, who had initially assented to Besant's legal guardianship of Krishnamurti, was pushed into the background by <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> of attention around his son. In 1912 he sued Besant to annul the guardianship agreement. After a protracted legal battle Besant took custody of Krishnamurti and Nitya. As {{a result of this}} separation from family and home Krishnamurti and his brother (whose relationship had always been very close) became more dependent on each other, and in the following years often travelled together.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{creating}} swirl in the vortex whistle {{was considered the}} cause for lack of dynamic similarity, so <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> was created in a pipe with a contraction having swirl blades followed by an expansion to create the required axial backflow. This was the vortex whistle in a pipe. Measurements made with this geometry, are shown in the figure on the right. As can be seen, dynamic similarity was achieved with both air and water. This whistle became a flow meter called the swirlmeter. Its accuracy rivals that of the vortex shedding meters described above but has a higher pressure drop. The feedback is hydrodynamic (Class I) and only one stage was found.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} air system targeted high reduction. In 1954 CE moved their secondary air from about 1 m below the liquor guns to about 2 m above them. The air ratios and temperatures remained the same, but to increase mixing 50m/s secondary air velocities were used. CE changed their frontwall/backwall secondary to tangential firing at that time. In tangential air system the air nozzles {{are in the}} furnace corners. The preferred method {{is to create a}} swirl of almost the total furnace width. In large units <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> caused left and right imbalances. This kind of air system with increased dry solids managed to increase lower furnace temperatures and achieve reasonable reduction. B had already adopted the three-level air feeding by then.|$|E
40|$|The thermal and {{emission}} {{characteristics of}} a swirl-stabilized turbulent inverse diffusion flame (IDF) burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were studied experimentally {{and the results of}} visible flame lengths, flame temperatures, in-flame gaseous species concentrations and global pollutant emissions were reported. The flame shape and length of <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> IDF and a non-swirling IDF were compared. <b>The</b> <b>swirling</b> IDF is featured by a large internal recirculation zone (IRZ), which {{plays an important role in}} stabilizing and shortening the flame. Compared with the non-swirling IDF, <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> IDF is shorter, wider and more stable. For <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> IDF, both temperature and species distributions are uniform in the IRZ. Comparison of the radial NOx/temperature distributions indicates that the thermal NO mechanism plays a leading role in NOx formation, since the high-temperature IRZ favors thermal NO production. The effects of air jet Reynolds number (Re) and overall equivalence ratio (F{cyrillic}) on centerline temperature and emission index were examined. The main finding is that the IRZ which is large in size and high in temperature dominates the thermal and emission characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> flame. Efforts were made to compare the global NOx and CO emissions of <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> and non-swirling IDFs. It was found that strong swirl and lean combustion are two key factors for reducing NOx emission. However, the decreasing NOx emission is compromised by increasing CO. Under stoichiometric and rich conditions, EINOx of <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> IDFs is slightly higher, but the EICO is significantly lower. Further comparison of EINOx with other studies indicates that <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> IDF can achieve low NOx emission. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|In 1919 Ricardo was {{studying}} the phenomena affecting the combustion within the petrol engine and the diesel engine. He realised that turbulence within the combustion chamber increased flame speed, {{and that he}} could achieve this by offsetting the cylinder head. He also realised that making the chamber as compact as possible would reduce the distance that the flame had to travel and would reduce the likelihood of detonation. He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> being initiated by inclined ports and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber for diesel engines. This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of pressure rise and good fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field. Studies of this whistle have shown that dynamic similarity based on the pipe diameter d as the characteristic length scale, and inlet mean flow speed U as the characteristic speed was not achieved, {{as shown in the}} lower figure on the right. A more correct speed would be that characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E
500|$|Shea's role {{in resolving}} {{differences}} within NASA, and between NASA and its contractors, {{placed him in}} a position where criticism was inevitable. However, even Shea's critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills. Everyone who knew Shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer,Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 121. and his time as manager at ASPO only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the Titan project. Of Shea's work in the mid-1960s, Murray and Cox write that [...] "these were Joe Shea's glory days, and whatever <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> of opinions about this gifted, enigmatic man, he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward." [...] Shea's work also won wider attention, bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to Wernher von Braun or Chris Kraft. Kraft had appeared on the cover of Time in 1965; Time planned to offer Shea the same honor in February 1967, the month in which the first manned Apollo mission was scheduled to occur.|$|E

The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada â€“ fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela.

500|$|Unlike its predecessor, EarthBound {{does not}} use random encounters. When {{physical}} contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess {{a certain amount of}} HP. Blows to an enemy reduce the amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reach zero, that enemy is defeated. If a specific type of enemy is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually [...] "rolls" [...] down, similar to an odometer. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious. If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, with half the money on his person {{at the time of his}} defeat, and with other party members showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl which fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> is red). Neutral priority is indicated by a blue swirl. Additionally, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather than chase them.|$|E

40|$|Large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) of single-phase {{turbulent flow}} in a fuel assembly for a {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) was performed.
