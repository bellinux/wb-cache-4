5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19thcentury and the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the focus of Russian feminism shifted from the aristocracy to the peasants and working class. Imbued with socialist ideology, young women began to organize all-women unions among female factory workers, who tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> or marginalized by male socialists.|$|E
5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b> The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|E
5|$|Various {{protocols}} {{have been}} drawn up detailing {{a course of action}} for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post-detection protocols must address three issues: what to do in the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; and analyzing the long-term consequences of the message received. No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law, and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> if contact occurs.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} well {{organized}} for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about capturing it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b> Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendant}} tells Scully that Mr. Milsap is {{the only}} person with a working phone, but she discovers that the line is dead. Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure. She advises them {{to take him to the}} hospital, but they pretend that they do not have any cars. While examining the man, Scully discovers a strange circular wound on his back. Meanwhile, Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived yet, and so he sets out to find her.|$|E
5|$|Whitney gets {{a job as}} a {{teaching}} assistant at Walford Primary School. During one breaktime, she warns Dennis Rickman Jnr (Harry Hickles) not to run in the playground. He ignores her and falls over, grazing his arm. Whitney does not react in the professional manner she is supposed to, causing Dennis's injury <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b> When Dennis's mother, Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) questions Dennis about his injury, he lies that Whitney assaulted him. Sharon complains and Whitney is suspended, but appeals for her job and is allowed to keep it. Whitney later sets her sights on newcomer Johnny Carter (Sam Strike), unaware that he is gay. Johnny's parents, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), hope that Johnny and Whitney will become an item, but his sister Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) reveals to them that he is gay. A few weeks later, Johnny comes out to Whitney, which hurts her as she feels that Johnny has been using her. They later become good friends and Whitney forgives Johnny.|$|E

5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b> It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E

40|$|The chiral phase {{transition}} {{at a certain}} critical temperature is a restoration mechanism of the chiral symmetry, broken by the nonzero mass of quarks and mesons.

25|$|Johnson's {{skill as}} a fighter and the money that it brought made it {{impossible}} for him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> by the establishment. In the short term, the boxing world reacted against Johnson's legacy. But Johnson foreshadowed {{one of the most famous}} boxers of all time, Muhammad Ali. In fact, Ali often spoke of how he was influenced by Jack Johnson. Ali identified with Johnson because he felt America ostracized him in the same manner because of his opposition to the Vietnam War and affiliation with the Nation of Islam.|$|E

The amendment enabled covenants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed on such land stating that it might be claimed back by the Tribunal, even if in private hands.

25|$|The {{presence}} of copepods in the New York City {{water supply system}} has caused problems for some Jewish people who observe kashrut. Copepods, being crustaceans, are not kosher, nor are they small enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> as nonfood microscopic organisms, since some specimens can be seen with the naked eye. When a group of rabbis in Brooklyn, New York, discovered the copepods {{in the summer of}} 2004, they triggered such enormous debate in rabbinic circles that some observant Jews felt compelled to buy and install filters for their water. The water was ultimately ruled kosher by posek Yisrael Belsky.|$|E
25|$|Yang Jisheng, {{a long-time}} {{communist}} party member and {{a reporter for}} the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, puts the blame squarely on Maoist policies and the political system of totalitarianism, such as diverting agricultural workers to steel production instead of growing crops, and exporting grain at the same time. During the course of his research, Yang uncovered that some 22 million tons of grain was held in public granaries {{at the height of the}} famine, reports of the starvation went up the bureaucracy only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> by top officials, and the authorities ordered that statistics be destroyed in regions where population decline became evident.|$|E

Nevertheless, most individual officeholders tend to view LGBT issues as a private matter (<b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored)</b> or a moral problem (to be opposed). The PRI has allied with the PAN to block legislation concerning LGBT rights in some states (except in two cases).

The foxtail on some of the figures was a symbol at the time of ridicule in political caricature and real life.
