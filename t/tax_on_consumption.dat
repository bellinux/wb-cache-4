Johnson has said he favors simplifying and reducing taxes. During his governorship, Johnson cut taxes fourteen times and never increased them. Due to his stance on taxes, political pundit David Weigel described him as [...] "the original Tea Party candidate." [...] Johnson has advocated the FairTax as a template for tax reform. This proposal would abolish all federal income, corporate and capital gains taxes, and replace them with a 23% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption</b> of all non-essential goods, while providing a regressive rebate to households according to household size, regardless of income level.

30|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} types of taxation used by U.S. states are <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption</b> and personal income. In 2007, 49 percent of state tax revenues came from consumption taxes, and 32 percent from income taxes. The conventional wisdom is that consumption is more stable than income through the business cycle, implying that <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption</b> {{are likely to be}} less volatile than <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income. However, <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> are also widely assumed to be more regressive than income taxes, though incidence varies depending on the specific bases and rate structures and the time period of analysis (Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy 2009; Chernick and Reschovsky 1997). If these assumptions are correct, states face a potential tradeoff between vertical equity and revenue stability.|$|R

5000|$|The {{thrust of}} {{thinking}} among some economists is that <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption</b> are always {{more efficient than}} <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income, arguing that the latter have a greater disincentive effect. One problem with this analysis is defining what constitutes consumption and what constitutes investment. [...] Another {{problem is that the}} impact will vary from country to country, depending on the design of the tax system and the relative levels of different tax rates. A more nuanced empirical analysis is required to evaluate this issue. For lower-income working people, who spend most of their income, <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption</b> also have a significant disincentive effect; while higher-income people may be motivated more by prestige and professional achievement than by after-tax income. Any gain in economic efficiency from shifting taxes to consumption may be quite small, while the adverse effects on income distribution may be large.|$|R

50|$|In 1954, {{he invented}} an {{indirect}} <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption</b> {{which became the}} TVA.

50|$|A {{value-added}} tax, {{like the}} GST, also has several features {{that make it}} attractive. A <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption,</b> not income, the tax system inherently encourages savings and investments instead of consumption. The tax also has a self-policing mechanism that discourages evasion, unlike a retail sales tax system or an income tax system, which would be relatively easier to evade.|$|E

5000|$|A broad-based {{goods and}} {{services}} tax (GST) had previously been proposed by both the Labor Party and the Coalition {{as a means of}} reducing the reliance of the Commonwealth on income tax, by increasing the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumption.</b> The existing wholesale sales tax only applied to certain products, while the mooted GST would apply to all products and services equally.
