25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product {{on the same day}} but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

As they were standing there watching MTV, Knopfler remembers the man coming up with lines such as [...] "what are those, Hawaiian noises?...that ain't workin'," [...] etc. Knopfler asked for a pen to write some of these lines down and then eventually put those words to music.|$|E

Joseph Wilcox, who was {{carrying}} a concealed weapon, drew his weapon and confronted Jerad, but passed Amanda as he did so, not realizing that she was armed and Jerad's accomplice; Amanda shot and killed Wilcox. Police later responded to 9-1-1 calls and arrived at the Walmart, engaging the Millers in a gunfight, during which Amanda was wounded. The Millers moved toward <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> where they tried to protect themselves from gunfire using several items from the store as a barricade. Police eventually shot and killed Jerad, while Amanda shot and critically wounded herself in the head. She was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where she died.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2011 Joplin tornado in which the walls of a Home Depot {{collapsed}} in Joplin after being hit by an EF5 tornado, The Kansas City Star, citing engineers, criticized Home Depot's practice of using tilt-up construction in hundreds of its big-box stores (other nearby big-box stores in Joplin, including a Walmart and Academy Sports, which had concrete block construction, lost their roofs but the walls remained intact). In tilt-up construction the concrete is poured onsite, lifted into place, and then attached to the roof. The engineers told the Star that the practice, while normally safe and efficient, is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted (as happened in Joplin) the walls collapse in a domino effect. [...] Seven people were killed {{in the front of the}} store when the 100,000-pound walls collapsed on them, while 28 people in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> survived when those walls collapsed outward. Only two of the slab walls in the Home Depot survived. In contrast, 3 people died in the Walmart but 200 survived. Engineers noted that when concrete block construction fails, structural elements break in pieces and usually not in huge slabs. [...] Home Depot said it fundamentally disagreed with the engineers quoted by the Star and said it would use tilt-up construction when it rebuilds the Joplin store.|$|E

There were forests of dwarf pines and oaks, centuries old yet two or three feet in height, and imported at enormous care and expense. A tiny bridge, a pace across, arched over a miniature river that flowed with rapids and cataracts from a miniature lake stocked with myriad-finned, orange-miracled goldfish that in proportion to the lake and landscape were whales. On every side the many windows of the several-storied shack-buildings looked down. In the centre of the garden, on the narrow gravelled walk close beside the lake Ah Kim was noisily receiving his beating.|$|E
6000|$|On Wednesday all was changed. From {{the town}} of Nolan, eight miles away, came a story which put a quite {{different}} light on the matter. Nolan consisted of a school house, a blacksmith's shop, a [...] "store" [...] and a half-dozen dwellings. The store was kept by one Henry Odell, a cousin of the elder May. On {{the afternoon of the}} Sunday of May's disappearance Mr. Odell and four of his neighbors, men of credibility, were sitting in the store smoking and talking. It was a warm day; and both the front and the back door were open. At about three o'clock Charles May, who was well known to three of them, entered at the front door and passed out at the rear. He was without hat or coat. He did not look at them, nor return their greeting, a circumstance which did not surprise, for he was evidently seriously hurt. Above the left eyebrow was a wound--a deep gash from which the blood flowed, covering the whole left side of the face and neck and saturating his light-gray shirt. Oddly enough, the thought uppermost in the minds of all was that he had been fighting and was going to the brook directly at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> to wash himself.|$|E

60|$|I {{began my}} {{business}} career {{on the following}} Monday morning. At breakfast, held earlier than usual on my account, my mother's sympathy was the more eloquent for being unspoken, while my father wore an air of unwonted cheerfulness; charging me, when I departed, to give his kindest remembrances to my Cousin Robert Breck. With a sense of martyrdom somehow deepened by this attitude of my parents I boarded a horse-car and went down town. Early though it was, the narrow streets of the wholesale district reverberated with the rattle of trucks and echoed with the shouts of drivers. The day promised to be scorching. At {{the door of the}} warehouse of Breck and Company I was greeted by the ineffable smell of groceries in which the suggestion of parched coffee prevailed. This is the sharpest remembrance of all, and even to-day that odour affects me somewhat in the manner that the interior of a ship affects a person prone to seasickness. My Cousin Robert, in his well-worn alpaca coat, was already seated at his desk behind the clouded glass partition next the alley at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> and as I entered he gazed at me over his steel-rimmed spectacles with that same disturbing look of clairvoyance I have already mentioned as one of his characteristics. The grey eyes were quizzical, and yet seemed to express a little commiseration.|$|E
6000|$|My {{business}} relations {{were with the}} house that so promptly honored my letter of credit. This house had published in the East the campaign life of Lincoln which I had lately written, and I dare say would have published the volume of poems I had written earlier with my friend Piatt, {{if there had been}} any public for it; at least, I saw large numbers of the book on the counters. But all my literary affiliations were with Ticknor & Fields, and it was the Old Corner Book-Store on Washington Street that drew my heart as soon as I had replenished my pocket in Cornhill. After verifying the editor of the Atlantic Monthly I wised to verify its publishers, and it very fitly happened that when I was shown into Mr. Fields's little room at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> with its window looking upon School Street, and its scholarly keeping in books and prints, he had just got the magazine sheets of a poem of mine from the Cambridge printers. He was then lately from abroad, and he had the zest for American things which a foreign sojourn is apt to renew in us, though I did not know this then, and could not account for it in the kindness he expressed for my poem. He introduced me to Mr. Ticknor, who I fancied had not read my poem; but he seemed to know what it was from the junior partner, and he asked me whether I had been paid for it. I confessed that I had not, and then he got out a chamois-leather bag, and took from it five half-eagles in gold and laid them on the green cloth top of the desk, in much the shape and of much the size of the Great Bear. I have never since felt myself paid so lavishly for any literary work, though I have had more for a single piece than the twenty-five dollars that dazzled me in this constellation. The publisher seemed aware of the poetic character of the transaction; he let the pieces lie a moment, before he gathered them up and put them into my hand, and said, [...] "I always think it is pleasant to have it in gold." ...|$|E
