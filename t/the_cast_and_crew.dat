5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> {{that he would have}} to defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. <b>The</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
