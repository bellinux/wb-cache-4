The fifth started that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> <b>with</b> Slaughter and Moore flying out. With two outs however, the Cardinals started hitting. Musial doubled, Kurowski walked, Slaughter tripled, and Dusak singled. All but Dusak scored on the hits, {{bringing}} the score to 5–1 and ending Hatten's day. Hank Behrman came on in relief.

New Zealand recorded victories over the touring Ireland and Wales teams, Ireland losing their match by a record 66–28 after number eight Jamie Heaslip received a red card for kneeing McCaw in the head. The All Blacks went through the TriNations undefeated with {{the final game of}} the tournament against Australia marking McCaw's 52nd time captaining the All Blacks, surpassing Sean Fitzpatrick as New Zealand's most-capped test captain.|$|E

Among the oldest recognized and most extensively accredited courses in Portugal, are those university degrees awarded by the state-run universities.

In addition to the year end awards, there are three lifetime awards - Race Register of Merit, Superior Race Horse and Supreme Race Horse. A Register of Merit is awarded when a horse attains a speed index of 80 or above. A Superior Race Horse is achieved when the horse earns 200 racing points. A Supreme Race Horse award requires the horse to satisfy the following three criteria - 1) win over $500,000.00 in earnings, 2) win two Grade 1 stakes races and 3) win a total of ten races.|$|E

25|$|In July 2009, Lisch {{signed with}} the Perth Wildcats of the Australian National Basketball League. Wildcats head coach Rob Beveridge helped sway Lisch to come to Perth due to his close {{friendship}} with Billikens head coach Rick Majerus. Lisch struggled to begin his rookie season. While Beveridge was quietly chuffed with his signing of Lisch, many Wildcats supports {{and much of the}} Perth community didn't feel <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> <b>with</b> some fans calling for Lisch to be cut as early as the preseason tournament. Beveridge took Lisch under his wing from day one and became a father figure with absolute faith in him. Lisch debuted with a 12-point effort on September 25, 2009 against the Wollongong Hawks. A month later, in his sixth game on October 25, Lisch scored a season-high 21 points against the Melbourne Tigers. He scored in double figures in seven of his first eight games before registering 11 single-figure games {{throughout the rest of the}} season, including five straight games of under 7 points between December 19 and January 8.|$|E
25|$|The strangeness flavour {{quantum number}} S (not to be {{confused}} with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called symmetric, as they would all behave in exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> respect to the strong interaction. Since quarks {{do not have the same}} mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.|$|E
