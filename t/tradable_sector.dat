40|$|It is a {{well-known}} empirical fact that the goods producing (<b>tradables)</b> <b>sector</b> of industrialized economies tends {{to have a higher}} rate of labor productivity growth than the service (non-tradables) sector. The difference has been used to explain unbalanced sectoral growth patterns, structural inflation and other macroeconomic phenomena. This paper sets forth and tests the proposition that {{a significant part of the}} observed productivity growth difference is the result of a relative decline of the <b>tradables</b> <b>sector,</b> which in turn is caused by macroeconomic disturbances leading to a relative increase of the product wage in that sector. Explicit hypotheses on an endogenous determination of productivity growth differences are derived from a small macro model and tested on data from 1960 to 1975 for 14 OECD countries divided into two groups: large economies and small open economies. We find empirical support for the hypothesis of a structural explanation of the sectoral productivity growth difference in both large and small economies. For small open economies there is also a significant relationship between product wage disturbances and the relative decline of the <b>tradables</b> <b>sector.</b> The empirical analysis indicates that in these countries productivity growth is the same in both sectors in the absence of product wage disturbances...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{integration}} with the European Union, the Baltic States enjoyed strong {{economic growth and}} subsequently among the fastest economic growth in Europe. Thus, the Baltic States emerged as the top destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI). Generally majority FDI into the Baltic States was directed towards the non-tradable goods sector, notably real estate and financial sector compared to manufacturing sector. In this case, some researcher has argued that such investment {{would lead to the}} consumption boom, but would not translate into productivity gains in the <b>tradable</b> <b>sector.</b> Subsequently, this caused the labour and capital resources reallocation from more competitive sectors routing to non-tradable sectors thus inflating internal demands.|$|E

50|$|Reserve {{accumulation}} can be {{an instrument}} {{to interfere with the}} exchange rate. Since the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1948 to the foundation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, the regulation of trade is a major concern for most countries throughout the world. Hence, commercial distortions such as subsidies and taxes are strongly discouraged. However, there is no global framework to regulate financial flows. As an example of regional framework, members of the European Union are prohibited from introducing capital controls, except in an extraordinary situation. The dynamics of China’s trade balance and reserve accumulation during {{the first decade of the}} 2000 was one of the main reasons for the interest in this topic.Some economists are trying to explain this behavior. Usually, the explanation is based on a sophisticated variation of mercantilism, such as to protect the take-off in the <b>tradable</b> <b>sector</b> of an economy, by avoiding the real exchange rate appreciation that would naturally arise from this process. One attempt uses a standard model of open economy intertemporal consumption to show that it is possible to replicate a tariff on imports or a subsidy on exports by closing the current account and accumulating reserves. Another is more related to the economic growth literature. The argument is that the <b>tradable</b> <b>sector</b> of an economy is more capital intense than the non-tradable sector. The private sector invests too little in capital, since it fails to understand the social gains of a higher capital ratio given by externalities (like improvements in human capital, higher competition, technological spillovers and increasing returns to scale). The government could improve the equilibrium by imposing subsidies and tariffs, but the hypothesis is that the government is unable to distinguish between good investment opportunities and rent seeking schemes. Thus, reserves accumulation would correspond to a loan to foreigners to purchase a quantity of tradable goods from the economy. In this case, the real exchange rate would depreciate and the growth rate would increase. In some cases, this could improve welfare, since the higher growth rate would compensate the loss of the tradable goods that could be consumed or invested. In this context, foreigners have the role to choose only the useful tradable goods sectors.|$|E

In a small open economy, export goods are produced with capital, high-skilled and low-skilled labor, and traded for imported consumption goods. Non-tradable services are produced with low-skilled labor only. A rise in the productivity of capital has two effects: (1) It may reduce the demand for labor in the <b>tradable</b> <b>sector</b> if the substitutability of low-skilled labor and capital in the <b>tradable</b> <b>sector</b> is high; and (2) it increases the demand for non-tradables and its labor input. Overall demand for low-skilled labor declines if the labor force of the <b>tradable</b> <b>sector</b> is large relative to the labor force of the non-tradable sector.
