5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While {{this is a major}} advancement relative to other religions in India, it is still not a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both <b>the</b> <b>deity</b> of knowledge and <b>the</b> <b>deity</b> of wealth are female.|$|E

50|$|According to Hindu beliefs, {{once the}} divine has been invoked in a murti, {{it becomes an}} {{embodiment}} of the Divine. Accordingly, Swaminarayan sadhus (monks) offer devotional worship to <b>the</b> <b>deities</b> throughout <b>the</b> day. Before dawn, they awaken <b>the</b> <b>deities</b> by singing morning hymns (prabhatiya). <b>The</b> <b>deities</b> are then bathed and offered food and garments depending {{on the time of}} the day and season. Food that has been offered to <b>the</b> <b>deities</b> is considered sanctified. These holy offerings are distributed to the devotees as prasadam. Arti, a ritual where devotees sing the glory of God while a lighted wick is circulated before the murtis, is performed five times a day and named mangala aarti, shanagar aarti, rajabhoga aarti, sandhya aarti and shayana aarti, respectively. Food is offered to <b>the</b> <b>deities</b> throughout <b>the</b> day. Finally, sadhus adorn the murtis with night garments and ask <b>the</b> <b>deities</b> to retire for the night.|$|R

5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{iconographic}} forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. There is ample evidence from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in stone to suggest that a cult centred around <b>the</b> <b>deity</b> may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular iconographic form, temples dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>deity</b> are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while five others are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> popular <b>deities</b> {{have evolved}} {{significantly}} over time. For example, Mariamman, another deity of subalterns, is highly {{influenced by the}} Vedic rituals.

Sometimes these restructuring processes led to the degradation of <b>the</b> <b>deities.</b> When they stress the holiness of <b>the</b> <b>deities</b> of Vedic tradition {{at the same time they}} denied the holiness of <b>the</b> <b>deities</b> of <b>the</b> folk tradition.

5|$|The Shaktisamgama-tantra narrates {{the birth}} of Ucchishta-matangini. Once, the god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi visited Shiva and his second wife Parvati (a reincarnation of Sati) and gave them a banquet of fine foods. While eating, the deities dropped some food on the ground, from which arose a {{beautiful}} maiden who asked their left-overs. The four deities granted her their left-overs as prasad, food made sacred by having been first consumed by <b>the</b> <b>deity.</b> This {{can be interpreted as}} the Ucchishta of <b>the</b> <b>deity,</b> although due to its negative connotation the word Ucchishta is never explicitly used in connection to prasad. Shiva decreed that those who repeat her mantra and worship her will have their material desires satisfied and gain control over foes, declaring her the giver of boons. From that day, the maiden was known as Ucchishta-matangini.|$|E

5|$|According to anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere, {{the cult}} of Kali reached Sri Lanka via South India. Although Kali shrines may {{have been part of}} Tamil Hindu temples prior to 12th century CE, the Sinhalese Buddhist {{population}} came to revere Kali as a village demon at least by the 12th century CE. The first known Hindu temple with a shrine to Kali to become popular with the Sinhalese Buddhists is Munneswaram. A myth that has Kali landing at the town of Chilaw, and residing in Munneswaram, has made the temple a popular place of visit for cursing and sorcery purposes. In the early 1970s, the majority of the Sinhalese visitors were there for sorcery purposes, but by the 1990s more than half have been visiting the temple for general veneration purposes, demonstrating the transformation of <b>the</b> <b>deity</b> from a malevolent demigod to a mother goddess. The veneration of Kali has completely overtaken the previously popular veneration of Pattini. Since the 1960s a number of Sinhalese Buddhist shrines dedicated to Kali have sprung up all over the island, especially in urban areas. These are managed by Sinhalese priests who are trance specialists and act as intermediaries between <b>the</b> <b>deity</b> and the devotee while being possessed by <b>the</b> <b>deity.</b> The popular veneration of previously Hindu deities such as Kali and Kataragama deviyo (the latter identified with the Hindu Skanda) have fundamentally altered the rational nature of Theravada Buddhism towards the Bhakti (“Personal veneration of deity”) aspect of Hinduism. Following protests by Buddhist monks and animal rights activist, the government banned the age old custom of animal sacrifices at the Kali temple in 2011.|$|E
