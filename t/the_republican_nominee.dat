Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nominee</b> in the general election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor would also be African American. Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies {{gained control}} of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his {{administration}} and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform. Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard, limit government and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term. The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nominee,</b> triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900.

5|$|Cooper {{served on}} the board of {{trustees}} for the University of Kentucky from 1935 to 1946. In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As a result of a mandatory primary election law passed in 1935, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nominee</b> would not be chosen by a nominating convention, as was typical for the party. Cooper garnered only 36% of the vote in the primary, losing the nomination to King Swope, a Lexington circuit court judge and former congressman.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Nunn again {{considered}} {{a bid for}} governor, precluding a potential bid by his son, Steve, a state representative from Glasgow.

Nunn reconciled with his son, and when Steve ran for governor in 2003, Louie supported him.

The same day, the September 11 attacks took place, which {{dampened}} the ensuing general election campaign between Lynch and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nominee,</b> state Senator Jo Ann Sprague. As both sides turned to similar themes of patriotism and defense, Lynch {{benefited from the}} demographics of his district. On October 16, he defeated Sprague 65%-33%.|$|E

5|$|State Senator Chris Lauzen, Geneva mayor Kevin Burns, {{and dairy}} {{businessman}} Jim Oberweis all entered {{the campaign for}} the Republican nomination to succeed Hastert.

5|$|After {{rendering}} noncombat {{service in}} World War II and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, {{becoming the first}} Republican county judge {{in the history of}} Barren County, Kentucky. He worked on the campaigns of Republican candidates for national office, including John Sherman Cooper, Thruston Morton, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nominee</b> for governor in 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to Democrat Ned Breathitt. An executive order signed by Governor Bert T. Combs that desegregated Kentucky's public services became a major issue in the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.|$|E
