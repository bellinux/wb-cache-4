25|$|Though the {{election}} {{had been held}} in May, Parliament did not resume sitting until October, {{one of the longest}} break periods in Confederation. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> in the budget soured Clark's relationship with Ontario Premier Bill Davis, even though both were Red Tories. Even before the budget, the government was criticized for its perceived inexperience, such as in its handling of its campaign commitment to move Canada's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.|$|E

Portman worked with Democratic Senator Jon Tester in 2012 to end the practice of government shutdowns and partnered with Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill on an inquiry into the Obama administration's public relations spending. [...] Portman has proposed [...] "a balanced approach to the deficit" [...] by reforming entitlement programs, writing [...] "eforms should not merely squeeze health beneficiaries or providers but should rather reshape key aspects of these programs to make them more efficient, flexible and consumer-oriented." [...] Portman became known for his ability to work in a bipartisan fashion when working to pass a repeal of the excise tax on telephone service. [...] He also unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to the surface transportation reauthorization bill to allow states to keep <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> money they collect, instead of sending it to Washington with some returned later.|$|E
2500|$|The first ferry {{service was}} started on July 1, 1923, linking Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas. The first {{gasoline}} tax was enacted in 1923 {{at the rate}} of $0.02/gal (equivalent to $/gal today), but vetoed by Governor Alex Groesbeck. It was later enacted effective in 1926. The highway commissioner was also given complete control over the planning and maintenance of the state trunklines. Construction switched to concrete or asphalt only instead of gravel and macadam with an increase in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> in 1927. Highway construction in the 1920s earned Michigan national attention. The first trunklline completed in concrete was M-16 (later part of US 16). The road was built to a standard of [...] and between [...] thick. The current standard at the time was [...] wide and [...] thick. The 1920s were also busy for Michigan highways as Michigan developed the yellow-line center line to indicate no-passing zones for sight-restricted hills and curves. Roadside picnic tables, soil testing and aerial surveying of highways also debuted at this time. As MDOT historians put it, [...] "the age of mud was over; the age of concrete was moving in.|$|E

Proponents argued that this could potentially reduce {{the price of gas}} at the pump by about 18.4 cents a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline and 24.4 cents a gallon for diesel. If it were done, it was estimated <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> holiday would save consumers roughly $30 over the three-month period it would be instated.

50|$|Prior to the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 and the {{establishment}} of the Highway Trust Fund, roads were financed directly from the General Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury. The 1956 Act directed federal fuel tax to the fund to be used exclusively for highway construction and maintenance. The Highway Revenue Act mandated a tax of three cents per gallon. The original Highway Revenue Act was set to expire at the end of fiscal year 1972. In the 1950s <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> was increased to four cents. The 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act, approved by President Ronald Reagan in January 1983, increased the tax to nine cents with one cent going into a new Mass Transit Account to support public transport.
