The first part of chapter one introduces the general characteristics and reactivity of <b>thioacids,</b> and describes their potential for application to the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins. The second part of chapter one overviews the solution and solid-phase synthesis of peptidyl <b>thioacids</b> and thioesters. The last section of chapter one reviews the importance of tetramic acid containing natural products, and the various methods for their formation, and continues with an overview of stereoselective methods for â-mannosylation, such as are required for the total synthesis of virgineone, a novel glycosylated tetramic acid containing natural product. The second chapter describes studies focused on {{the development of}} a methodology for the synthesis of amino and peptidyl <b>thioacids</b> based on the cleavage of the 9 -fluorenylmethyl (Fm) group from 9 -fluorenlylmethyl thioesters. Subsequently, the formation of native amide bonds in the reaction between C-terminal peptidyl <b>thioacids</b> and electron deficient N-terminal 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulfonamides is presented. In chapter three, building on the method for the solution-phase synthesis of amino and peptidyl <b>thioacids</b> described in chapter two, the development of a 9 -fluorenlylmethyl thioester based linker, N-[9 -(tritylthiomethyl) - 9 H-fluoren- 2 -yl]succinamic acid is described. The use of this linker for the synthesis of peptidyl <b>thioacids</b> on solid support employing Boc-SPPS is then demonstrated. In chapter four, continuing the theme of the development of the chemistry of <b>thioacids,</b> a method for the in situ generation of <b>thioacids</b> by the regioselective ring opening of â-thiolactones is set out. To further explore this concept, investigations were conducted on the ring-opening of various â-thiolactones with soft aromatic thiolates to form thiocarboxylates, with subsequent trapping in-situ by Mukaiyama 2 ̆ 7 s reagent or Sanger 2 ̆ 7 s reagent in presence of an amine to form amide bonds. In chapter five, studies toward the assignment of configuration and the total synthesis of vigineone are described. A practical synthetic route to various stereoisomers of virgineone is elaborated.

D.), Department of Chemistry, Washington State UniversityHerein is {{described}} the Aziridine-Mediated Ligation's discovery, conceptual development, {{and the efforts}} to develop a general synthetic method for the synthesis of unprotected peptide chains terminated in an aziridine. The Aziridine Mediated Ligation is a chemical ligation of a C-terminal <b>thioacid</b> and N-terminal aziridinyl peptide {{in the presence of}} active copper(II) ion. The process was demonstrated to be chemoselective for the desired reaction {{in the presence of a}} wide array of other free functional groups under denaturing aqueous conditions. It is proposed that the copper(II) activates the C-terminal <b>thioacid,</b> creating a water-stable "active ester" which shows an enhanced reactivity for aziridines over a typical amine. The scope of the Aziridine-Mediated Ligation is limited because of the difficulties synthesizing and isolating unprotected aziridinyl peptides from aqueous media. A thorough examination of known protecting groups led to the discovery of a photo-released precursor to the aziridine coupling partner, which readily participates in the Aziridine-Mediated Ligation. The photolysis by-products appear to be inert to the Aziridine-Mediated Ligation as well. The stability of the aziridinyl peptide derivatives to harsh aqueous acidic conditions has also been established, providing a proof-of-principle that this method will be compatible with standard 9 -fluoronylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) -based solid phase peptide synthesis techniques.

40|$|Both {{organic and}} {{inorganic}} sulfur {{play an important}} role in fundamental contemporary biochemistry, suggesting that life's common ancestor used sulfur in its metabolism. In support of this idea is the widely held belief that present-day sulfurmetabolising thermophilic bacteria are the most primitive organisms within the biosphere. This thesis postulates that sulfur may have been important in the origins of life, and reports investigates several interesting and potentially prebiotic reactions involving sulfur. Three different types of chemistry were investigated. The formation of pyrophosphate from phosphate with thioesters over metal phosphate precipitates has been reported; this can be considered a biomimic of the important succinyl-CoA synthetase-catalysed reaction in the citric acid cycle of present-day organisms. The ability of ferrous sulfide and/or ferrous phosphate precipitates to catalyse pyrophosphate production with thioesters or metal ion-bound <b>thioacids</b> as condensing agents was investigated. No pyrophosphate production was detected, but interesting results regarding the effect of ferrous ions in solution and ferrous sulfide precipitates and ferrous phosphate precipitates on the rate of hydrolysis of thioacetic acid are reported. Ferrous ion- and sulfide ion-mediated redox chemistry of thioesters and metal-ion bound <b>thioacids</b> was investigated. The motivation for these experiments came from the involvement of thioesters in contemporary biochemical redox reactions. No ferrous ion- or sulfide ion-dependent redox chemistry was demonstrated. Finally amide bond formation between amines and metal ion-bound <b>thioacids</b> was investigated. It was discovered that nickel sulfide precipitates are efficient catalysts in this process.

The {{second part of the}} thesis is concerned with verification of the structure of a nonprotein antifreeze oligosaccharide by the total synthesis of various authentic oligosaccharides and the comparison of spectroscopic data. Chapter one starts with the introduction of the general characteristics and reactivity of thioacids, and their potential for application to the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins. It continues with an overview of the solution and solid-phase synthesis of peptidyl thioacids and thioesters, and problems associated with them. Finally the chapter ends with an overview of cyclic thioanhydrides with emphasis on the potential for exploration of thiomaleic anhydride. Chapter two of part one describes a series of multicomponent coupling reactions starting from thiomaleic anhydride. These processes begin either by Michael addition, radical addition, or cycloaddition onto the alkene and, following deprotection of a latent nucleophile in the adducts, continue with cylization onto the anhydride and concomitant liberation of a <b>thioacid.</b> Finally the <b>thioacid</b> is captured in a range of a amide or carbon carbon bond forming processes. In this manner a range of thiazines, benzothiazines, lactones, lactams, and oxazatricyclodecanes were prepared efficiently. Chapter three extends a type of multicomponent coupling processes described in chapter two by the replacement of thiomaleic anhydride with various substituted thiitaconic anhydrides. To this end an efficient synthesis of substituted thioitaconic anhydride was first developed. Applying similar protocols to those developed with thiomaleic anhydride then enabled the synthesis of a range of thiazepines, benzothiazepins, and lactams. The experimental procedures and characterization data for the all synthesized compounds discussed in part one of this dissertation are documented in chapter four. Part two of this dissertation starts with chapter five which presents a brief overview of antifreeze substances before focusing on the ambiguous structure of a novel antifreeze oligosaccharide isolated recently from the Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides. The chapter continues with an overview of a chemistry necessary for the synthesis of assorted oligosaccharides necessary for the verification of structure of the substance. Chapter six opens with the retro synthetic analysis of mimics of the oligosaccharide by a convergent route before outlining the actual synthesis. Tetra, hexa, and octa saccharides corresponding to a proposed structure were synthesized along with tetrasaccharyl mimics of various possible linkage isomers.

The second part of chapter one presents the challenges inherent in the synthesis of peptidyl thioesters by Fmoc-SPPS.

The superiority of this new chemistry over available methods is illustrated through direct comparisons in the block synthesis of an octapeptide. In chapter three, studies carried out to probe the reactivity of N-terminal sulfonamides towards peptidyl <b>thioacids</b> are presented. Studies directed at determining the optimal sulfonamide for use in convergent multiple peptide fragment ligation are presented as is the application of these sulfonamides in both left to right and right to left block synthesis of peptides [...] Model studies on {{the development of a}}n intramolecular variant of the thioacid/sulfonamide coupling are also presented in this chapter.

40|$|The total {{chemical}} synthesis of proteins has {{great potential for}} increasing {{our understanding of the}} molecular basis of protein function. The introduction of native chemical ligation techniques to join unprotected peptides next to a cysteine residue has greatly facilitated the synthesis of proteins of moderate size.

This organic functionality has demonstrated many challenges regarding chemical manipulation and reaction efficiency. In the first part of the dissertation the intent is to address carbon functionalization of thiophene substrates by means of Brook rearrangement.

As glycosylation is integral to many biological processes, studies in this area provide valuable and far reaching insights. Herein is described the chemoselective Cu(II) -HOBt promoted chemical ligation of glycosylamines and peptide thioacids to give N-glycosylated peptides. The method is distinguished from other chemical approaches to peptide N-glycosylation in that: (1) it can be employed {{in the presence of}} unprotected N-terminal and Lys sidechain amines, (2) it is remarkably fast, going to completion in under 30 minutes, and (3) it produces glycopeptide without attendant aspartimide formation. The N-glycoligation is exemplified by the coupling of chitobiosylamine and an unprotected heptapeptide containing an aspartyl <b>thioacid</b> side-chain to produce an N-linked glycopeptide corresponding to a truncated segment of a human glycoprotein hormone. The N-glycoligation provides a simple and convergent means for attaching a carbohydrate to a specific Asp residue in an unprotected peptide. Full realization of the benefits of site specific N-glycoligation requires practical methods for the synthesis of unprotected aspartic thioacids containing peptides.

Bibliography: leaves 129 - 137. ix, 137 l illusMetal {{complexes}} {{of several}} α-aminothioacids {{have been prepared}} and characterized. The ligands employed {{in this study were}} the <b>thioacid</b> analogs of α-aminoacids and included thioglycine (tg). DL-thiovaline (tv). DL-β-phenylthioalanine (pta). DL-thiomethionine (tm), and thioisoleucine (ti) (a mixture of isomers). The ligands' general structure is that of the zwitter ion RCH(NH 3) COSˉ. Red, sparingly soluble nickel(II) complexes were prepared from each of the ligands. and in all cases only one product was obtained regardless of the stoichiometric amounts of reactants involved. The elemental analysis indicate that the complexes are the one metal to two ligand species, bis (thioglycinato) nickel(II) [Ni(tg) 2], bis(thiovalinato) nickel(II) [Ni(tv) 2], bis(β-phenylthioalaninato) nickel(II) [Ni(pta) 2], bis(thiomethioninato) nickel(II) [Ni(tm) 2], and bis(thioisoleucinato) nickel(II) [Ni(ti) 2]. The low conductivity of these compounds indicate a nonelectrolyte, molecular structure. The magnetic moments and the electronic spectra corresponds to the supposition that the donor atoms are arranged in a square planar configuration surrounding the nickel ions. The complexes can exist in either the cis (I) or trans (II) form. Unfortunately, the very slight solubility of these 'complexes rendered the methods usually employed to distinguish between m and trans configurations experimentally infeasible. However, an x-ray analysis is presently in progress in these laboratories to determine the absolute structure of the nickel-thioglycine complex. Attempts to S-alkylate the ligands as either the free acids or while coordinated to the nickel atom failed. Also, efforts to form thiobridged complexes were unsuccessful. The reaction of cobalt(II) acetate with thioglycine produced an extremely insoluble, dark maroom complex of the composition Co(tg) 2. The magnetic measurements suggest that the compound may be antiferromagnetic, indicating some sort of metal-metal orbital interaction, perhaps by a Co-S-Co delocalization or a direct Co-Co bond. Efforts to obtain cobalt complexes with the remaining ligands were unsuccessful. The metal ions Pt(II), Pd(II) and Cu(II) caused decomposition of the ligands. The reaction of the ligands with copper(II) bromide generated colorless solutions which indicated the formation of Cu(I) as an intermediate in the decomposition of the ligands. A potentiometric study over a range of temperatures was undertaken to determine the dissociation constants of thioglycine and the stability constants of the nickel(II) -thioglycine complex, as well as the thermodynamic values of these reactions. This system was then compared with the nickel(II) -glycine system. The Ka for thioglycine is much greater than the Ka for glycine. Also, Kb is larger for thioglycine than for glycine. Regardless of these facts, the nickel-thioglycine system forms a more stable complex than the corresponding nickel-glycine system. The K 2 for the nickel-thioglycine system is actually larger than the K 1. The thermodynamic data indicate that this phenomenon is an entropy effect probably caused by the change in configuration from an octahedral environment to a square planar one for the nickel ion...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the reaction of benzoic acid with cyclohexyl isonitrile leading to N-cyclohexyl-N-formylbenzamide has been studied quantitatively. The reaction is first order in each reagent and has the activation parameters delta H = 16. 9 (5) kcal mol- 1 and delta S = 26 (1) cal mol- 1 K- 1 in toluene. There is a dramatic solvent effect: hydrogen bond accepting solvents retard {{the rate of the}} reaction by deactivation of the carboxylic acid. A plot of log(rate constant) vs beta (hydrogen bond acceptor basicity of the solvent) is a straight line with a substantial negative slope, implying that the reaction is retarded by hydrogen bonding to the solvent but not affected significantly by other solvent properties. It is speculated that the related Passerini reaction is affected in a similar matter, although quantitative data for this reaction are sparse in the literature. Variation of concentrations allows control over the product distribution in the reaction of carboxylic acids and isonitriles. With low concentrations of the acid, the N-formylamide is obtained in good yield because low concentrations suppress the nucleophilic interception of the intermediate formimidate carboxylate mixed anhydrides (FCMAs), which leads to the undesired anhydride and formamide. With arylacetic acids, N-formylamides (the products of a unimolecular process) are obtained with low concentrations of the reactants and high reaction temperatures. At low temperatures and high concentrations, captodative alkenes (the products of a bimolecular process) are obtained instead. In contrast to the high temperatures needed for RNC + RCO 2 H [...] N-formylamide, thioacids react at ambient temperature with isonitriles to give N-thioformylamides. Transient intermediates can be observed during the reaction. Two thio-analogues of the FCMA are suggested by NMR spectral evidence. However, the structure of a third intermediate (which forms more slowly than the other two) remains unknown. Several mechanisms for this reaction are kinetically indistinguishable because the three intermediates interchange more rapidly than the product-forming step (which is irreversible). The solvent effect observed with carboxylic acids is not observed with thioacids, presumably because of the weaker hydrogen bond donating strength of the S-H in the <b>thioacid.</b> The mechanism and temperature dependence of the hydride ring opening of a phenyl azetidinium cation has been studied. The reaction with CpRu(dppm) H (dppm = bis(diphenylphosphino) methane) is first order in both the hydride and the azetidinium. Extrapolation of the rate constant to - 64 °C (the temperature at which an analogous aziridinium ring opening was previously examined) shows that aziridiniums undergo hydride ring opening 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 times faster. This result implies that aziridiniums are much more electrophilic than azetidiniums, although these two rings have a strain energy difference of only 2. 1 kcal mol- 1. Nucleophilic attack on azetidiniums generally occurs at the less substituted position in accords with an SN 2 mechanism. However, with a phenyl substituent, hydride transfer by half-sandwich ruthenium complexes occurs preferentially at the more substituted position (ca. 5 : 1) giving the straight-chain amine. More reactive hydrides (borohydrides, LiAlH 4) erode this preference. As is the case with electrophilicity, there is {{a significant difference in the}} reduction potential between a phenyl aziridinium (Epc = - 0. 93 V vs FcH+/FcH) and a phenyl azetidinium (Epc = - 1. 43 V). While the phenyl aziridinium has been previously shown to undergo single electron reduction by Cp*Ru(dppf) H (E 1 / 2 = - 0. 63 V, dppf = 1, 1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene), the phenyl azetidinium failed to react with the same reagent. The azetidinium did react with decamethylcobaltocene (E 1 / 2 = - 1. 94 V) giving the expected straight-chain ring-opened amine among a mixture of products; none of the branched amine was detected...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{alternatives}} {{concerning the}} origin of life: the origin may be heterotrophic or autotrophic. The central problem within the theory of an autotrophic origin is the first process of carbon fixation. I here propose the hypothesis that this process is an autocatalytic cycle that can be retrodictively constructed from the extant reductive citric acid cycle by replacing thioesters by <b>thioacids</b> and by assuming that the required reducing power is obtained from the oxidative formation of pyrite (FeS 2). This archaic cycle is strictly chemoautotrophic: photoautotrophy is not required. The cycle is catalytic for pyrite formation and autocatalytic for its own multiplication. It {{is a consequence of}} this hypothesis that the postulated cycle cannot exist as a single isolated cycle but must be a member of a network of concatenated homologous cycles, from which all anabolic pathways appear to have sprung...|$|R
40|$|Oxo-dipeptides and thio-dipeptides {{are built}} via {{condensation}} between couples of amino acids and amino <b>thioacids,</b> the latter with the carbonyl oxygen {{replaced by an}} sp(2) sulfur. We explored via in silico methods (PBE 0 / 6 - 31 G(d,p) and PBE 0 / 6 - 311 G(d,p)) all the possible combinations and built 800 dipeptides, whose structures were fully optimized. Maps of condensation energies are presented to highlight optimal partners leading to stable dipeptides and critical situations for which lower stability or instability is predicted in terms of Gibbs reaction free energies. To validate the feasibility of our computational investigation, we synthesized and compared the stabilities of two thionated dimers, namely -Gly[psi(CSNH) ]Gly- and -PheN(psi(CSNH) Phe-, characterized by diverging physico-chemical properties.

40|$|As an {{expansion}} to the wet chemical route for {{the preparation of}} quantum-sized II-VI semiconductor materials, a series of thiol-capped crystalline CdSe nanoparticles has been synthesized in aqueous solution using mercapto-alcohols (2 -mercaptoethanol, 1 -thioglycerol), and mercapto acids (thioglycolic acid, thiolactic acid) as stabilizers. The smaller (app. 1. 4 - 2. 2 nm diameter) CdSe particles were obtained using thioalcohols as capping agents; the use of <b>thioacids</b> as stabilizers produced larger (2. 1 - 3. 2 nm diameter) CdSe particles. CdSe nanoparticles were separated from the crude solutions as redissolvable powder samples with narrow size distributions using a size-selective fractionation and have been characterized by UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.
