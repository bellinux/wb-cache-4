500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Holst wrote the Choral Fantasia (1930) and he was {{commissioned}} by the BBC to write a piece for military band; the resulting prelude and scherzo Hammersmith was a tribute to the place where he had spent most of his life. The composer and critic Colin Matthews considers the work [...] "as uncompromising in its way as Egdon Heath, discovering, in the words of Imogen Holst, 'in the middle of an over-crowded London... the same tranquillity that he had found in <b>the</b> <b>solitude</b> <b>of</b> Egdon Heath'". The work was unlucky in being premiered at a concert that also featured the London premiere of Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, by which it was somewhat overshadowed.|$|E
500|$|On January 18, 1892, {{about ten}} years before she died, Stanton joined Anthony, Stone, and Isabella Beecher Hooker {{to address the issue}} of {{suffrage}} before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. After nearly five decades of fighting for female suffrage and women's rights, it was Elizabeth Cady Stanton's final appearance before members of the United States Congress. Using the text of what became <b>The</b> <b>Solitude</b> <b>of</b> Self, she spoke of the central value of the individual, noting that value was not based on gender. As with the Declaration of Sentiments she had penned some 45 years earlier, Stanton's statement expressed not only the need for women's voting rights in particular, but the need for a revamped understanding of women's position in society and even of women in general: ...|$|E
500|$|Stanton went on {{to write}} {{some of the most}} {{influential}} books, documents, and speeches of the women's rights movement. Starting in 1876, Stanton, Anthony, and Gage collaborated to write the first volume of History of Woman Suffrage, a path-breaking, six-volume work containing the full history, documents, and letters of the woman's suffrage movement. The first two volumes were published in 1881 and the third in 1886; the work was eventually completed in 1922 by Ida Harper. Stanton's other major writings included the two-part The Woman's Bible, published in 1895 and 1898; Eighty Years & More: Reminiscences 1815–1897, her autobiography, published in 1898; and <b>The</b> <b>Solitude</b> <b>of</b> Self, or [...] "Self-Sovereignty," [...] which she first delivered as a speech at the 1892 convention of the National American Woman's Suffrage Association in Washington, D.C.|$|E

500|$|Byrnes {{found that}} Departures used {{the symbol of}} the cherry blossom, a flower which blooms after the winter only to wither soon afterwards, to {{represent}} the transience of life; through this understanding, he wrote, Japanese people attempt to define their own existence. Natural symbols are further presented through the changing seasons, which [...] "suggest delicate emotional changes" [...] in the characters, as well as the letter-stones, which represent [...] "love, communication, [...] the baton being passed from generation to generation". The film's settings are used to convey various sensations, including <b>the</b> <b>solitude</b> <b>of</b> the countryside and the intimacy of the public bath house. The colour white, manifested through snow, chrysanthemums, and other objects, is prominent in the film; Okuyama suggests that this, together with the classical music and ritualized hand gestures, represents the sacredness and purity of the death ceremonies.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez was {{inspired}} to write a dictator novel when he witnessed the flight of Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez. He shares, [...] "it {{was the first time}} we had seen a dictator fall in Latin America." [...] García Márquez began writing Autumn of the Patriarch (El otoño del patriarca) in 1968 and said it was finished in 1971; however, he continued to embellish the dictator novel until 1975 when it was published in Spain. According to García Márquez, the novel is a [...] "poem on <b>the</b> <b>solitude</b> <b>of</b> power" [...] as it follows the life of an eternal dictator known as the General. The novel is developed through a series of anecdotes related to the life of the General, which do not appear in chronological order. Although the exact location of the story is not pin-pointed in the novel, the imaginary country is situated somewhere in the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|Cooper was {{naturally}} reserved and introspective, {{and loved}} <b>the</b> <b>solitude</b> <b>of</b> outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences {{with an occasional}} [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E

2500|$|With a new {{position}} as Director of the Wilderness Society, Murie would continue to fight for and defend existing national parks. Murie relied on techniques that stressed the economic value of national preservation sites because he knew {{this was the most}} effective way to appeal to America’s public. For instance, in the case of Jackson Hole National Monument, he emphasized how new tourism was contributing to Jackson's local economy. [...] Murie would go on to advocate for the preservation of many additional parks from human development. He believed that those who wished to [...] "seek <b>the</b> <b>solitude</b> <b>of</b> the primitive forest" [...] should have the ability to do so and that a democratic society should protect this right.|$|E

During seasons or days of fasting, just one meal is provided. The hermit makes his needs known to the lay brother by means of a note, requesting items such as a fresh loaf of bread, which will be kept in the cell for eating with several meals.

He stays with the Buendías and begins to write the mysterious parchments, which are eventually translated by Aureliano Babilonia, and prophesy the House of Buendia's end. Melquíades dies a second time from drowning in the river near Macondo and, following a grand ceremony organized by the Buendías, is the first individual buried in Macondo. His name echoes Melchizedek in the Old Testament, whose source of authority as a high priest was mysterious.|$|E
