40|$|The {{idea that}} the final {{distribution}} of the tax burden (economic incidence) {{does not depend on}} the initial distribution of tax liabilities (statutory incidence) {{is referred to as the}} Liability Side Equivalence principle. This paper tests this principle in the laboratory and finds that subjects who actually have to pay the tax carry a higher tax burden. It is argued that this violation of Liability Side Equivalence is due to the fact that a change in the distribution of tax liabilities induces a shift in behaviorally relevant social norms. This shift, in turn, affects the impact of the tax. Our results explain some striking empirical observations and have important theoretical and practical implications. <b>Tax</b> <b>equivalence,</b> Tax incidence, Social norms. ...|$|E

In a simple model with symmetric sectors, it is shown that introducing labor mobility reduces the wage level, and thereby also unemployment.

The finding in the literature that {{an increase in the}} fraction of unemployment costs borne by the own sector reduces the wage level is shown to hold when labor is mobile as well. Another result is that wage costs in general are higher when unemployment benefits are financed through pay-roll taxes compared to the case when they are financed through income taxes.

By contrast, policymakers and the public often mistake statutory incidence for economic incidence. Using competitive laboratory markets, I test both <b>tax</b> incidence <b>equivalence</b> and an analogous theorem for subsidies. For sufficiently large markets, the results show strong support for both theories; {{there is little to}} no evidence, even in the short run, of the popular misperception that statutory incidence equals economic incidence.

40|$|Is a {{consumption}} tax {{equivalent to a}} wage tax? This article examines this question in a two-period life-cycle model with Cobb-Douglas production and utility functcons. Three taxes are compared: income, wage, and consumption. The article shows how equivalence depends crucially on government debt policy. If the government varies the government-debt/capital-stock ratio so that each tax achieves the same steady-state capital per worker, then the {{consumption tax}} {{is equivalent to the}} wage tax: The representative individual chooses the same consumption path and attains the same lifetime utility. However, if the government maintains the same debt/capital ratio under the three taxes, then the consumption tax is not equivalent to the wage tax: The consumption tax achieves a higher capital per worker than the income tax, while the wage tax achieves a lower capital per worker, and the representative individual chooses a different consumption path under all three taxes. Econo-mists should therefore indicate the crucial role of government debt policy in any discussion of <b>tax</b> <b>equivalence...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{equilibrium}} {{models of}} unemployment, e. g. efficiency wage models, {{the level of}} unemployment generally depends {{on the level of}} taxes on labor (see. e. g. Johnson and Layard (1986) and Pisauro (1991)). Considering labor taxes levied on firms, the tax authorities may choose between employment and payroll taxes where the former is a head tax on the number of employees while the latter is a tax on the cost of labor to firms. Pisauro (1991) has shown in a short run efficiency wage model that the incidence of employment and payroll taxes generally differ and, in particular, that employment taxes lead to less wage restraint than payroll taxes. Extending his model to the long run by allowing for free entry and exit of firms we go one step further and consider whether changes in the composition of labor taxes, balancing the government budget, affect equilibrium unemployment in the long run. Our results reveat that, perhaps somewhat surprisingly given the result that payroll taxes lead to more wage restraint than employment taxes, that more extensive use of employment taxes instead of payroll taxes, balancing the government budget, increases the level of employment and decreases unemployment.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{equivalence}} between taxation and emission permits according to different viewpoints: the first one sets prices, the second one quantities. But equivalence is more formal than substantial: taxation is the generating fact, the market of permits does not exist spontaneously. Its price is unstable because supply is not independent from demand. It is manipulatable either ex ante when free allowances are allocated or ex post {{during the period of}} compliance through Walrasian tatonnement. A real economic determination of prices exists only when there are unit taxes or penalties on emissions exceeding the quotas. In order to avoid these drawbacks, pay-as-bid auctions must be used and free allowances avoided. Taxation or the price of emission permits are the real option value of changing techniques. An assignment rule is proposed : taxes are assigned to reduce average emissions and permits to reduce marginal emissions. In order to transform the cost into a real change of techniques, it is necessary to finance the sector of research and development of an amount greater than the taxes levied on pollution, which serve at paying the rent of innovation. These extra subsidies are used to move factors of production as capital from industry towards the innovation sector. The <b>tax</b> <b>equivalence</b> is ternary and concerns the taxes on pollution, capital and energy, because extracting fossil fuels is similar as innovation. Decentralization through market schemes induces that depollution has a marketable cost. ...|$|E

40|$|Apart {{from this}} text, {{you may want}} to read Chari and Kehoe (1998). The problem of optimal taxation—how to raise a given a amount of revenue at least social cost—can be {{approached}} in different ways. The approach here, following Ramsey (1927) is to suppose that taxes must be proportional to income and/or consumption. In particular, lump-sum taxes are ruled out. No theoretical foundations are given for this particular taxation scheme. More precisely, the solution concept is the following. The Ramsey optimal allocation is that allocation that delivers the highest weighted sum of utilities among those allocations that form part of some competitive equilibrium. Notice that the proportionality of taxes is built in the concept of competitive equilibrium. Non-proportional taxes mean that people face different after-tax prices, and that is not consistent with competitive equilibrium. A competitive equilibrium consists of an allocation and after-tax prices. Alternatively, and perhaps more intuitively, we can think of it as having three parts: an allocation, pre-tax prices 1 and tax rates. In this context {{it is important to understand}} that a given allocation is not associated with a unique set of tax rates. It can easily happen that the same equilibrium allocation is supported by distinct tax rates. This phenomenon is known as <b>tax</b> <b>equivalence.</b> To see how this might work, consider an environment where a representative agent maximizes 1 ∑ t= 0 βtu(ct, ℓt) subject to ht = 1 − ℓt (1 + τ ct) ct + kt+ 1 = (1 − τ kt) rtkt + (1 − τht) wtht, k 0 given and some suitable No Ponzi Scheme constraint.

40|$|In recent years, {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to replace the federal income tax with a postpaid consumption tax - that is, a federal value added tax (2 ̆ 2 VAT 2 ̆ 2), a federal retail sales tax (2 ̆ 2 RST 2 ̆ 2), or a federal cash-flow (consumed income) tax. Because these taxes can be constructed so that they are indistinguishable {{at the level of the}} ultimate consumer in terms of their principal effects, and because a prominent recent proposal is the RST approach, I have written this article in terms of an RST/income tax comparison. The analysis, however, would be mostly the same if the income tax was compared with the other forms of postpaid consumption taxes. Commentators and analysts have often noted that complete replacement of the federal income tax with a consumption tax regime would cause a substantial downward shifting of the federal tax burden to low and middle income taxpayers. This article, however, does not deal with that important point. Instead, it argues that complete replacement would create an unlimited federal obligation to match all private saving, regardless of the amount or purpose of that saving and regardless of the saver 2 ̆ 7 s income level, and that the wealthiest taxpayers would benefit from the largest match. This argument produces a new lens through which to examine other facets of the income tax versus consumption tax debate and this scrutiny shows that a postpaid consumption tax with progressive rates arguably does not impose any greater burden on investment income than a flat-rate postpaid consumption tax and that the wage tax/postpaid consumption <b>tax</b> <b>equivalence</b> is not essential to an understanding of the effects of a postpaid consumption tax. Using the new lens, the article also re-examines familiar matters that are generally related to the debate over whether investment income is taxed once under a comprehensive income tax and not at all under a postpaid consumption tax, or is taxed twice under a comprehensive income tax and once under a postpaid consumption tax. I conclude that within its premises, the income tax does not double-tax investment income...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} fiscal policies in an open economy when international financial markets are well developed. Consumers use these markets to hedge against the risk of uncertain future changes in government policies. These portfolio allocations alter the effects of changes in government policies, if and when they occur, as compared to a world with more limited financial markets. Three examples are discussed. The first involves a change in (productive) government spending, financed by a change in lump-sum taxes, in a large open economy with two goods. The second example concerns the effects of temporary changes in distorting taxes. The final example concerns the open-economy effects of changes in government deficits, due to changes in lump-sum <b>taxes,</b> without Ricardian <b>equivalence.</b> In each example the existence of opportunities to trade on well-developed international financial markets is shown to alter, in important ways, the effects of changes in government policies.

Using a survey method, this paper attempts to reveal how fairness norms affect the incidence of subsidy both in the short-run and long-run. The results indicate that statutory incidence (legal right to receive subsidy) affects people’s fairness norms on who should receive subsidy. In particular it is considered unfair for a firm to receive a part of the subsidy when it is legally granted to the consumer side. If firms avoid behaviors that are considered unfair, the <b>tax</b> and subsidy <b>equivalence</b> theorem may not hold under this situation. The survey results also reveal that fairness norms affect the incidence of subsidy in the long-run, in a sense that the allocation of gains that are generated due to subsidy is affected. People find it fair if allocation is made in proportion to firms’ own effort. Therefore, if an increase in profit is achieved by activities directly supported by subsidy, people find it less justifiable for firms to keep all the gains by themselves and thus firms may be forced to share the gains with consumers...|$|R

Households may have some private information either about their type (adverse selection) or about some action levei chosen in the first period that affects the probability of certain states of nature in the second period (moral hazard). Trade of financiai assets are intermediated by a finite collection of banks. Banks objective functions are determined in equilibrium by shareholders. Due to private information it may be optimal for the banks to introduce constraints in the set of available portfolios for each household as wellas household specific asset prices. In particular, households may face distinct interest rates for holding the risk-free asset. The government finances its expenditures either by taxing households in the first period or by issuing bonds in the first period and taxing households in the second period. Taxes may be state-dependent. Suppose government policies are neutml: i) government policies do not affect the distribution of wealth across households; and ii) if the government decides to tax a household in the second period there is a portfolio available for the banks that generates the Mme payoff in each state of nature as the household <b>taxes.</b> Tben, Ricardian <b>equivalence</b> holds if and only if an appropriate boundary condition is satisfied.

40|$|Like in all {{countries}} in transition, the tax {{as well as}} the transfer system have been under serious reform pressures. The socialistic systems were not able to fulfill the necessary functions in providing a certain degree of redistribution and social security, which are inevitable for social oriented market economies. Increasing income and wage differentiation {{is one of the most}} important prerequisites for a market oriented ability to pay tax system. But in the transformation period, numerous quasi-legal or even illegal property transactions have taken place, thus leading to wealth concentrations on the one hand while as consequence of the bankruptcy of socialism, enormous poverty problems have arisen on the other. For the political acceptance of the transformation process it is of utmost importance that an efficient and fair tax system is implemented and social security is organised by the state on a level which secures at least the physical minimum of subsistence or – if economically possible – even a social-cultural minimum. Whether the state should go further in providing compulsory social insurance systems has been a hotly debated topic for decades even in the welfare and social states of the Western type. Whereas the basic security systems have to be financed by general tax revenue, for a compulsory social insurance system – due to the insurance character – special earmarked social security contribution are held necessary. Both public goods and services as well as at least basic security have to be financed by total tax revenue. For the acceptance and fairness of the whole system the total redistributive effect of both sides of the budget – the tax system {{as well as the}} expenditure system – are decisive. In this paper we will concentrate on the revenue side, e. g. on the taxes as well as on the social security contributions. Adam Smith had already formulated some very simple tax norms which have been transformed in modern <b>tax</b> theory. The <b>equivalence</b> as well as the ability-topay principle are basic yardsticks for every tax system in a democratic oriented market system, not to forget tax fairness. In the historical development process equity-oriented measures have often produced an enormous complexity of the single taxes as well as of the whole tax system. Therefore, reconsidering the Smithian principles of simplicity and of minimum compliance costs for the tax payer would even press many Western European tax systems to undergo serious reform processes which often are delayed because of intense interest group influence. Hence, a modern tax system is a simple one which consists only of a few single taxes which are easy to administer. Such a system consists of two main taxes, the income and the value added tax. Consequently in {{all countries}} of transition both taxes have been implemented, while the implementation was fostered by the fact that both also constitute the typical components of the EU member states systems. Therefore such a harmonising tax reform is the most important prerequisite to become a membership candidate. Bulgaria also tried to follow this general pattern in reforming the income tax system starting in 1992 and replacing the old socialistic turnover tax and excise duty system by the value added tax (VAT) in 1994. Especially with regard to the income tax system the demand for simplicity has not been met yet. Complex rules to define the tax base as well as a steeply progressive tax schedule have led to behavioral adaptations which are even strengthened by the effects of a high social contribution burden which is predominantly laid on the employers. In the following some concise descriptions of the tax and social contribution system are given; the paper closes with a summary, in which the impacts of the system are evaluated and some political recommendations for further reforms are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{dissertation}} is Ricardian equivalence, and its objective {{is to examine the}} effects of government debt on private consumption expenditures (Essay One), on interest rates (Essay Two), on the current account balance (Essay Three), and on individual intertemporal decision-making (Essay Four). The effects of government debt are important if debt is neutral (e. g., if “Ricardian equivalence” holds), then a stabilization program that is based on demand management policy to curtail fiscal deficits will not be operative. On the other hand, if debt is not neutral (or if Ricardian equivalence does not hold), then deficit finance may induce private consumption, boost interest rates, crowd out investment, and retard economic growth. Essay One contributes to the existing literature by taking into account the nature of liquidity constraints in a developing economy in an aggregate consumption function. Previous empirical tests on Ricardian equivalence have not considered the role of a dominant resource aspect of a country. Essay Two and Essay Three incorporate a dominant resource aspect in Indonesia by estimating the oil-macroeconomic relationship. Furthermore, Essay Three takes into account the role of capital inflows by including debt securities. Essay Four uses experimental economics methods to examine the role of distortionary <b>taxes</b> on Ricardian <b>equivalence.</b> There have been only a few studies that use an experimental approach to examine the effect of deficit spending on consumption expenditures, but these existing experimental studies ignore the role of distortionary taxes in affecting subjects’ consumption-saving decisions and focus on the presence of liquidity constraints, myopia, and uncertainty on future income. Essay Four contributes to the Ricardian equivalence literature by taking into account distortionary taxes in a Ricardian institution by levying taxes on savings in an intertemporal individual consumption-savings decision in laboratory experiments. By utilizing the aggregate consumption function and the Euler equation consumption function, Essay One shows that Indonesian consumers tend to behave in a non-Ricardian way. Public debt most likely will lead to crowding out of investment, and will retard capital accumulation and economic growth. The extent to which individuals perceive government expenditures as complements for their consumption is substantial. An increase in government expenditures will increase the marginal utility of private consumption and has an expansionary effect on aggregate demand. The complementarity between private consumption and government expenditures may be partly due to the allocation of government subsidies to basic goods and services such as electricity, fuel, fertilizer, health centers, and education. Liquidity constraints may cause consumption to have an excess sensitivity to income. The short-run and long-run aggregate consumption function estimates show that income affects consumption, indicating that consumers follow a “rule of thumb” of consuming their current income. A high ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in Indonesia may also be the culprit of the excess sensitivity of private consumption to income. Due to low salaries in the formal sector, employees have been engaged in moonlighting activities, mostly in the form of self-employment (e. g., opening retail stores or services). This phenomenon may help to explain why private credit−which amounts to 29 percent of GDP−fails to explain consumption behavior. Most loans are made for investment rather than for consumption. Consumers’ behavior is insensitive to taxation, which perhaps is due to the fact that tax enactment is not explicitly revealed in Indonesia (e. g., price tags in the supermarket include the sales tax, and employees are only informed about their after-tax net wage instead of their gross wage). The share of tax collections to GDP averages only about 15 percent. There is still a large portion of the population who do not pay taxes or who pay far below what they should pay. The fiscal authority needs to focus more attention on alternative financing, i. e. taxation, whose system is essential to be enhanced. Essay Two shows that by excluding oil prices, deficits and debt significantly increase the real interest rate, thereby invalidating Ricardian equivalence. The evidence shows some preference for debt and deficit over government expenditures as determinants of interest rates. Inclusion of the oil price weakens the Neoclassical results, providing more support for the Ricardian paradigm. Deficits no longer increase interest rates, yet debt still significantly increases interest rates. This result reflects a loss of momentum for the Indonesian government two decades ago to decrease its dependency on debt. The government could have used the windfall oil revenue to pay off foreign debt; instead, the windfall was spent on import-intensive infrastructure development projects, in order to build domestic industry and to subsidize rice and petroleum products. The importance of oil prices in the interest rate estimation suggests that in modeling the Indonesian macroeconomy, the oil sector should be incorporated. The non-stationary nature of the stock of debt implies the failure of intertemporal budget balance to hold, indicating that the debt-financed deficit is unsustainable. Essay Three shows that around 80 percent of the estimation results provide support for the Neoclassical view, a result that is consistent with the twin deficits hypothesis. The long-run estimates indicate an almost one-to-one relationship between the government budget and the trade balance, while the short-run estimates show a smaller magnitude. When capital inflows are included, the twin deficits phenomenon is less pronounced in the short-run and disappears in the long-run. An increase in the oil price statistically and significantly improves the trade balance in the short-run and in the long-run. Essay Four shows that subjects fully anticipate an increase in future taxation by increasing the amount bequeathed in one-to-one correspondence to the increase in debt. Even under a Ricardian institution, the distorting nature of taxes on savings alters subjects’ consumption-savings decisions. The equality of the change in bequests and the change in deficit spending is not attained under the savings taxes treatment, invalidating Ricardian equivalence. In line with the results of Essays One, Two, and Three, which suggest the vital need to enhance the taxation system, the results of Essay Four entail the importance of taxes on interest income in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|Russell Cooper and Andrew John {{have written}} an {{economics}} text aimed directly at students from its very inception. You’re thinking, ”Yeah, sure. I’ve heard that before. “ This textbook, Economics: Theory Through Applications, centers around student needs and expectations through two premises: …	Students {{are motivated to}} study economics if they see that it relates to their own lives. …	Students learn best from an inductive approach, {{in which they are}} first confronted with a problem, and then led through the process of solving that problem. Many books claim to present economics {{in a way that is}} digestible for students; Russell and Andrew have truly created one from scratch. This textbook will assist you in increasing students’ economic literacy both by developing their aptitude for economic thinking and by presenting key insights about economics that every educated individual should know. How? Russell and Andrew have done three things in this text to accomplish that goal: 1. Applications Ahead of Theory: They present all the theory that is standard in Principles books. But by beginning with applications, students get to learn why this theory is needed. The authors take the kind of material that other authors put in ”applications boxes“ and place it at the heart of their book. Each chapter is built around a particular business or policy application, such as (for microeconomics) minimum wages, the stock exchange, and auctions, and (for macroeconomics), social security, globalization, and the wealth and poverty of nations. Why take this approach? Traditional courses focus too much on abstract theory relative to the interests and capabilities of the average undergraduate. Students are rarely engaged and the formal theory is never integrated into the way students think about economic issues. And traditional books are organized around theoretical constructs that mean nothing to students. The authors’ applications-first approach ensures that students will not see chapters with titles like ”Cost Functions“ or ”Short-Run Fluctuations“. They introduce tools and ideas as and when they are needed. Each chapter is designed with two goals. First, the application upon which the chapter is built provides a ”hook“ that gets students’ attention. Second, the application is a suitable vehicle a vehicle for teaching the principles of economics. 2. Learning through Repetition: Important tools appear over and over again, allowing students to learn from repetition and to see how one framework can be useful in many different contexts. Each piece of economic theory in this text is first introduced and explained in the context of a specific application. Most are re-used in other chapters, so students see them in action on multiple occasions. As students progress through the book, they accumulate a set of techniques and ideas. These are collected separately in a ”toolkit“ that provides students with an easy reference and also gives them a condensed summary of economic principles for examination preparation. 3. A Student’s Table of Contents vs. An Instructor’s Table of Contents: There is no further proof that Russell and Andrew have created a book aimed specifically at educating students about economics than their two tables of contents. The Student’s Table of Contents speaks to students, piquing their interest to involve them in the economics, and a Instructor’s Table of Contents with the economics to better help you organize your teaching—and frankly, you don’t need to get excited by economics, you already are.
