40|$|The {{prevalence}} of MRSA in the <b>turkey</b> meat <b>production</b> chain in Germany was estimated {{within the national}} monitoring for zoonotic agents in 2010.

The specific distributions of spa types, SCCmec types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of MRSA isolated from these three different origins were compared using chi square statistics and the proportional similarity index (Czekanowski index). No significant differences between spa types, SCCmec types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of MRSA from different steps of the German <b>turkey</b> meat <b>production</b> chain were observed using Chi-Square test statistics. The Czekanowski index which can obtain values between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (perfect agreement) was consistently high (0. 79 – 0. 86) for the distribution of spa types and SCCmec types between the different processing stages indicating high degrees of similarity. The comparison of antimicrobial resistance profiles between the different process steps revealed the lowest Czekanowski index values (0. 42 – 0. 56).

40|$|Abstract: The {{socio-economic}} {{situation of the}} country has given rise to increased agricultural activities not only among the civilian population but also among the members of the Nigerian Army. According to World Bank, Poverty in Nigeria has increased dramatically with 66 % of the population living below National Poverty line, compared with 43 % in 1992. This has socio-economic implications to the Nigerian army as well. As a result, many soldiers have resorted to selected agricultural enterprises especially <b>Turkey</b> <b>production</b> as a way of alleviating the economic situation. A total of 60 soldiers covering all the ranks and file of the Nigerian Army were randomly selected from the 82 Division of the Nigerian Army. Four barracks were purposely selected due to their interests in <b>Turkey</b> <b>Production.</b> The barracks include Eburutu Barracks Calabar, Abakpa-Enugu, Zamani lekwot cantonment PH and 82 -Division Records, Abakaliki. Data generated were analyzed using regression analysis, benefit-cost ratio, and descriptive statistic. The major factor that enhanced <b>turkey</b> <b>production</b> among soldiers were income and previous farming experience. The enterprise was not only profitable but also viable. Efforts should be made to encourage more soldiers to embrace this enterprise. Key words: Socio-economic determinants, production systems, <b>Turkey</b> <b>production,</b> Nigerian soldier...|$|E
