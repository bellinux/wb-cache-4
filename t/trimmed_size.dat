40|$|Summary: Chimira is {{a web-based}} system for microRNA (miRNA) {{analysis}} from small RNA-Seq data. Sequences are automatically cleaned, <b>trimmed,</b> <b>size</b> selected and mapped directly to miRNA hair-pin sequences. This generates count-based miRNA expression data for subsequent statistical analysis. Moreover, it {{is capable of}} identi-fying epi-transcriptomic modifications in the input sequences. Sup-ported modification types include multiple types of 3 ’-modifications (e. g. uridylation, adenylation), 5 ’-modifications and also internal modifications or variation (ADAR editing or SNPs). Besides cleaning and mapping of input sequences to miRNAs (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2008), Chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis and interpretation of the results (see also Supplementary material). These allow the visual study of the differential expression between two specific samples or sets of samples, the identification of the most highly expressed miRNAs within sample pairs (or sets of samples) and also the projection of the modification profile for spe-cific miRNAs across all samples. Other tools have already been published in the past for various types of small RNA-Seq analysis, such as UEA workbench, seqBuster, MAGI, OASIS and CAP-miRSeq, CPSS for modifications identification. A comprehensive comparison of Chimira with each of these tools is provided in the Supplemental material. Chimira outperforms all of these tools in total execution speed and aims to facilitate simple, fast and reliable anal-ysis of small RNA-Seq data allowing also, for the first time, identifi-cation of global microRNA modification profiles in a simple intuitive interface. Availability: Chimira has been developed as a web application and it is accessible here...|$|E
50|$|In 2007 the {{interior}} {{layout of the}} devotions was changed, the first {{significant change in the}} layout since its inception. In 2008 the <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> changed to 4+1/8 x 6+1/2 in from its former 4 x 6 in size to accommodate changes in printing technology.|$|R
50|$|All hardcovers {{contain the}} {{contents}} of the comics, including the covers, and in some cases bonus material. The books' <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> is larger than the paperbacks. Each hardcover contains two story arcs from the series. Signed versions of the books are available, each limited to 310 pieces.|$|R
5000|$|The binding cloth is durable woven rayon. The {{books are}} Smyth-sewn for {{permanence}} and flexibility, and each includes a ribbon marker.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to having little introductory/orientation material (every NFT simply begins with an introductory letter, a table of contents, and then a map of each neighborhood for that city), NFT differs from other guides in that its <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> is variable—the New York City guide is pocket-sized, while the Los Angeles guide is quite larger as {{it is meant to}} be used as a driving/navigational tool in {{addition to}} a basic reference. Cities such as Chicago and Washington, DC have a <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> that is in between that of the pocket guides and the larger Los Angeles guide. NFT states that each of its guides' sizes is based solely on the [...] "coverage area" [...] for each city—San Francisco being close to 50 sq mi, for instance, and Los Angeles covering close to 500 sq mi. Los Angeles has five times the population of San Francisco.|$|R
50|$|Casting off {{generally}} {{begins by}} counting the words or {{characters in the}} manuscript, usually using a word processor or text editor.

50|$|The {{magazine}} {{was first published}} in March 1981; the first editor was Marcia P. Sward, who held that position until September 1985. Beginning in 2009 the magazine is published six times a year; previously it was published nine times a year. The magazine is printed on glossy paper with a final <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> of 8-1/4 inches wide by 10-5/8 inches high. Circulation in 2008 was 22,400 copies.|$|R

25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck cases, will stretch upon firing. How much a {{case will}} stretch depends upon load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the typical}} [...] "direct print" [...] method, the plate is inked, the thin paper (dampened) {{is placed on}} the inked plate and <b>trimmed</b> to <b>size,</b> paste is applied to the thin paper, and the {{ensemble}} (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet. This is then run through a printing press. In the pressure of the press, the ink is transferred to the thin paper, and the thinner paper is simultaneously adhered to the backing paper. An advantage of this method is that the thin paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is <b>trimmed</b> to <b>size</b> and then quickly affixed in place.|$|R

500|$|The {{magazine}} is oversized {{to be as}} large as would fit within the fold of The Wall Street Journal.

The initial cover featured Diana Dondoe in a dress fabricated from The Wall Street Journal newsprint design, which the New York Observer feels is a tip of the hat to a controversy noted in the New York Times about a poverty chic photo spread in the India edition of the August 2008 Vogue.|$|R
50|$|Quill & Quire was {{substantially}} redesigned in 2006 in {{an effort}} led by publisher Alison Jones, editor Derek Weiler and art director Gary Campbell. One of the chief aims of the redesign was to demonstrate to the book and magazine industries the viability of printing on 100% recycled, environmentally-friendly paper stock. (It {{was one of the}} first magazines in Canada to do so.) As part of the process, the magazines <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> was reduced for the first time in 30 years, from a large tabloid newspaper size (11” x 14”) to that of a standard magazine. This also marked the first time the magazine was printed entirely in colour. The debut redesign issue (January 2006) featured author and artist Douglas Coupland on the cover.|$|R
5000|$|Cultural {{anthropologist}} Matt Thorn praised Stu Levy {{for opening}} up an untapped market for cartoons {{with the publication}} of Sailor Moon. Before Sailor Moon, the belief among entertainment executives was that [...] "girls don't watch cartoons." [...] Due to Sailor Moon’s immense popularity, Tokyopop discontinued the serial from its magazines, and released it separately as its first manga graphic novel. They engineered prominent book distribution via retail stores, standardized book <b>trim</b> <b>size,</b> created a basic industry-wide rating system, and developed the first-ever retail manga displays and introduced the world of graphic novels to an audience of teenage girls. Also, together with Diamond, Tokyopop offered retailers free spinner rack displays for Tokyopop manga, thereby increasing the visibility of the medium in bookstores.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of pages in desktop publishing, {{electronic}} pages and virtual paper pages to be printed on physical paper pages. All computerized documents are technically electronic, which are limited in size only by computer memory or computer data storage space. Virtual paper pages will ultimately be printed, and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with international standard physical paper sizes such as [...] "A4, [...] " [...] "letter, [...] " [...] etc., if not custom <b>sizes</b> for <b>trimming.</b> Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in posters, billboards and trade show displays. A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in WYSIWYG format. Each page for printing has <b>trim</b> <b>sizes</b> (edge of paper) and a printable area if bleed printing is not possible {{as is the case with}} most desktop printers. A web page is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the content to scale in size with the page or causing the content to re-flow.|$|R
