5|$|Acetic acid is a {{chemical}} reagent for <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> chemical compounds. The largest single use of acetic acid is in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> vinyl acetate monomer, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production.

5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> ferro{{manganese}}, the {{manganese ore}} {{is mixed with}} iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{palatial}} {{control over}} resources {{appears to have}} been highly selective in spatial terms and in terms of how different industries were managed. Thus, sectors like <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> perfumed oil and bronze materials were directly monitored from the palace, but <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> ceramics was only indirectly monitored. Regional transactions between the palaces are also recorded on a few occasions.|$|E

5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas.
