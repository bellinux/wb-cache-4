5|$|The Poitevin had {{a slight}} {{increase}} in popularity {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, and could count approximately 100 farms perpetuating the breed. The association had around 300 members, as well as 83 stallions and 189 mares registered. However, by 2006, the Poitevin was still considered the most endangered French horse breed, with less than 100 births per year and a slightly decreasing population. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> crossbreeding done with outside breeds, in order to maintain the numbers of purebred stock. In 2008, a second genetic study was conducted in partnership with the Institut national de la recherche agronomique; this study considered the Poitevin and four other French breeds to be endangered. It suggested making these breeds a conservation priority in order to maintain maximum genetic diversity among the French horse population.|$|E

25|$|Unwashed silk chiffon may shrink up to 8% {{due to a}} {{relaxation}} of the fiber macrostructure, so silk should either be washed prior to garment construction, or dry cleaned.

25|$|A common {{example of}} a {{population}} bottleneck is the Northern elephant seal.

They have made a full recovery, with the total number of individuals at around 100,000 and growing. The effects of the bottleneck are visible, however.

25|$|Some of {{the soils}} are geochemically very unusual. They are {{extremely}} weathered tropical soils, {{with high levels}} of iron and aluminium oxides (oxisol) and mercury, and they contain high levels of natural radioactivity. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> uranium, but the radionucleides Th-230 and Pa-231 head the decay chains. This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds, but the geochemical evidence suggests that the origin of these elements is extreme weathering of coral and brief sea submergence 120,000 years ago. Endothermal upwelling, by which mild volcanic heat draws deep seawater up through the porous coral, may also contribute.|$|E
25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> monetary incentive {{for them to}} install power factor correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power {{as measured by the}} meter can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> {{information}} on Domínguez’s public {{activity in the}} first decade of the 20th century; he was probably active in Juventud Jaimista and Juventud Hispanoamericana. In 1909 he published his first work, a booklet dedicated to medieval rulers of Navarre, followed by articles in scholarly reviews focusing on history of the province and short biographical studies, also anchored in history of Navarre. Domínguez also tried his hand in Pamplona dailies as a literary critic. Some authors claim that his first public assignment was mayorship of Villafranca, but when first running for seat in the Cortes, he was referred to by the press only as “joven abogado y escritor”.|$|E

25|$|Although {{much of the}} Nabonidus Chronicle is fragmentary, {{the section}} {{relating}} to {{the last year of}} Nabonidus's reign – 539 BC – is mostly intact. It provides very little information about Cyrus's activities in the years immediately preceding the battle. The chronicler focuses on events of immediate relevance to Babylonia and its rulers, only occasionally records events outside Babylonia and does not provide much detail other than a bare outline of key incidents. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> information for the period 547-539.

25|$|Yaroslav had one {{son from}} the first {{marriage}} (his Christian name being Ilya (?-1020)), and six sons from the second marriage. Apprehending the danger that could ensue from divisions between brothers, he exhorted them {{to live in peace}} with each other. The eldest of these, Vladimir of Novgorod, best remembered for building the Cathedral of St. Sophia, Novgorod, predeceased his father. Three other sons—Iziaslav I, Sviatoslav II, and Vsevolod I—reigned in Kiev one after another. The youngest children of Yaroslav were Igor Yaroslavich (1036–1060) of Volhynia and Vyacheslav Yaroslavich (1036–1057) of the Principality of Smolensk. About Vyacheslav, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> information. Some documents point out the fact of him having a son, Boris Vyacheslavich, who challenged Vsevolod I sometime in 1077-1078.|$|E
25|$|After {{inauguration of}} the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) found itself to have {{accumulated}} an uncomfortable {{amount of debt}} – almost {{one third of the}} annual state budget of Ethiopia – resulting in difficulties to pay back loans. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> option to provide additional funding for much-needed dry ports, storage facilities, trunk lines and access roads to have the railway integration in place to generate much-needed revenues to balance the debt. Nevertheless, mandatory trunk lines are now being built, such as the new Dire Dawa Dry Port, which alone took 12 months to negotiate and which costs per km of rails roughly 10 times that of the main Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway – Ethiopian authorities consider the costs being very high.|$|E
