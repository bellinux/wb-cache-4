Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of antenna, gain takes into account the losses that always occur in the real world. Specifically, accelerating charge (<b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>current)</b> causes electromagnetic radiation per Maxwell's equations. Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on radiating elements to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna. This coupling is never 100% efficient (by Laws of Thermodynamics), and therefore antenna gain will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.|$|E

5000|$|The power {{distribution}} network distributes power and ground voltages from pad locations to all devices in a design. Shrinking device dimensions, faster switching frequencies and increasing power consumption in deep sub-micrometer technologies cause large switching currents to {{flow in the}} power and ground networks which degrade performance and reliability. A robust {{power distribution}} network is essential to ensure reliable operation of circuits on a chip. Power supply integrity verification is a critical concern in high-performance designs. Due to {{the resistance of the}} interconnects constituting the network, there is a voltage drop across the network, commonly referred to as the IR-drop. The package supplies currents to the pads of the power grid either by means of package leads in wire-bond chips or through C4 bump arrays in flip chip technology. Although the resistance of package is quite small, the inductance of package leads is significant which causes a voltage drop at the pad locations due to the <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>current</b> drawn by the devices on die.

Hazardous area electrical systems are distinguished from more typical applications of spark modelling by their low voltages and currents.

The use of a classical parametrised empirical model is proposed, and justified with a qualitative treatment of the underlying physics. Parameter values for the model are calculated by studying sparks with constant length and constant current respectively, and then combining the observed trends into the proposed model. The model, is then validated against experimental data obtained from sparks with <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>current</b> and length. The relevance of dynamics arising from energy storage in the arc column is also considered, identifying the situations where a quasi-static approach is sufficient.

The VLF antenna is driven at 10 Amps with a frequency (ω_VLF) greater than the lower hybrid frequency (ω_LH), while the ELF antenna is driven at 3 Amps with a frequency (ω_ELF) less than ω_LH. The combined ELF/VLF antenna (which we call a parametric antenna) includes both antennas driven simultaneously in the same simulation domain. We show that the parametric antenna non-linearly excites electromagnetic (EM) Whistler waves {{to a greater extent than}} the VLF antenna alone.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{behavior}} of a metal vapor plasma arc in a vacuum arc remelting (VAR) furnace is believed {{to contribute to the}} formation of defects in reactive metal and super-alloy ingots. Industry standard instrumentation, which includes electric current and voltage measurements, can asses the stability of an arc but cannot predict the location of an arc. It is known that Maxwell’s equations predict a magnetic flux density at a distance from an arc. It is shown that a single arc’s location can be uniquely determined in a cross section by using an externally mounted 2 -axis Hall Effect magnetic flux density sensor provided that the system’s electric current is also measured and the geometry of the VAR furnace is known. The solution is based on the Biot-Savart Law with finite element modeling assisting the analysis. The methodology is validated using controlled, static experiments. The measurement system is deployed on a small scale, experimental VAR furnace to investigate arc behavior. Results from VAR operation show a time averaged arc distribution that does not significantly change {{over the course of a}} melt. By comparing the results from multiple sensors, observed arc motions are categorized as being either retrograde or sympathetic. The former is characterized by large periodic motions, and the latter either small random motions or motions associated with an event such as a liquid metal drip short. Significant alternating currents are found to exist in the DC VAR furnace. A magnetostatic single arc model is not sufficient to describe the current distribution in the VAR furnace at an instant but it may be an effective means to detect quasi static non-axisymmetry or slow <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>current</b> profile changes during VAR operation...|$|E

40|$|The <b>time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>currents</b> in the Ohmic {{transformer}} in the SST- 1 tokamak induce voltages {{that drive}} large eddy currents in the passive structures like the vacuum vessel and cryostat. Since the vacuum vessel and the cryostat are toroidally continuous without electrical breaks in SST- 1, {{this leads to}} a shielding effect on the flux penetrating the vacuum vessel. This reduces the magnitude of the loop voltage seen by the plasma as also delays its buildup. Also the induced currents alter the null location of magnetic field. This will have serious implications on the plasma breakdown and startup and corrective measures may be required in case of an insufficient loop voltage or an improper null. Further, the eddy currents distribution will be vital for the plasma equilibrium and need to be considered while reconstructing the equilibrium. Evolution of the toroidal eddy currents in SST- 1 passive structures has been studied using a toroidal-filament model.

Part 2 continues the discussion, presenting an analysis of coupling mechanism between antenna and transponder with respect to their orientation and relative movement. Magnetic Flux through Transponder One possible way to overcome multi-interval interaction of an antenna-transponder and improve antenna performance is to use a finite conductive element (or elements grouped together) for the magnetic flux generation.

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>varying</b> <b>currents</b> within winding {{and core}} {{conductors}} induce magnetic fields. When {{more than one}} conductor is present the resultant magnetic field can be found by adding the individual magnetic fields by superposition. The resultant magnetic field in turn induces eddy currents within each electrical component within {{the vicinity of the}} resultant magnetic field. Eddy currents flow in the opposite direction of the primary current and increase the resistance by reducing the area in which the primary current has to travel. Eddy currents also reduce the effectiveness of the conductors to conductor high frequency currents. Skin and proximity effects were numerically investigated for two parallel plate conductors while a laminated core was designed to reduce the power losses. Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations were solved to obtain analytical equations for magnetic fields eddy current distribution and power losses. These equations were illustrated in MATLAB for various frequencies to validate the theoretical analysis. Results demonstrate current within an isolated conductor flows near the surface. However, when the same conductor is placed near another conductor the flow path is affected. For the case when the current is flowing in the opposite direction the magnetic fields are added in the area between the conductors and subtracted on the outer side of the conductor. This causes an increase of the current density within the conductor areas, where the conductors are close to each other. This is the proximity effect. The anti-proximity effect occurs when two conductors carry current in same direction. In this case the magnetic fields are subtracted from each other in the area between the conductors and are added {{to each other in the}} area outside the conductors resulting in a higher current density in these areas. The eddy currents can be reduced in two ways. Using a highly resistant material for the core increases the skin depth making the distribution of the magnetic flux more uniform. Laminating the core with an oxide film can be used to reduce the eddy current loss as well. The study shows that the eddy current power loss in a sold core is greater than loss in a laminated core by a factor of K 2, where K is the number of the sheets in the laminated core...|$|R
