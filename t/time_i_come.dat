500|$|Alberto Contador had {{on various}} {{previous}} occasions {{announced that the}} 2016 {{would be his last}} as a professional racer. After his victory in the Tour of the Basque Country, however, he said [...] "I'm sure this isn't the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> here" [...] and said that he would probably continue beyond the 2016 season. It was his first general classification victory since the 2015 Route du Sud; he dedicated the victory to his fans and to Oleg Tinkov, the owner of the Tinkoff team. Sergio Henao said that he had tried a different tactic in the time trial – holding back early on in order to give more effort later in the stage – and said that he was pleased both with his own performance and with how his team had ridden. He said that he was feeling strong ahead of his main objectives for the season, the Ardennes classics. Quintana said that his bike change in the time trial had helped, but that it was not quite enough to win the stage. He said that he was pleased with how he had ridden the race and in particular with how he had recovered from illness earlier in the week.|$|E

2500|$|This tragedy {{stayed with}} my family {{for a very long}} <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> from a long {{heritage}} of very hard working, blue collar, Italian-Americans. My family came over from Italy, through Ellis Island... wrote this song not only in [...] honor, but in the honor of so many people who've lost ones that they love or maybe their pending loss. So terrifying. You just never want to say goodbye.|$|E

2500|$|... "The next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to this place, I'm {{going to}} get police {{protection}} or put my wagon on stilts. I got rid of everything, all right, but I didn't really sell a turnip. You see, those society women stormed my wagon, crawled over the wheels and crowded me off to respectable distance, say [...] When I got back the wagon was swept as clean as a good housewife's parlor, and there in a bushel basket was a quart of silver." ...|$|E

Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back after being {{away from home for}} a night she won't let me {{be in the same room}} with her if she can help it. Stasz writes that these were [...] "code words for [...] fear that [...] was consorting with prostitutes and might bring home venereal disease." ...|$|E

After meeting Iraqi Defence Minister Abdul-Qader Mohammed Jassim al-Mifarji, UK Defence Minister Des Browne said Iraq was moving forward.

2500|$|The phrase [...] "took me to a Leafs game" [...] {{was used}} as a {{euphemism}} for an attempted male-on-male sexual encounter. The gag originated in a sketch in which Scott Thompson played a homophobic man who took offense at another man's (McKinney) attempt to seduce him by taking him to a Maple Leafs game: [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to this city, some guy picks me up at the bus station, takes me to a Leaf game, gets me pissed, then tries to blow me.

Krishna Guthrie has been attending the festival since he was ten or twelve years old and says, “Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> here it's like a history lesson.” A familial theme seemed to carry through the festival with Butch Hancock being joined on stage by his 13-year-old son, Rory, and Kevin Welch performing in tandem with his son, Dustin.|$|E
2500|$|After their finals defeat, Qureshi {{spoke to}} the crowd to [...] "say {{something}} {{on behalf of all}} Pakistanis, [...] every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> here, there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys." [...] He then made a political appeal to the controversial [...] "Ground Zero mosque" [...] saying [...] "For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world - freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. I would really appreciate it." [...] Indian and Pakistani fans filled the stadium for the final as the two U.N. ambassadors again sat together in the President's Box. Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said [...] "They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That they {{certainly}} are not, Miss Mitford," [...] the mate laughed. [...] "I saw some of them the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> through here, and hideous-looking creatures they are, and wear no clothes to speak of." ...|$|R

2500|$|Keith Uhlich from Slant Magazine was {{positive}} to both season {{one and three}} of Millennium, giving them both {{four out of five}} stars and calling season one: [...] "We are racing toward an apocalypse of our own creation. This is who we are." [...] Mike Drucker from IGN called the second season a combination of the [...] "X-Files and the violent paranoia of Se7en." [...] Variety reviewer Jeremy Gerard compared the show to Twin Peaks and was overall positive to the series, but said [...] "I just wish it were a little more fun, that I didn't have this nagging feeling that it wants to hurt me the next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> around." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B and said it had [...] "great visuals and a commanding performance by Henriksen." [...] Justine Elias from The New York Times was mostly positive to the series and said [...] "If The X-Files, with its offbeat humor and conspiracy theories, wonders about those things that go bump in the night, Millennium explores the darkness – and embraces it." [...] Daily Nebraskan said in their review that the show had [...] "a lot of potential: a good lead actor, a solid premise and a feel that will keep audiences glued to their televisions." ...|$|E
