5|$|In 1971, the Miami Urban Area Transportation Study {{completed}} by the Dade County metropolitan planning organization recommended the construction for a rapid transit system for Greater Miami. Having experienced a prolonged post-World War II population boom, metropolitan Dade County's permanent population rose by 35% to nearly 1.3 million residents within a decade, among the fastest population growth rates in the United States. Within a year of the study, county residents approved a $132.5 million ($ million, adjusted for current inflation) bond dedicated to transit, with additional funding approved by the Florida Legislature for transit which, up until that time, operated solely on fare revenue. In 1976, with preliminary engineering completed for the system, the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> (FTA, then, the Urban Mass <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration)</b> committed 80% of the costs for {{the first stage of}} rapid transit system, with the county and state incurring the remaining cost. In the end the system cost over a billion dollars.|$|E
5|$|Several {{collisions}} {{have occurred}} on Washington Metro, resulting in injuries and fatalities, along with numerous derailments with {{few or no}} injuries.

5|$|In 1998, the {{historic}} {{status of the}} barges was {{a concern for the}} Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7, the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> and/or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum.|$|E

5000|$|The Cycle Center {{has helped}} Chicago to {{become known as}} a cycling-friendly city. According to an article in The Washington Post based on {{selections}} by the Adventure Cycling Association and Bicycling magazine, Chicago {{is one of the}} ten most cycling-friendly cities in the U.S. because of the Cycle Center and the Chicago Department of Transportations Bicycle Program. [...] The Cycle Center was featured in the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administrations</b> April 2009 report to the United States Congress on a new generation of innovative transit systems entitled Reinventing Transit: American communities finding smarter, cleaner, faster transportation solutions.

5|$|Originally budgeted at $400million, the new South Ferry station cost a {{total of}} $530million, {{with most of the}} money being a grant from the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> {{earmarked}} for World Trade Center reconstruction. In January 2009, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far {{from the edge of the}} platform. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009, with a new free transfer to between the 1 and the N, R, and W trains at the older Whitehall Street station. It was the first new subway station completed since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council {{rejected}} a {{memorandum of agreement}} with Sound Transit that would have expedited processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials in other cities. Despite fears that Tukwila's decision would jeopardize federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> (FTA) later that month. The city council approved expedited permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity at the future South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an additional cost of $5 million.|$|E
5|$|Much {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the role of human error in the collision; once the engineer had forgotten (or missed) the approach signal there was no automatic system to prevent the collision. The NTSB noted that had a positive train control system been in place on the Metropolitan Subdivision the collision would have been less likely: the system would have detected MARC #286's unauthorized speed and stopped the train. The NTSB also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part of capacity improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision. The NTSB argued that having this signal after Kensington would have reduced the likelihood of the sort of human error which caused the crash, and in the NTSB's view CSX and the FTA did not properly assess the effects of removing the signal.|$|E

5|$|A {{commuter}} rail station in Mukilteo {{had been part}} of the original Sound Transit proposal rejected in 1995 and adopted the following year, as part of a Seattle–Everett line on the existing BNSF corridor. The agency selected the station site in 1999, choosing a platform east of State Route 525 and the Washington State Ferries terminal over one at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park because of concerns arising from existing parking and traffic issues in the area. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2007 for the initial phase of the project, the northern side platform, as part of a multimodal transit hub built in conjunction with a new Mukilteo ferry terminal. The $19.2 million project, including preparations for a second phase to open in 2009, was funded by Sound Transit with a grant from the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration.</b> Sounder service from Mukilteo Station began on May 31, 2008, with a special weekend round-trip run to a Seattle Mariners game. The project was praised by local politicians for its multi-agency cooperation, especially between Sound Transit and Washington State Ferries.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2001, the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> {{approved}} {{the start of}} preliminary engineering on a full-length Second Avenue Subway. The MTA's final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was approved in April 2004; this latest proposal is for a two-track line from 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem, down Second Avenue to Hanover Square in the Financial District. The final plan called for the full-length Second Avenue line to carry two services: the T, with a route emblem colored , {{as well as a}} rerouted Q train. Phase 1 rerouted the Q, the Broadway Express via the BMT 63rd Street Line and north along Second Avenue, to the Upper East Side at 96th Street. Phase 2 will extend the rerouted Q train to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. In Phase Three, the new T train will run from 125th Street to Houston Street. The final phase will extend T train service from Houston Street to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs only. Beginning in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms {{would not have been}} possible because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause operational difficulties with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight passing track like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 million in federal stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and Alewife. The work was then intended to be finished by the end of 2010.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Entrance 2's {{escalator}} entrance was to {{be located}} inside the Yorkshire Towers apartment building at 305 East 86th Street, on {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 86th Street. In 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal <b>Transit</b> <b>Administration</b> (FTA) found this to be unfeasible, so the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) revised the plan to two separate sidewalk entrances in front of the building. During the planning process, it was determined that building a new entrance within the Yorkshire Towers would be too expensive and logistically unfeasible. The apartments directly above the entrance's location would have had to be structurally underpinned during construction, and the Food Emporium supermarket location would have had to close {{to make way for the}} new entrance. Of the three alternatives presented for moving the entrance, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be two new escalator entrances on the north side of 86th Street, both flanking the semicircular driveway of Yorkshire Towers and facing away from the driveway. There was also a proposal to move the sidewalk escalator entrances to the south side of the street, as well as another proposal to build a new structure containing five elevators at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 86th Street, in a manner similar to Entrance 3 of the adjacent 72nd Street station.|$|E

40|$|Background—Carcinoid {{diarrhoea}} {{is associated}} with rapid small bowel and proximal colonic <b>transit.</b> Intravenous <b>administration</b> of a serotonin type 3 receptor (5 HT 3) antagonist restores postprandial colonic tone towards normal in carcinoid patients.  Aims—To evaluate the medium term effects of an oral 5 HT 3 antagonist, alosetron, on symptoms, stool fat, and transit in patients with carcinoid diarrhoea.  Methods—In 27 patients with carcinoid diarrhoea, symptoms were recorded daily and gastrointestinal transit was measured by scintigraphy in a three dose (0. 1, 0. 5, 2. 0 mg, twice daily), randomised (1 : 1 : 1), parallel group, four week study. Placebo was given during the first week. Loperamide (2 mg capsules) was used as rescue medication.  Results—There were numerical improvements in median diarrhoea score, stool weight, loperamide use, and overall colonic transit at four hours, but no overall significant drug effect was shown. Alosetron reduced the proximal colon emptying rate (p< 0. 05 in 20 evaluable comparisons), but did not significantly alter small bowel transit.  Conclusions—Alosetron retardation of proximal colonic emptying in patients with carcinoid diarrhoea confirms the potential role of a 5 HT 3 mechanism in this disorder. Doses of alosetron higher than 2. 0 mg twice daily will be required for symptomatic benefit in carcinoid diarrhoea. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{selective}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) type 3 receptor antagonist, ramosetron, inhibits stress-induced abnormal defecation {{in animals}} {{and is currently}} used as a therapeutic drug for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of ramosetron on altered gastrointestinal (GI) transit. Methods Male guinea pigs weighing approximately 300 g were used. The effect of ramosetron was investigated on altered GI transit induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), 5 -HT, or mustard oil (MO). GI transit was evaluated by the migration of char-coal mixture from the pylorus to the most distal point, and expressed as a percentage (%) of charcoal migration (cm) of the total length of total small intestine (cm). Results The average charcoal transit was 51. 3 ± 20. 1 % in the control (vehicle) group, whereas in the ramosetron group charcoal moved 56. 6 ± 21. 9 %, 46. 9 ± 9. 14 % and 8. 4 ± 5. 6 % of the total small intestine at the concentrations of 10, 30 and 100 μg/kg, respectively. GI <b>transit</b> after <b>administration</b> of TRH (100 μg/kg), 5 -HT (10 mg/kg) or MO (10 mg/kg) was accelerated compared to vehicle (5 -HT, 94. 9 ± 9. 22 %; TRH, 73. 4 ± 14. 7 %; MO, 81. 0 ± 13. 7 %). Ramosetron inhibited GI transit altered by 5 -HT, TRH or MO...|$|R

As parts of the works for the Forum, the Governor ordered {{an expansion of the}} metropolitan subway system, the remodeling of the city's main square, numerous infrastructure works, and other investments. The cost of these was financed by creating new debt mechanisms. Among them, the <b>Transit</b> Control <b>Administration</b> (Instituto de Control Vehicular), in charge of licensing plates and licensing drivers in the State, was made autonomous so that its income could be given as an insurance to bonds. The Monterrey - Cadereyta toll highway was turned into the [...] "Nuevo León State Highway Network" [...] (Red Estatal de Carreteras) so that its income and its assets be used to back more bonds. The State Government has argued, however, that the liabilities of decentralized organisms cannot be considered debt, and therefore the State's debt has been reduced. This argument is done despite the fact the decentralized organisms that have assumed debt where decentralized during this administration, and the opposition has accused the government of descentralizing with the sole purpose of acquiring debt. In fact, the issue sparked a controversy that had to be resolved by Mexico's Supreme Court. The financing through debt incurred by the State has risen so much that Nuevo León, the third richest state in the country, became the 4th most leveraged State in Mexico.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine whether a-blockers affect epididymal sperm parameters and testicular spermatogenesis. Sprague-Dawley rats were given orally a I mg/kg body weight dose of Bunazosin, a selective a-adrenoreceptor antagonist, daily for one month as a short-term administration group and three months as a long-term administration group. Using a micropuncture technique, epididymal sperm concentration and sperm motility were measured. Epididymal sperm concentrations were significantly increased in the Bunazosin group, but progressive motility of spermatozoa were not altered. Daily testicular sperm production was also increased after administration of Bunazosin. There were no differences in epididymal sperm concentration and daily sperm production between the one-month group and three-month group. An epididymal wide storage capacity and short <b>transit</b> time after <b>administration</b> of the a-blocker could increase the sperm concentration in the cauda epididymidis. Because {{there were no differences}} in the epididymal sperm parameters and daily testicular sperm production between the two groups, these changes may occur at 1 month after administration of the a-blocker.
