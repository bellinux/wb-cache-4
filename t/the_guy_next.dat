2500|$|Robert Graettinger's [...] "Thermopylae" [...] (from the City of Glass CD) is {{the first}} Graettinger work {{recorded}} by the Kenton Orchestra (December 1947); the title referring to the famous Battle of Thermopylae fought in 480 BC between the Greeks and Persians. [...] Venudor's and Cox's comparison to Alexander Mosolov's Iron Foundry is not too far off but Thermopylae can better be compared to Italian Futurism music as well as larger more involved movements of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's suites of the time (George Antheil's music would be another). Graettinger's treatment of the sax section juxtaposed against the straight 8th note pulse with Weidler's muscular 'Hodgesesque' lead alto playing places the work firmly in the camp of Ellington's 'Jungle Music,' the influence of Benny Carter's playing and writing is clearly evident also. Graettinger's intention is far closer to jazz than to the modernism of Russians or any classical music of the time; this makes it no less innovative but merely assigns the lineage to a more accurate place. Second alto saxophonist/clarinetist Art Pepper sums up the comparison to Ellington this way, [...] "...Graettinger didn't just write for a band, or for sections; he wrote for each individual person, more or less as Ellington did. It was so difficult to play because you were independent of <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>next</b> to you." ...|$|E

3000|$|It is {{plausible}} that the mixed opinions of decentralized sources derive from different perspectives regarding {{the safety of}} consuming groundwater, and the potential effectiveness of home water treatment techniques. The paper survey results indicated that groundwater accessed from wells using buckets was more frequently used for nonpotable purposes than for drinking. In 90 % of the interviews, participants explicitly stated that the local groundwater is not safe to drink, and only one participant believed that shallow groundwater was safe to consume. An excerpt from {{an interview with a}} Leogane resident stated that well water “was mainly used for washing clothes or baths, cleaning and stuff like that. The only thing is we don’t drink it.” Another stated that “people do their best to use clean water for cooking. Not so much the well.

5000|$|The film's visual {{style was}} {{strongly}} based upon that of Mike Mignola, {{the comic book}} artist behind Hellboy.
