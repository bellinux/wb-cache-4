50|$|Cellulose acetate {{phthalate}} (CAP), {{also known}} as cellacefate and cellulosi acetas phthalas, is a commonly used polymer phthalate {{in the formulation of}} pharmaceuticals, such as the enteric coating of tablets or capsules and for controlled release formulations. It is a cellulose polymer where about half of the hydroxyls are esterified with acetyls, a quarter are esterified with one or two carboxyls of a phthalic acid, and the remainder are unchanged. Its CAS number is 9004-38-0. It is a hygroscopic white to off-white free-flowing powder, granules, or flakes. It is tasteless and odorless, though may have a weak odor of acetic acid. Its main use in pharmaceutics is with enteric formulations. It can be used together with other coating agents, e.g. ethyl cellulose. Cellulose acetate phthalate is commonly plasticized with diethyl phthalate, a hydrophobic compound, or <b>triethyl</b> <b>citrate,</b> a hydrophilic compound; other compatible plasticizers are various phthalates, triacetin, dibutyl tartrate, glycerol, propylene glycol, tripropionin, triacetin citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, etc.|$|E

In this study, the EC filters employed an alternative plasticiser, tri-ethyl citrate (1, 2, 3 -triethyl 2 -hydroxypropane- 1, 2, 3 -tricarboxylate), at approximately 16 % w/w. Filters containing <b>triethyl</b> <b>citrate</b> demonstrate a greater reduction of phenols in mainstream smoke as compared with those containing triacetin (McAdam et al. 2012).

Three types of cigarette filter rods, namely, triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate (TEC-CA) filter rods, triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate-paper (TEC-CA-paper) dual filter rods and cellulose acetate-paper-triethyl citrate (CA-paper-TEC) dual filter rods, were manufactured. In order to promote the curing of CA rods, high-frequency radiation was introduced into the procedure of filter manufacture.

All tested carriers were plasticized with 30 % of <b>triethyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (TEC).

In the experimental part adhesivity of plasticized oligoesters was measured. Hydrated mucin isolated from porcine stomach {{was used as a}} model substrate for bioadhesion. The rate of adhesivity is the maximal force Fmax [N], which is required for the detachment of tested samples from the substrate. This force was related {{to the size of the}} contact surface and expressed in units mN/mm 2. The highest adhesivity was measured in oligoesters labelled 5 D and 8 D, which had low dynamic viscosity.

Kollicoat SR 30 D premixed with a selected plasticizer (10 % wt/wt propylene glycol, 2. 5 % <b>triethyl</b> <b>citrate,</b> or 2. 5 % dibutyl sebacute), talc, and red # 30 lake dye was coated onto the drug beads in an Aeromatic Strea I fluid-bed drier with a Wurster insert using bottom spray. With propylene glycol as the plasticizer, increases in polymer coating level retarded drug release from beads in a stepwise fashion along with apparent permeability, indicating a consistent release mechanisms. Stability studies at 40 °C/ 75 % RH revealed gradual decreases in dissolution rate, and additional curing studies further confirmed the dependence of release kinetics on curing condition. Furthermore, the type of plasticizer was found to play a key role. Unplasticized formulations exhibited the fastest dissolution, followed by formulations plasticized with <b>triethyl</b> <b>citrate,</b> propylene glycol, and dibutyl sebacate. All 4 formulations (unplasticized and plasticized), nevertheless, revealed a marked difference between uncured and cured dissolution profiles. Kollicoat SR 30 D has, thereby, been demonstrated to effectively retard drug release from nonpareilbased systems. However, selected plasticizer type and subsequent curing condition play important roles in controlling drug release from such a system...|$|E

To avoid this issue, use of citrus fruit waste {{for the production of}} citric acid (CA) is one of viable mean to obtain value added chemicals. Moreover, synthesis of <b>triethyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (TEC), a non-toxic plasticizer by esterification of CA with ethanol over heterogeneous catalyst would be renewable and sustainable catalytic process. In this context, parent Ultrastable Y (USY) and different percentage phosphonated USY (P-USY) zeolites were used for the synthesis of TEC in a closed batch reactor, for the first time. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by N 2 -adsorption desorption isotherm, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and NH 3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD. Effect of reaction conditions, such as the molar ratio of ethanol to CA (5 : 1 - 20 : 1), the catalyst to CA ratio (0. 05 - 0. 25) and reaction temperature (363 - 403 K), were studied in view to maximizing CA conversion and TEC yield. Phosphonated USY catalysts were found to be superior in activity (CA conversion and TEC yield) than parent USY, which is attributed to the increased in total acidity with phosphonation. Among the studied catalysts, the P 2 USY (2 % phosphorous loaded on USY) was found to be an optimum catalyst with 99 % CA conversion and 82 % TEC yield, which is higher than the reported values. This study opens new avenues of research demonstrating principles of green chemistry such as easy separable and reusable catalyst, non-toxic product, bio-renewable synthetic route, milder operating parameters and waste minimization.
