5000|$|When Garner was {{replaced}} {{in his role}} by Paul Bremer on May 11, 2003, {{there was quite a}} bit of speculation as to why he {{was replaced}} so abruptly. It has been suggested that Garner was moved aside because he did not agree with the White House about who should decide how to reconstruct Iraq. He wanted early elections—90 days after the fall of Baghdad—and the new government to decide how to run the country and what to do with its assets. Garner said [...] "I don't think Iraqis need to go by the U.S. plan, I <b>think</b> that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to do is set an Iraqi government that represents the freely elected will of the people.

40|$|The {{presentation}} program PowerPoint {{is probably}} the most used tool in the schools, high schools and universities of today. The use of this program, however, comes at a cost, because {{it is not just a}} different and neutral way of teaching. Like the use of any technology, PowerPoint affects not only the way we present and teach, but also the way we think, learn and understand. The program carries an inherent tendency to crate fragmentation of thought and cognitive overload. In order to avoid this we should stop thinking in terms of technology and begin to <b>think</b> rhetorically. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> is media rhetoracy: the ability to communicate persuasively and appropriately. “Bullet me, bullet me, I take the full responsibility” (The September When, 1991) In the town of Alexandria, in the state of Virginia in the USA, there lived a woman we can call Sarah Wyndham.

"At {{the start}} of this {{sensible}} book about the [...] "weight and fitness crisis" [...] in America, Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett says the answer lies in the study of evolution. As animals, we are genetically almost identical to our Stone Age ancestors. We live in advanced societies, with supermarkets and cars and lifts, but we are built to be hunter-gatherers. We are programmed to seek out fat, sugar, starch and salt, because, in the Stone Age, these things were hard to come by. When they turn up in abundance, our bodies, for the most part, can't say no[...] [...] [...] to put it simply, human beings are evolving much more slowly than the food we eat. And the food is tricking us. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> it's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need,</b> but it's just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want. <b>What</b> can <b>we</b> do? Eat sensibly and exercise, of course.

50|$|After {{the success}} of Strictly Ballroom, Luhrmann took some time over {{deciding}} what his next project would be:Our philosophy {{has always been that}} <b>we</b> <b>think</b> up <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> in our life, choose something creative that will make that life fulfilling, and then follow that road. With Romeo and Juliet what I {{wanted to do was to}} look at the way in which Shakespeare might make a movie of one of his plays if he was a director. How would he make it? We don't know a lot about Shakespeare, but we do know he would make a 'movie' movie. He was a player. We know about the Elizabethan stage and that he was playing for 3000 drunken punters, from the street sweeper to the Queen of England - and his competition was bear-baiting and prostitution. So he was a relentless entertainer and a user of incredible devices and theatrical tricks to ultimately create something of meaning and convey a story. That was <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do.Luhrmann obtained some funds from Fox to do a workshop and shoot some teaser footage in Sydney. Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to pay his own expenses to fly to Sydney and be part of it. Once Fox saw footage of the fight scene, they agreed to support it.|$|R
