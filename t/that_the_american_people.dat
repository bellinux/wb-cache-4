5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
25|$|It's too {{bad that}} {{they are trying to}} buy America. And it's time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> spoke out against this terrible {{dishonesty}} of these two brothers, who are about as un-American as anyone that I can imagine.|$|E

This revelation prompted an online attack ad against Durbin by the National Republican Senatorial Committee.|$|E

5000|$|On 24 April 2009, President Barack Obama {{called for}} an end to the FFEL program, calling it a {{wasteful}} and inefficient system of [...] "taxpayers...paying banks a premium to act as middlemen—a premium <b>that</b> costs <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> billions of dollars each year....a premium we cannot afford." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{election}} of Donald Trump (2017) has {{coincided with the}} country's attempt at globalization with increasing pipeline exports and LNG shipments.>. He also has plans to revive the fossil fuel industry with his America First Energy Plan. In respect to natural gas, this plan will attempt to “take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> own.” However, even though Trump plans on opening some of these lands closed to drilling, analysts believe that this would not only be difficult with all the regulation but also would not increase revenue as much Trump believes it would. Trump also plans on eliminating Obama's Climate Action Plan and all its regulations.|$|E
500|$|Following Nixon's {{landslide}} {{defeat of}} McGovern, Meany said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> had [...] "overwhelmingly repudiated neo-isolationism" [...] in foreign policy.

500|$|On August 7, Obama {{signed the}} VA funding and reform {{legislation}} {{in a ceremony}} at Fort Belvoir, an Army installation in the State of Virginia. [...] "This bill covers a lot of ground, from expanding survivor benefits and educational opportunities, to improving care for veterans struggling with traumatic brain injury and for victims of sexual assault," [...] said Obama, and gives the VA Secretary [...] "more authority to hold people accountable... {{so that he can}} move quickly to remove senior executives who fail to meet the standards of conduct and competence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> demand." ...|$|E

500|$|Nixon {{took the}} high road in the campaign, but still wanted McGovern {{attacked}} for his positions, and the task fell in part to Agnew. The vice president told the press he was anxious to discard the image he had earned as a partisan campaigner in 1968 and 1970, {{and wanted to be}} perceived as conciliatory. He defended Nixon on Watergate, and when McGovern alleged that the Nixon administration was the most corrupt in history, made a speech in South Dakota, describing McGovern as a [...] "desperate candidate who can't seem to understand <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> don't want a philosophy of defeat and self-hate put upon them".|$|E
500|$|On 10 August 1995 Fogleman {{spoke at}} a press conference at the Pentagon in which he {{announced}} the conclusions reached by his review into the accountability of USAF personnel involved in the shootdown incident. He stated that his investigation found that not all the performance evaluations for the individuals involved in the shootdown reflected {{the fact that they had}} received administrative action related to the incident. Fogleman stated, [...] "The fact that the conduct of some individuals did not give rise to criminal prosecution or conviction should not end the inquiry into the appropriateness of their actions. Air Force standards require that people display the extraordinary discipline, judgment, and training that their duties require and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> expect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sessions {{has also}} said {{regarding}} {{the appointment of}} a gay Supreme Court justice, [...] "I do not think that a person who acknowledges that they have gay tendencies is disqualified, per se, for the job" [...] but [...] "that would be a big concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> might feel—might feel uneasy about that".|$|E

5000|$|On the 2011 United States {{debt ceiling}} crisis, Chamberlain praised House {{minority}} leader Nancy Pelosi for {{standing up to}} GOP demands for cuts to Medicare and Social Security. “What we really need is a strong progressive caucus backing up Pelosi,” The Hill quoted Chamberlain as saying, “When it’s Nancy Pelosi versus the president, it’s a tough internal battle for Democrats. I hope they side with Pelosi because <b>that’s</b> what <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> want.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Carter {{was widely}} {{blamed for the}} return of the long gas lines in the summer of 1979 that were last seen just after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He planned on {{delivering}} his fifth major speech on energy, but he felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> were no longer listening. Carter left for the presidential retreat of Camp David. [...] "For more than a week, a veil of secrecy enveloped the proceedings. Dozens of prominent Democratic Party leaders—members of Congress, governors, labor leaders, academics and clergy—were summoned to the mountaintop retreat to confer with the beleaguered president." [...] His pollster, Pat Caddell, told him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> simply faced a crisis of confidence because of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the Vietnam War; and Watergate. On July 15, 1979, Carter gave a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a [...] "crisis of confidence" [...] among the American people. This {{came to be known as}} his [...] "malaise" [...] speech, although Carter never used the word in the speech.|$|E
2500|$|In particular, Adorno despised {{jazz and}} popular music, viewing {{it as part}} of the culture industry, that {{contributes}} to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it [...] "aesthetically pleasing" [...] and [...] "agreeable". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing 'reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Astronomer George Ellery Hale, whose vision {{created the}} Palomar Observatory, built the world's largest {{telescope}} four times. He {{published an article}} in the April 1928 issue of Harper's Magazine called [...] "The Possibilities of Large Telescopes". [...] This article contained Hale's vision for building what was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> would understand and support his project.|$|E

5000|$|Methvin had {{a special}} {{interest}} for stories involving crime, corruption and the Cold War. Among Methvin's favorite targets was labor unions. “I consider myself fortunate to {{have been allowed to}} play the piccolo in the great parade of American democracy for nearly half a century,” Methvin wrote before his death. “During <b>that</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> defeated and brought down two evil empires: the Teamsters Union and the Soviet Union, and I and my piccolo had a hand in both.

5000|$|Churchill was an {{exponent}} of <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British and <b>American</b> <b>people</b> had {{a unique}} greatness and destiny {{and that all}} British history {{should be seen as}} progress towards fulfilling that destiny.

2500|$|At the October 2015 primary debate, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, defended Clinton, saying: [...] "Let me say this. Let me say {{something}} {{that may not be}} great politics. But I think the secretary is right. And that is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> {{are sick and tired of}} hearing about your damn emails!" [...] Sanders later clarified that he thought Clinton's emails were a [...] "very serious issue", but Americans want a discussion on issues that are [...] "real" [...] to them, such as paid family and medical leave, college affordability, and campaign finance reform.|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{continued}} with his address {{by stating that}} ignorant and uneducated individuals can never be [...] "free" [...] (referring to American freedom) and that an educated people will never be enslaved to an oppressive government. Porter then stated that {{it is because of}} institutions like Lafayette <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> might become educated and informed. Giving a brief history of the college, Porter continued by stating that the charter of Lafayette College was granted by Legislature in 1826, and was not aided or endowed by the Commonwealth. He also gave a brief statement of how the college was first a military institution prior to becoming a liberal arts college.|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} as a novel by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 2015. In The New York Times Book Review, Dwight Garner wrote, [...] "I wish I could report <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>People,</b> Volume 1 had power to match its scope. It does not. As a work of sustained passion, it is formidable. As a work of art, it is very modest indeed. The tone is talky and digressive; few real characters emerge; one feels lashed to the mast after only 50 pages or so." [...] In the book, Kramer writes {{that in addition to}} Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, and Richard Nixon were gay.|$|E

5000|$|Rasmussen Reports {{tracks the}} gap between what it labels [...] "Mainstream Voters" [...] and the [...] "Political Class." [...] According to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "To figure out where people are, he Rasmussen asks three questions: Whose {{judgment}} do you trust more: <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> or America's political leaders? Has the federal government become its own special interest group? Do government and big business often work together in ways that hurt consumers and investors? Those who identify with the government on two or more questions are defined as the political class." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{major event}} {{of the year for}} the United States was the stock market crash on Wall Street, which was to have {{international}} effects.

Then, from October 24October 29, stock prices suffered three multi-digit percentage drops, wiping out more than $30 billion from the New York Stock Exchange (10 times greater than the annual budget of the federal government). On December 3 U.S. President Herbert Hoover announced to the U.S. Congress that the worst effects of the recent stock market crash were behind the nation, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> had regained faith in the economy.|$|E
2500|$|On July 23, 2010, Hotline OnCall {{published}} {{statements made}} by Wamp in an interview, {{in which he said}} that the health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration had placed state governments in [...] "an untenable position".

Wamp's statements drew national attention, prompting Wamp to state that his remarks were misinterpreted, and that he did not support secession. Opponent Ron Ramsey labeled the remarks Wamp's [...] "over-the-top temperament and overheated, sometimes crazy rhetoric".|$|E
2500|$|Instead of the 18-nation proposal, the United States {{proposed}} {{an association of}} canal users that would set rules for its operation. 14 of the other nations, not including Pakistan, agreed. Britain, in particular, believed that violation of the association rules would result in military force, but after Eden made a speech to this effect in parliament on 12 September, the US ambassador Dulles insisted [...] "we {{do not intend to}} shoot our way through" [...] the canal. The United States worked hard through diplomatic channels to resolve the crisis without resorting to conflict. [...] "The British and French reluctantly agreed to pursue the diplomatic avenue but viewed it as merely an attempt to buy time, during which they continued their military preparations."

40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Homeland Security Affairs (May 2009), v. 5 no. 2 The nation's homeland security strategy calls on federal, state, and local governments, businesses, communities and individuals {{across the country}} to work together to achieve a shared vision of a secure way of life. Yet true involvement on the part of individual citizens remains elusive, due largely to a misdiagnosis of <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> experience homeland security practices, inappropriate application of border screening and verification techniques to domestic public life, and an incomplete strategic preparedness framework that relies excessively on top-down federal management. This essay argues for a new approach <b>that</b> engages <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> in ways <b>that</b> invite their participation in understanding, assessing, and mitigating risk. New community-oriented techniques are needed that draw heavily on community-policing models and public health philosophies; the federal government needs to invert its strategic planning and funding processes, seizing the moment and leveraging the restructuring of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other priorities as opportunities to put communities first. The new administration has issued a national call to service. This call offers an opportunity to invest in a social infrastructure for homeland security <b>that</b> will bring <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> fully into strengthening their own preparedness...|$|R
5000|$|Steiner often {{followed}} his instincts {{and his own}} reasoning in creating film scores. For example, when he chose to go against Selznick’s instruction to use classic music for Gone With the Wind. Steiner stated: It is my conviction that familiar music, however popular, does not aid the underlying score of a dramatic picture. I believe <b>that,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> are more musically minded than any other nation in the world, they are still not entirely familiar with all {{the old and new}} masters’ works ... Of course there are many in our industry who disagree with my viewpoint.|$|R
50|$|And yet, {{though this}} truth would seem so clear, and the {{importance}} of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, <b>that</b> among <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of its burdens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of our National Bill of Rights.|$|R
