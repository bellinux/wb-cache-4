40|$|This paper explores a {{surprising}} phenomenon: {{the emergence of}} <b>trade</b> <b>associations</b> as agents of environmental performance improvement. <b>Trade</b> <b>associations</b> in the United States have historically fought environmental regulation, not embraced it. <b>Trade</b> <b>associations</b> are generally organized to service {{the needs of their}} members, not control their behavior. Yet, since the late 1980 s, seven <b>trade</b> <b>associations</b> representing manufacturing sectors have enacted codes of practice with the stated goal of enhancing member companies' environmental performance. 	Four of these codes have been developed by <b>trade</b> <b>associations</b> in the chemicals sector. The other <b>trade</b> <b>associations</b> represent oil, forestry, and textile industries. This paper explores why and how <b>trade</b> <b>associations</b> have attempted to exert authority over members' environmental performance. First, the specific factors that caused each <b>trade</b> <b>association</b> to develop its code are discussed. Second, the codes are compared in terms of three dimensions: the environmental practices they require, the techniques used to share values and practices among members, and the authority structures used to ensure compliance. A final section offers observations about the conditions under which codes are likely to emerge and considers their implications for public policy. By seeing where and how this <b>trade</b> <b>association</b> activity is emerging, it is possible to begin to understand the limits, and the potential, of this approach as a tool for moving firms in the direction of environmental performance improvement and sustainability.

In this paper, I measure the activity of 148 major industry <b>trade</b> <b>associations</b> over time and relate this activity {{to the performance of}} the relevant industries and dominant firms within them. Findings suggest that <b>trade</b> <b>association</b> spending increases when the profitability of the four largest firms in an industry decreases but spending is unrelated to the profitability of the industry overall. This implies that large firms exert control over <b>trade</b> <b>association</b> agendas and may use these communal organizations to advance their own interests rather than the shared interests of the entire industry.
