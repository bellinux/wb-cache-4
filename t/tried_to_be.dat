5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as serious and determined.|$|E
5|$|Emil Pagliarulo, {{a former}} writer at Looking Glass Studios, was {{commissioned}} by Bethesda to write the main script of Fallout 3; although he worked in part to 's script. Pagliarulo took charge of writing the incipit of Fallout 3, then played by Ron Perlman, and he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inspired by first Fallout's incipit, in 1997, which he considered vitally important to describe the story that Fallout 3 would have to tell. To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, {{had to go in}} the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} town was at the centre of Puritan {{emigration}} to America, and the local rector, John White, organised the settlement of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The first colonisation attempted was at Cape Ann, where fishermen who would rejoin the fishing fleet when the vessels returned the next year, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-sufficient. However, the land was unsuitable, the colony failed and was moved {{to what is now}} Salem. In 1628 the enterprise received a Royal Charter and the Massachusetts Bay Company was formed with three hundred colonists arriving in America that year and more the following year.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E
5|$|The swiftgate scandal {{broke out}} in 1990, as American investors were damaged by a case of corruption, and asked for {{assistance}} from the United States' Ambassador Terence Todman. Most of the ministers resigned {{as a result of}} it. Cavallo was reassigned as minister of economy, and his successful economic plan turned him into a prominent figure in Menem's cabinet. Cavallo brought a number of independent economists to the cabinet, and Menem supported him by replacing Peronist politicians. Both teams complemented each other. Both Menem and Cavallo <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recognized as the designer of the convertibility plan.|$|E
5|$|So far, no {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} synthesize any element {{that could be the}} next group 3 element; if lutetium and lawrencium are considered to be group 3 elements, then the next element in the group should be element 153, unpenttrium (Upt). However, after element 120, filling electronic configurations stops obeying Aufbau principle. According to the principle, unpenttrium should have an electronic configuration of 8s25g186f147d1 and filling the 5g-subshell should be stopped at element 138. However, the 7d-orbitals are calculated to start being filled on element 137, while the 5g-subshell closes only at element 144, after filling of 7d-subshell begins. Therefore, it is hard to calculate which element should be the next group 3 element. Calculations suggest that unpentpentium (Upp, element 155) could also be the next group 3 element. If lanthanum and actinium are considered group 3 elements, then element 121, unbiunium (Ubu), should be the fifth group 3 element. The element is calculated have electronic configuration of 8s28p1/21, which is not associated with transition metals, without having a partially filled d-subshell. No experiments have been performed to create unpenttrium, unbiunium or any element that could be considered the next group 3 element; however, unbiunium is the element with the lowest atomic number that has not been <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> created and thus has chances to be, while unpenttrium, unpentpentium or any other element considered if preceded by lawrencium is very unlikely to be created due to drip instabilities that imply that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium.|$|E

5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

60|$|It <b>is</b> {{necessary}} <b>to</b> {{make this}} first point clear: that in Great Expectations Dickens <b>was</b> really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a quiet, a detached, {{and even a}} cynical observer of human life. Dickens <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Thackeray. And the final and startling triumph of Dickens is this: that even to this moderate and modern story, he gives an incomparable energy which is not moderate and which is not modern. He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reasonable; {{but in spite of}} himself he is inspired. He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detailed, but in spite of himself he <b>is</b> gigantic. Compared <b>to</b> the rest of Dickens this is Thackeray; but compared to the whole of Thackeray we can only say in supreme praise of it that it is Dickens.|$|R

25|$|For Protestants, the Presbyterians, {{who were}} largely {{involved}} in the rebellion of 1798 would shed no tears over {{the end of the}} Irish parliament. The Orange Order <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> neutral on the issue of union, however thirty-six lodges from counties Armagh and Louth alone petitioned against the Union. The fear for some Protestants, especially those part of the Protestant Ascendancy, was that Catholic emancipation would immediately follow any union. The artisans and merchants of Dublin also feared any union as it may have resulted in a loss of business.|$|E
25|$|In {{the run-up}} to the war and its early stages, militias <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> politically-orientated non-sectarian forces, but due to the sectarian nature of Lebanese society, they inevitably gained their support from the same {{community}} as their leaders came from. In the long run almost all militias openly identified with a given community. The two main alliances were the Lebanese Front, consisting of nationalist Maronites who were against Palestinian militancy in Lebanon, and the Lebanese National Movement, which consisted of pro-Palestinian Leftists. The LNM dissolved after the Israeli invasion of 1982 and was replaced by the Lebanese National Resistance Front, known as Jammoul in Arabic.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Nehru had criticised {{the joint}} {{invasion}} of the Suez Canal by the British, French and Israelis. The role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime Minister and {{a leader of the}} Non-Aligned Movement was significant; he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> even-handed between the two sides, while denouncing Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion vigorously. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout in the International Monetary Fund to make Britain and France back down. The episode greatly raised the prestige of Nehru and India among the third world nations. During the Suez crisis, Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant Gamal Nasser to compromise with the West, and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise.|$|E
