Van Hollen faced no serious threat to his bid for a third term from Republican Jeffrey Stein or Green Party candidate Gerard Giblin, and he crushed both of them in the general election.|$|E

25|$|The Democrats' {{dominant}} worldview {{was once}} social conservatism and economic liberalism, while—especially {{in the rural}} South—populism was its leading characteristic. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt ran as a third-party candidate in the Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party, leading to a switch of political platforms between the Democratic and Republican Party and Woodrow Wilson being elected as the first fiscally progressive Democrat. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> also promoted a social liberal platform, supporting social justice.|$|E

However, some Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue. In the national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the most}} recent Gallup poll, 25% of Americans {{identify}} as Republican and 16% identify as leaning Republican.

25|$|All five statewide winners {{carried it}} in November 2004. Although the Republican Party has {{historically}} been dominant in county-level politics, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> made substantial inroads this decade. In 2005, Bethlehem Mayor Don Cunningham unseated incumbent County Executive Jane Ervin {{to become the first}} Democrat to be elected to the office. Four of the nine commissioner seats and all row offices except for the District Attorney have held by Democrats since winning two at-large seats in November 2007. Lehigh County has a home-rule charter with four at-large and five district commissioners. In 2006 Lehigh County voters approved a county-charter amendment to combine the offices of Clerk of Courts, Register of Wills, and Recorder of Deeds into the office of the Clerk of Judicial Records. Clerk of Courts Andrea Naugle won the new office in November 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{had been}} {{historically}} dominant in county-level politics; {{prior to the}} Great Depression Pittsburgh and Allegheny County had been Republican. Since the Great Depression on the state and national levels, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> been dominant in county-level politics and is the Democratic stronghold of western Pennsylvania. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore won 56% of the vote and Republican George W. Bush won 41%. In 2004, Democrat John Kerry received 57% of the vote and Republican Bush received 42%. In 2006, Democrats Governor Ed Rendell and Senator Bob Casey, Jr. won 59% and 65% {{of the vote in}} Allegheny County, respectively.

25|$|Republicans {{have responded}} to the influx of non-white {{immigrants}} by making more explicit efforts to court the Hispanic and Asian vote. In 2004, George W. Bush captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000, despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide compared with the 2000 election. Although Barbara Boxer won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican Bill Jones defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that John Kerry received is higher than the percentage Bill Clinton won in both 1992 and 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (59.7% of the vote) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator Dianne Feinstein won 45% of the vote in the county, the highest margin of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only Coastal California county to vote for her Republican opponent Dick Mountjoy. In terms of voter registration, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> a plurality or majority of registrations only in the cities of Buena Park, Laguna Beach, Santa Ana and Stanton.|$|E

25|$|Municipal {{elections}} in St. Louis {{are held in}} odd numbered years, with the primary {{elections in}} March and the general election in April. The mayor is elected in odd numbered years following the United States Presidential Election, as are the aldermen representing odd-numbered wards.

500|$|The 1951 {{election}} {{was the final}} blow to Philadelphia's once-dominant Republican machine. After winning some minor offices in 1953, the Republican organization quickly declined again. Since that time, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> dominated the city's politics, with no other party electing a mayor or {{a majority of the}} city council. With Republicans no longer playing a significant role in Philadelphia's government, the main battle in city politics came to be between the Democratic Party's reformers and its organization stalwarts. By 1965, with most reformers out of government, the ascendant political culture in the city returned to what the Philadelphia Bulletin called [...] "the old, narrow partisan view, the aroma of inside deals, back-scratching, and City Hall favoritism... crass political bidding for favor at taxpayers' expense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kucinich campaigned {{heavily in}} Oregon, {{spending}} 30 days {{there during the}} two {{months leading up to}} the state's May 18 primary.

[...] He won 16% of the vote.|$|E

2500|$|Upon foundation, the Democratic Party {{supported}} agrarianism, and the Jacksonian {{democracy movement}} of President Andrew Jackson, representing farmers and rural interests, and traditional Jeffersonian democrats. Since the 1890s, {{the party has}} favored liberal positions (the term [...] "liberal" [...] in this sense describes modern liberalism, rather than classical liberalism or economic liberalism). In recent exit polls, <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> had broad appeal across all socio-ethno-economic demographics.|$|E
2500|$|Adelson denies those {{explanations}} {{for his political}} beliefs and behavior, suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics' own political ideology. He stated, [...] "My critics nowadays like to claim it's because I got wealthy or because I didn't want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature. No, the truth is <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, the county's {{rapid growth}} in its eastern portion, settled by educated {{professionals}} working in or near Washington, D.C., has changed the demographics, and <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> become increasingly competitive in the county. After giving Senator Barack Obama nearly 54% of its presidential vote in 2008, the county supported Republican Bob McDonnell in 2009, who received 61% of the gubernatorial vote. Voters also replaced two incumbent Democratic delegates, making Loudoun's state House delegation all-Republican. In 2012 county voters again supported Obama, who took 51.5% of the vote, with Republican challenger Mitt Romney garnering 47%.|$|E
