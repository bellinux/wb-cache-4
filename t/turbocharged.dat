5|$|Brabham {{had been}} working with the German engine {{manufacturer}} BMW since 1980 on the development of a <b>turbocharged</b> engine for Formula One. The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured <b>turbocharged</b> cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next two races. Piquet finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced underweight due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before coolants were topped up, resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside Piquet in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next two races, taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Engineering {{requirements}} {{resulted in}} significant {{changes to the}} specification of the XJ220, most notably replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a <b>turbocharged</b> V6 engine. The changes to the specification and a collapse {{in the price of}} collectible cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making it their most expensive car during its debut.|$|E

Andretti dominated the 1987 Indianapolis 500, leading 170 of the first 177 laps of the race. His lead was so large, that he was advised to slow his pace to preserve his equipment. In a cruel twist of fate, when Andretti started running slower, his reduced engine rpm's created a harmonic imbalance in his <b>turbocharged</b> Ilmor/Chevrolet V8 {{that led to a}} broken valve spring with 20 laps to go.|$|E

40|$|<b>Turbocharging</b> {{is a way}} to stay {{competitive}} on {{the market}} where there are increasing demands on fuel consumption and engine performance. <b>Turbocharging</b> lets the engine work closer to its maximum power and thereby reduces the relative losses due to pumping and friction.

5|$|Renault had {{introduced}} <b>turbocharged</b> engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a BMW four-cylinder M12 <b>turbocharged</b> engine {{in the summer}} of 1981. For the 1982 season the team designed a new car, the BT50, around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a road car engine block, the BMW M10. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D {{in the early part of}} the season while reliability and driveability issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the Canadian Grand Prix. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers Riccardo Patrese, who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the Monaco Grand Prix, 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the 1983 season, Piquet took the championship lead from Renault's Alain Prost at the last race of the year, the South African Grand Prix to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. Riccardo Patrese was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new <b>turbocharged</b> engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally naturally aspirated, TWR needed to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals, and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts. It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E
5|$|As Q3 started, Lewis Hamilton {{stopped in}} the pit lane {{with a loss of}} power and was pushed back into the garage. He was {{eventually}} able to go on track and qualified third, after starting several quick laps only to abandon them to leave his final run to the last moment. He was however beaten to pole position by Ricciardo, who was almost three-tenths of a second faster than second placed Rosberg, with Vettel following in fourth almost a second slower. Nico Hülkenberg managed fifth ahead of Kimi Räikkönen, who was to serve a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, leaving him eleventh on the grid. Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Fernando Alonso rounded up the top ten.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. <b>Turbocharging</b> {{is used as}} a means to {{downsize}} petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. The introduction of a <b>turbocharger</b> means that a throttle body is included in the petrol engine downstream of the <b>turbocharger</b> compressor. Due to the presence of this throttle valve, flow is restricted through the outlet pipe of the <b>turbocharger</b> during low load engine operation. For example, during transient tip out – tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the <b>turbocharger</b> operating in near surge or surge conditions. Surge noise generated during this stage is clearly audible and can also affect the durable life of the compressor and other rotor systems of the <b>turbocharger.</b> This paper describes an experimental method to predict and measure the <b>turbocharger</b> surge noise. An experimental <b>turbocharger</b> noise rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained. Using a time and frequency analysis of the measured data the fundamental mechanism of noise generation is identified. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed...|$|R
5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for <b>turbocharged),</b> while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
5|$|No.1 AD {{undertook}} {{research and}} development on various aircraft types, including Supermarine Spitfires, CAC Boomerangs, and Wackett Woomeras. It also ran comparative performance studies on Spitfires, Boomerangs, Kittyhawks, Brewster Buffalos, and Mitsubishi Zeros. In {{the case of the}} Boomerang, 105 CA-12 models were delivered to No.1 AD for testing between July 1942 and June 1943. As soon as the aircraft began arriving, the depot commenced handling and armament trials that continued for six months, identifying and overcoming such issues as the aircraft's guns freezing at high altitudes, and unusual levels of carbon monoxide in the cockpit. Fighter aces Alan Rawlinson and Wilfred Arthur, along with a United States Army Air Forces pilot, conducted comparative trials between a Boomerang, a Kittyhawk, a Buffalo, and a Bell Airacobra. The depot began despatching the Boomerangs to their operational units in March 1943, and the following month performance-tested a <b>turbocharged</b> version of the CA-14, though this model never entered production. No.1 AD's Special Duties and Performance Flight was responsible for conducting performance trials during the early war years; in December 1943 it became a separate organisation, No.1 Aircraft Performance Unit, which would evolve into the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) in 1947.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{took over}} the IMSA GT Championship {{operation}} in 1988 and one model– Jaguar XJR-9– was launched to compete in both series. The XJR-9, which retained the Jaguar V12 engine, {{went on to win}} the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sportscar Championship in the same year. The poor fuel consumption of the Jaguar V12 combined with new rules restricting refueling during races forced the replacement of the V12 engine in the XJR-9s successors, the XJR-10 and XJR-11. The normally-aspirated Austin Rover V64V engine, designed for the MG Metro 6R4 had recently been made redundant thanks to the Group B rally ban in 1987, and the design rights were for sale. The compact, lightweight and fuel efficient nature of the small-displacement, <b>turbocharged</b> engine was investigated by TWR, who considered it an ideal basis for a new engine to power the XJR-10 and purchased the design rights from Austin Rover Group.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{technology}} of <b>turbocharger</b> {{has been used}} with internal combustion engines since 1905 to increase intake air pressure prior to putting it into the cylinders to increase thermal efficiency of the engine. Based on previous researches and uses of turbochargers, the pattern of <b>turbocharger</b> installation remains the same, either in series or in parallel. Therefore, this research aims to study installation of the combined <b>turbocharger.</b> The combined <b>turbocharger</b> set comprised two turbochargers {{of the same size}} having exhaust turbine connected in parallel to let both turbochargers work simultaneously and having intake air compressor connected in series for two stage compress. Approach: This research aimed to study the thermal efficiency of a combined <b>turbocharger</b> set with gasoline engine. The study was done by comparing the thermal efficiency between the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set and the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> set. The variation of both temperature and pressure of the intake air and exhaust gas were also investigated. The engine used in the study was TOYOTA engine model 1 JZ-GTE with six cylinders and a total displacement volume of 2, 491 cc. The engine was already installed with parallel <b>turbocharger</b> from the factory, therefore, the thermal efficiency test of the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> case was conducted first. Then, the engine was modified to be a combined <b>turbocharger</b> set and tested by the same procedure. The test was run under the speed of 2, 000 - 5, 000 rpm. Results: According to the test, the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set gave higher thermal efficiency than the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> set in all range of speed. At the speed of 2, 500, 3, 000, 3, 500, 4, 000, 4, 500 and 5, 000 rpm, the thermal efficiency of the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set was equal to 39. 37, 57. 73, 79. 30, 67. 66, 60. 63 and 55. 05 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the thermal efficiency of the parallel <b>turbocharger</b> set was equal to 15. 40, 22. 61, 44. 96, 55. 21, 56. 38 and 52. 24 %, respectively. Conclusion: It could be seen that the thermal efficiency of the combined <b>turbocharger</b> set was higher than that of the parallel set by 2. 55 times at the speed range of 2, 500 - 3, 000 rpm. The efficiency of the combined <b>turbocharger</b> would be equal or higher than that of the parallel set by 1. 05 times at the speed of 5, 000 rpm...|$|R

40|$|Engine {{boosting}} via <b>turbocharging</b> is {{a method}} to increase the engine power output with minimal or no increase in engine parasitic, frictional and pumping losses. <b>Turbocharging</b> in conjunction with engine down-sizing and down-speeding allows a reduction of engine fuel consumption, while maintaining a high engine power output. However, <b>turbocharging</b> introduces a lag in engine transient response, caused by the finite amount of time required by the <b>turbocharger</b> to accelerate, which has to be minimized. Electric <b>turbocharger</b> assistance consists of coupling an electric motor/generator to a standard <b>turbocharger.</b> The scope of the motor/generator {{is to increase the}} power available to accelerate the rotor assembly, so that the time to boost is reduced. The motor/generator could also be utilized to brake the <b>turbocharger</b> to control boost and avoid over-speeds, thus replacing the conventional waste-gate. Furthermore, electric assistance allows turbocompounding to be implemented. Turbocompounding improves the engine efficiency by utilizing the turbine and motor/generator to recuperate additional exhaust flow energy. In this thesis, the electric <b>turbocharger</b> assistance impact on the <b>turbocharger</b> and engine performance is studied. An electrically assisted <b>turbocharger</b> prototype has been developed by industrial partners and it has been tested by the author of this thesis. The performance of the <b>turbocharger</b> turbine and motor/generator has been characterized over the full speed range and the impact of the electric assistance on the turbine flow has been investigated experimentally.
