40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{availability}} of an alternative reinforcer on responding maintained by food pellets or fluid solutions were examined in 6 adult male baboons (Papio cynocephalus anubis). During daily 23 -hr experimental sessions, baboons had concurrent access <b>to</b> both food <b>pellets</b> and fluid, with responding maintained under fixed-ratio schedules of reinforcement that varied between the two commodities. The fixed-ratio requirement, or cost, for pellets was increased when (a) no fluid, (b) a dilute dextrose vehicle, (c) 0. 002 mg/kg d-amphetamine, or (d) 0. 004 mg/kg d-amphetamine was available. When given nonrestricted concurrent access <b>to</b> food <b>pellets</b> and amphetamine at minimal cost (FR 2), baboons self-administered sufficient amphetamine <b>to</b> decrease <b>pellet</b> intake. Increasing the response requirement for pellets decreased pellet intake at a similar rate regardless of the available fluid and increased fluid intake in a variable manner among baboons such that there were no statistically significant increases in fluid intake. In contrast, when access <b>to</b> <b>pellets</b> was restricted <b>to</b> 70 % of maximal intake under nonrestricted conditions, increasing pellet cost decreased pellet intake and increased fluid intake more rapidly when the high amphetamine dose was available. Thus, amphetamine was more effective as an economic substitute for <b>pellets</b> when access <b>to</b> <b>pellets</b> was restricted. The response cost for vehicle and both amphetamine concentrations was increased when baboons had nonrestricted and restricted access <b>to</b> <b>pellets.</b> Increasing the response requirement for fluid delivery decreased intake of all three fluids similarly under both pellet-access conditions. The results indicate that substitution between commodities with minimal commonalities can be studied under controlled laboratory conditions and is dependent upon reinforcement schedule and commodity restrictions...|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to the high casualties caused by use of pellet guns, Rajnath Singh announced that a panel would be set up to look for alternatives <b>to</b> <b>pellet</b> guns. During a visit to Kashmir, he asked the security forces to avoid using pellet guns as much as possible. The Director-General of Central Reserve Police Force, K. Durga Prasad, in a statement issued on 25 July, regretted the injuries Kashmiri civilians received due {{to the use of}} the guns but said that they were the least lethal option available to control the protesting crowd and assured they will only be used in most extreme situations. Lieutenant general D. S. Hooda, chief of the Northern Command of the Indian Army, supported his claim regarding pellet guns. Prasad's comments were criticised by Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Amarinder Singh as well as Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami, the state chief of CPI-M.|$|E

40|$|Every {{year about}} 210 000 tones dry weight {{of sewage sludge}} is {{produced}} in Sweden. Most of the sludge is applied to agricultural land, plantsoil and landfill cover. Sewage sludge contains essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Nitrogen is limiting growth on solid ground in Sweden and can therefore be used as fertilizer to increase productivity. In order that the sludge can be spread to forest land it requires first a conversion of sludge <b>to</b> <b>pellets,</b> <b>to</b> make it more manageable. Sludge contains in average of four percent nitrogen. In {{order to get the}} same application amount of nitrogen as for mineral fertilizers about seven times more sewage sludge has to be applied to the land. The problem is that the sludge contains organic pollutants and heavy metals. Sewage sludge also contains pathogens, but they are killed efficiently when the sludge is converting <b>to</b> <b>pellets.</b> It is possible <b>to</b> use sludge <b>pellets</b> as an alternative to mineral fertilization. Of a total of 6780 hectares in Krycklan is possible to fertilize 1748 according the Forest Agency guidelines for nitrogen fertilization and seven demands...|$|R

50|$|This {{method of}} cooking, known as {{indirect}} (or convection) cooking {{is also used}} by traditional charcoal and wood smokers. That similarity, {{and the fact that}} wood pellets produce smoke that flavors food, resulted in many early adopters turning <b>to</b> <b>pellet</b> grills as an easy-to-use alternative to traditional smokers. Joe Traeger worked to combine the best elements of gas and charcoal grills. The Traeger Grill revolutionized smoking by bringing the ability to slow-cook authentic BBQ to the masses with simplicity and convenience. Like a gas grill, Traeger Grills has a continuous fuel source—once the hopper is loaded with pellets, the auger repeatedly and automatically feeds them into the fire pot at predetermined intervals. The ability to cook at a relatively consistent temperature for hours without tending physical coal or wood fires appealed to BBQers who had become accustomed to tending smokers during long day or overnight cooks.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{in which}} pellet grill {{manufacturers}} have distinguished themselves from similar brands is by continuing to evolve and add technology. In a constantly wired world, it's no surprise that pellet grills would develop the WiFi compatibility available on Traeger Wood Fired Grills, Memphis Wood Fire Grills, and Boneless Grills. However, the technology isn't exclusive to premium models. Green Mountain Grills began offering each of their pellet grills with a WiFi-enabled control panel {{that allows you to}} monitor and control your cooks through a smartphone or tablet. This is not something offered from all manufacturers, Rec Tec Grills produce WiFi grills while Black Olive Grills has differentiated itself by applying pellet grill technology to a traditional ceramic Kamado grill. Uuni sells a pizza oven that integrates pellet grill technology. It's a trend that seems likely to continue as some manufacturers add new technology <b>to</b> <b>pellet</b> grills and others attempt to add pellet grill technology to traditional grills.|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{an optimal}} {{pelleting}} production rate {{can be difficult}} when manufacturing feeds for meat birds. Increased production time {{may be required to}} fill feed demand and feed outages occur if demand is not met. Identifying management strategies to enhance overall feed production rate without compromising broiler performance is warranted. This study examined the effects of adding varying amounts of corn, ground through a roller mill, <b>to</b> <b>pelleted</b> supplements on feed production parameters, growth performance, and intestinal strength of broiler chickens. Four treatments were used from 18 to 41 d, which included a control (total diet pelleted), and addition of rolled corn <b>to</b> <b>pelleted</b> supplements at 15, 25, and 35 % of the corn required in diet formulation. The final diets fed were identical in nutrient composition. Decreasing the amount of ground corn in the pelleted supplement did not affect pellet durability index in the grower diet, but pellet quality declined in the finisher diet. The dietary treatments did not adversely affect final BW gain or feed conversion. Progressive additions of ground corn <b>to</b> <b>pelleted</b> supplement did not affect gizzard weight or peak force intestinal strength. These data indicate that 35 % of the formula corn can be added postpellet to reduce electrical cost for grinding and pelleting and improve overall production rate without adversely affecting cumulative growth performance of broilers...|$|R
5000|$|Differential {{centrifugation}} is {{a common}} procedure in microbiology and cytology used to separate certain organelles from whole cells for further analysis of specific parts of cells. In the process, a tissue sample is first lysed to break the cell membranes and mix up the cell contents. The lysate is then subjected to repeated centrifugations, each time removing the pellet and increasing the centrifugal force. Finally, purification may be done through equilibrium sedimentation, and the desired layer is extracted for further analysis. Separation is based on size and density, with larger and denser particles pelleting at lower centrifugal forces. As an example, unbroken whole cells will pellet at low speeds and short intervals such as 1,000g for 5 minutes. Smaller cell fragments and organelles remain in the supernatant and require more force and greater times <b>to</b> <b>pellet.</b> In general, one can enrich for the following cell components, in the separating order in actual application: ...|$|E
5000|$|Much of Maine Energy Systems {{work to make}} wood pellet heating more {{prevalent}} in the Northeast has been with regulatory agencies. At the time MESys was founded very few regulations existed which directly referred to Wood Pellet boilers in Maine and the surrounding regions. As a result, rules and regulations created to regulate the installation and use of cordwood and coal stoker boilers were frequently applied <b>to</b> <b>pellet</b> boilers. Co-Owner Dr. Harry [...] "Dutch" [...] Dresser Jr. {{has been instrumental in}} helping to achieve parity in heating regulations between wood pellet heating appliances and conventional liquid and gaseous fuel appliances in some jurisdictions. Regulations which directly address wood pellet heat have existed for decades in various countries in Europe; the majority of new construction in Upper Austria is heated with wood pellet boilers. As wood pellet boilers gain use in the United States it is necessary that regulations be devised which directly address appropriate wood pellet boiler use. Currently the lack of wood pellet fuel based appliance regulations requires regulatory agencies to hold wood pellet boilers to standards established for a different solid fuel source, such as cordwood, even though the manually fed operation of a cordwood boiler bears no resemblance to the operation of an automatic wood pellet boiler. Regulatory changes that have been made to directly address wood pellet boilers through Maine Energy Systems involvement include the following: ...|$|E
50|$|Fayaz Ahamad Lone, {{the senior}} {{superintendent}} of police (SSP) of Budgam district who {{had ordered the}} police forces to raid press offices and stop the publication of newspapers, {{was transferred to the}} State Disaster Response Fund as a commandant. Two officers were later transferred from South Kashmir, which has been most affected by the violent protests: the deputy inspector general of police in South Kashmir and the senior superintendent of police in Anantnag. The SSP in Srinagar was directed on 19 July by a local court to register a case against a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and other police personnel for allegedly murdering an innocent youth after breaking into his house during the unrest on 10 July. It also ordered that the case could not be investigated by anyone below the rank of DSP. Instead of registering a case against the DSP, the state police registered a case against the youth over various offenses and alleged that he was leading a procession on the day he was killed. The court rejected the argument and ordered the SSP to register a case against the DSP within a day. A non-bailable warrant was later issued against the SSP for not obeying the court order and registering a case within the allotted time-period. The SSP was produced in the court by the Deputy Inspector General of Police of Central Kashmir and was granted bail while being ordered to file his statement and register the case against the accused DSP A petition against the filing of the report against the DSP was dismissed by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court who directed the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Srinagar to initiate contempt proceedings against the SSP if the report was not registered. The Supreme Court however stayed the contempt proceedings against the SSP as well as the Inspector General of Police in Kashmir on 9 August.
