500|$|In 1925, the spectre of {{deportation}} loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named James Colton {{offered to}} marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: [...] "I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive." [...] She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were [...] "awful," [...] and she never finished her second book on the subject.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal contested {{the final}} against Chelsea on 4 May 2002. Wenger {{recalled}} Seaman in goal {{from the previous}} fixture, in place of Wright while Campbell was paired up with Adams in central defence. For Chelsea, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Graeme Le Saux passed late fitness tests and were named in the first team; John Terry filled the substitutes bench, having woken up with a virus. Chelsea threatened early with goal efforts from Le Saux and midfielder Frank Lampard, before Bergkamp fashioned the first real chance of the match – he headed the ball over the top, which caught goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini off his line. In the 70th minute Arsenal took the lead: Adams found Wiltord in space, who in turn passed the ball towards Parlour – he kicked [...] "from just beyond the arc", which flew into the top right corner. Ten minutes after, Ljungberg increased the lead, running from the half-way line and shrung off a late challenge by Terry to curl the ball past Cudicini. The win meant Arsenal completed one half of an expected double; Wenger {{was pleased with the}} team's performance, adding: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We have shown a lot of strength <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said {{three or four months}} ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Ben assumed major {{leadership}} responsibilities as the Chairman of the Durham Housing Authority.

This project promised greater opportunities and improved living conditions for Durham’s black residents as many were restricted to substandard housing and the [...] "slum life". When Ruffin learned that builders weren’t putting adequate insulation and firewalls into houses, he went to building sites and stated, “I asked for nice homes for my people and you’re not going to just throw anything together, you’re going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> in <b>here</b> and do these walls.” The builders then corrected their methods, and the houses were built to code.|$|R

60|$|Nor was Rowan slow {{to answer}} him. He {{was proud to}} say that he was Bungall's heir, and as such he {{intended}} to continue Bungall's business. Whether he could improve the quality of the old tap he didn't know, but he would try. People had said a few weeks ago that he had been hounded out of Baslehurst, and did not mean <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> again. <b>Here</b> he was. He had bought property in Baslehurst. He meant to live in Baslehurst. He pledged himself to brew beer in Baslehurst. He already regarded himself as belonging to Baslehurst. And, being a bachelor, he hoped that he might live to marry a wife out of Baslehurst. This last assurance was received with unqualified applause from both factions, and went far in obtaining for Rowan that local popularity which was needful to him. Certainly the Rowan contest added much to the popular interest of that election.|$|R

5000|$|Collins is {{sometimes}} {{reported in the}} British press to have left the UK and moved to Switzerland in protest at the Labour Party's victory in the 1997 general election. Shortly before the 2005 election (when Collins was living in Switzerland), Labour supporter Noel Gallagher was quoted: [...] "Vote Labour. If you don't and the Tories get in, Phil Collins is threatening <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and live <b>here.</b> And let's face it, none of us want that." [...] However, Collins has since stated that although he did once claim many years earlier that he might leave Britain if most of his income was taken in tax, which was Labour Party policy at that time for top earners, {{he has never been}} a Conservative Party supporter and he left Britain for Switzerland in 1994 purely because he started a relationship with a woman who lived there. He said of Gallagher: [...] "I don't care if he likes my music or not. I do care if he starts telling people I'm a wanker because of my politics. It's an opinion based on an old, misunderstood quote." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} we do not wish you to do, Signore," [...] {{answered}} the lieutenant, with interest.

We wish by all means to get possession of the lugger, which, in smooth water, is the fastest craft in the Mediterranean, and would be of infinite service to us. We think the Proserpine would prove too much for her, blowing fresh; but in moderate weather she will go six feet to our five. Now if you open on her she will either escape or be sunk; for Raoul Yvard is not a man to strike to a town. All I ask is to be permitted to make night-signals, for which I am prepared, as soon as the frigate approaches, and that you will throw all the delays, by means of forms and permits, in the way of the Frenchman's sailing, until to-morrow morning. We will answer for the rest." ...|$|R
