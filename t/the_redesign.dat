5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was {{required}} to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress to pass a bill requiring <b>the</b> <b>redesign,</b> they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> of United States coinage that had begun in 1907.|$|E
5|$|After Jonathan Martin's arson {{attack on}} York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were {{proposals}} by the dean and chapter {{to take the}} opportunity of the destruction to restructure {{the interior of the}} building. Etty was prominent in the effort to resist <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> and to restore the building to its original state. A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E

5|$|Deeply {{involved}} {{in the investigation of}} the 1967 Apollo 1 fire, Shea suffered a nervous breakdown {{as a result of the}} stress that he suffered. He was removed from his position and left NASA shortly afterwards. From 1968 until 1990 he worked as a senior manager at Raytheon in Lexington, Massachusetts, and thereafter became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. While Shea served as a consultant for NASA on <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> of the International Space Station in 1993, he was forced to resign from the position due to health issues.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Toshiba {{took over}} {{sponsorship}} of the top-most screen of One Times Square from Discover Card in a 10-year lease. Throughout 2008, upgrades began {{to be made to}} the upper portion of One Times Square; including the installation of new Toshiba high definition LED displays (known as ToshibaVision), and <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> of its roof to accommodate a larger New Year's Eve ball, which became a year-round fixture of the building beginning in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Smartsheet {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was too difficult to use. At {{the end of its}} first year, it had only 10,000 users. The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more user-friendly. Following the 2010 launch of <b>the</b> <b>redesign,</b> adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.|$|E

5|$|The V64V engine chosen had a {{short but}} {{successful}} career as a purpose-designed racing car engine. It was designed by Cosworth engine designer David Wood for Austin Rover Group's Metro derived Group B rally car, the MG Metro 6R4. <b>The</b> <b>redesign</b> work necessary to create the Jaguar/TWR JV6 engine was undertaken by Andrew Barnes, TWR's Powertrain Manager, and also involved Swiss engine builder Max Heidegger who had designed and built the race engines used in the XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{restarted}} in 1981, largely as an interim measure while the stealth bomber entered service. This {{led to a}} redesign as the B-1B, which had lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25, but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96. The electronics were also extensively improved during <b>the</b> <b>redesign,</b> and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load. The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with Strategic Air Command (SAC) as a nuclear bomber in 1986. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delivered.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} {{illuminated}} by two-tierd bronze chandeliers, each featuring 12 distinct lighting groups holding candle-like bulbs. The chandeliers, designed by Stanislav Adamenko and Mariya Ralko, were installed between the mosaic stripes. Both the station halls and the underground vestibule feature similar light fixtures, {{although they are}} significantly smaller than the main chandeliers. <b>The</b> <b>redesign</b> also called for a gold smalt-covered ceiling, although this was rejected as it was too expensive. To finish it off, gray granite was used on the floor.|$|E

40|$|An {{existing}} {{sensor system}} for a subsea oil tool was evaluated {{in order to identify}} and eliminate causes of failure in the system. The existing contact switches were replaced with non-contact sensors that use reed switch technology, and the components of <b>the</b> system were <b>redesigned</b> to improve reliability by preventing ingress of hydraulic control fluid. Prototypes of <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> system were built and tested to validate the most critical design points. Experimental testing concluded that <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> system can reliably seal out fluid and prevent electrical shorting, and that <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> sensors are able to operate even in areas where there is significant magnetic interference...|$|R

5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|They were {{supported}} by architects Anatoliy Krushynskyi, Tamara Tselikovska, and Fedir Zaremba, who were responsible for designing the underground vestibule. While <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued. The new design {{was based on the}} form of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white ceiling was divided with diametrical mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko.|$|E
5|$|Actor J. K. Simmons {{expressed}} interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy should the studio offer it to him. In October 2012, Electro was rumored as the next villain. Jamie Foxx was given the role. That December, Foxx confirmed that he was cast as the character, and during an interview with MTV, explained that <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> of the character would be more grounded as well as details of his depiction, which were based upon the Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Electro. On December 3, 2012, Marc Webb revealed that Dane DeHaan was chosen to play Harry Osborn. Paul Giamatti was confirmed as a cast member in February 2013. Felicity Jones confirmed her involvement with the film under an undisclosed role. Giamatti also indicated in an October 2013 interview that he would return in The Amazing Spider-Man 3 as well. On February 27, 2013, Chris Cooper was cast as Norman Osborn.|$|E

5|$|Ashbrook was {{defeated}} {{for re-election in}} the 1920 elections; at that time congressional terms did not end until March 4 of the following year. He was friendly with the new committee chairman Albert Henry Vestal (Republican–Indiana), and persuaded him to schedule {{a hearing on the}} peace coin proposal for December 14, 1920. Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design. The committee took no immediate action; in March 1921, after the Harding administration took office, Vestal met with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker about the matter, finding them supportive so long as <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> involved no expense.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} George Luttrell {{inherited}} the castle in 1571, it was dilapidated, {{with the family}} preferring to live in their house, now known as Court House, at East Quantoxhead. In 1617 George employed the architect William Arnold, {{to create a new}} house in the Lower Ward of the castle. Arnold was an important architect in the south-west of England, and had managed the building of nearby Montacute and Cranborne House. <b>The</b> <b>redesign</b> expanded on some of the existing buildings and walls to create a 16th-century Jacobean mansion with a symmetrical front and square towers, set within the older castle walls and overlooked by the keep above. The building was decorated in the latest styles, including ornamental plaster ceilings. The project ran almost three times over budget, costing Luttrell more than £1,200.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{involved}} himself {{heavily in}} discussions over army reform, {{the need for}} which had become apparent with the failings of the Boer War. He supported <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> of army command, {{the creation of the}} Territorial Force, and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany. Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the Imperial German Navy as a new strategic threat. Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir John Fisher, who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new dreadnoughts.|$|E
40|$|This project {{evaluated}} the effectiveness gained by redesigning a user interface {{based on the}} knowledge structure of domain experts. Scenario-based simulation enables realistic training in synthetic environments. As the instructor remains essential to facilitating effective scenario-based training, their user interface should be efficient. Previous research modeled knowledge structures used to redesign a menu within a scenario generation interface. The current research evaluated <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> menu based on the ascertained knowledge structures. To evaluate <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> menu, participants were timed as they selected target items in <b>the</b> original and <b>redesigned</b> menus. Results indicated that experienced users selected items in <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> menu significantly faster, and preferred <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> menu to <b>the</b> original. Thus, this result demonstrates tangible benefits to organizing menus according to expert knowledge, even when users are familiar with a menu structure. Using methods that follow the general principles presented here will enable designers to uncover expert knowledge and efficiently configure user interfaces, thereby improving trainin...|$|R

[...] To build anticipation for <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> truck, <b>the</b> 1997 model was released in January 1996 with the first ad campaigns airing during Super Bowl XXX. Because of the radical styling, Ford predicted from marketing clinics that traditional truck buyers would not receive the radical and car-like 1997 well, so it continued to produce and sell the previous 1996 model alongside <b>the</b> <b>redesigned</b> 1997 model for a few months.|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, Wolgin began {{development}} of a two-tower high-rise complex in the West Market Street neighborhood of Philadelphia. Existing structures at the site were demolished in 1969 after the city condemned the structures using eminent domain. With the project over budget, Centre Square was redesigned just before construction was scheduled to begin. Originally intended to be two steel high rises, <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> used concrete instead. Unlike similar projects in the city, the entire complex was constructed all at once. The US$80-million Centre Square opened in 1973 with First Pennsylvania Bank as the lead tenant. Centre Square is credited with shifting Philadelphia's downtown office district from South Broad Street to West Market Street.|$|E
5|$|K'inich Popol Hol {{inherited}} {{the throne of}} Copán from K'inich ax K'uk' Mo', who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with <b>the</b> <b>redesign</b> of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K'inich Popol Hol oversaw {{the construction of the}} first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated with images of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.|$|E
