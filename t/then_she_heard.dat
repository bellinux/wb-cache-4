2500|$|The 3–5 minutes bought {{enough time}} that the {{majority}} of the women and children did get away. [...] Rachel Plummer, who was pregnant, was afraid she would not be able to keep up while carrying her two-year-old son, and so she stayed in the fort. [...] She began running after seeing the Indians come into the fort, holding her little boy's hand, while behind her she said she saw Indians stabbing Benjamin with their lances, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> “Uncle Silas shout defiance as though he had a thousand men with him. Alas, he was alone, and soon dead.” [...] Lucy Parker, who also had a small child, stopped to argue with her husband Silas, begging him to come with her. [...] Elizabeth Duty Kellogg stopped to gather up their savings, $100 in coins, before she attempted to escape.|$|E
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> Phonny's voice {{around a}} corner, calling to her.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> {{her name}} spoken, and looked round, to see Eddy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of a verity, no. Let Faquita, <b>then,</b> speak: <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> it." [...] <b>She</b> {{reached out}} her hand, and dragged Maruja's maid, not unwilling, before the old man.|$|R
5000|$|Then {{the story}} goes to Bertha Moore {{who lives in a}} upstairs living flat. She had a baby named Angie. Then the {{telephone}} rings it's Evelyn Merrick. <b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>she</b> hanged up. <b>Then</b> <b>heard</b> a person downstairs <b>then</b> the <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> footsteps it was Evelyn Merrick talking ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Dolores {{had to be}} {{prepared}} to receive any advance from Constance. She looked disgusted at first, and <b>then,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> that Gillian had spoken her mind, said, 'I can't think why you should care.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> {{the voice}} of the Arab as he replied to M. Frecoult.|$|E
60|$|But just <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a buzzing {{overhead}} and two bees alighted on her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> strange wild yelps, staccato, piercing, somehow {{infinitely}} lonely. They {{made her}} shudder.|$|E
60|$|When {{the others}} went off Carrie did not move. The smoke was getting thick, {{the air was}} hot, and now all was quiet <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> {{the roar of the}} fire. She pictured it {{creeping}} through the bush: the flames leaping from branch to branch, the red glow among the trunks that cracked and tottered, and the crash when one fell. Now and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the shock, but it was scarcely distinguishable through the dull roar. The noise was strangely daunting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, Master, {{to me and}} {{my people}} the moon is a goddess who hears prayer and answers it. Suppose, <b>then,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> you and {{answered}} you and came to you and claimed your love, what then?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was that}} in his voice <b>then</b> which <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> when he ordered men.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Wilson {{turned away}} from her to listen. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> rapid beating of hoofs on the road.|$|E
60|$|She felt Oliver Haddo {{take her}} hands. She {{would not let}} him drag them away. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him speak.|$|E
60|$|Margaret shivered. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the boudoir door open, and Janey came out, {{making a}} plucky attempt not to cry.|$|E
60|$|Since <b>then</b> <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> {{nothing from}} Chauvelin. She had {{concluded}} that he had failed, and yet, she had not felt anxious about Armand, because her husband had promised her that Armand would be safe.|$|R
60|$|There {{were more}} {{questions}} and answers, all unintelligible. She pushed her chair {{a little farther}} back, still apparently without awakening their suspicions, and <b>then</b> at last <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> something more definite.|$|R
60|$|The other <b>then</b> said <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> of her {{and that}} she was nursing her child, and <b>she</b> <b>then</b> told Martha to go to the mansion that {{afternoon}} as she had something to say to her.|$|R
60|$|The Queen has linked her siller band About {{her middle}} sma'; And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> her ain gudeman Come rowting through the ha'.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> her father's {{voice behind}} her. The Marquis had stepped out {{on to the}} balcony to {{ascertain}} whether La Boulaye had yet regained consciousness.|$|E
6000|$|Childish perversity {{kept her}} silent. Why couldn't they {{leave her alone}}? They would leave her alone if they knew. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> another kind of knocking, and her father's voice: ...|$|E
60|$|Lydia did {{not know}} when the captain came on board. Once, talking in the cabin made itself felt through her dreams, but the dense sleep of weary youth closed over her again, {{and she did not}} fairly wake till morning. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the crowing of a cock and the cackle of hens, and fancied herself in her room at home; the {{illusion}} passed with a pang. The ship was moving, with a tug at her side, the violent respirations of which were mingled with the sound of the swift rush of the vessels through the water, the noise of feet on the deck, and of orders hoarsely shouted.|$|R
60|$|The girl, still {{frightened and}} {{fearful of the}} man's intentions, did, nevertheless, as he bid. At first she could make out nothing beyond the {{partition}} but a confused murmur of voices, and the clink of glass, as of the touch of the neck of a bottle against a goblet. For a moment she remained in tense silence, her ear pressed to the tiny aperture. <b>Then,</b> distinctly, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> the voice of Skipper Simms.|$|R
50|$|Jones <b>then</b> {{stated that}} <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> Tremble and Edwards discuss {{pricking}} Grace Barnes, and further claimed of Edwards: that the devil carried about Edwards's spirit; that the devil, {{in the form}} of a boy, suckled at her breast; and that the devil had had sex with her four times.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] whispered Suzanne, setting {{her arms}} {{about her in}} a vain attempt to comfort. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> Charlot's voice curtly bidding Guyot to reconduct the Marquise to her carriage.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a voice {{close to}} her saying, 'Well?' and turning she saw before her a {{handsome}} young man, who asked why {{she had come to}} steal his firewood.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> only muttering. Inspector Heat {{must have}} been showing to Mr Verloc the piece of Stevie’s overcoat, because Stevie’s sister, guardian, and {{protector}} heard her husband a little louder.|$|E
60|$|And {{now there}} came {{the sound of}} a heavy body {{brushing}} {{against the side of the}} cabin. She could hear the great padded paws upon the ground outside. For an instant, all was silence; even the bedlam of the forest died to a faint murmur. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> distinctly <b>heard</b> the beast outside sniffing at the door, not two feet from where she crouched. Instinctively the girl shuddered, and shrank closer to the black woman.|$|R
60|$|It was grievous {{to think}} of the {{mischief}} and danger into which Griselda Grantly was brought by the worldliness of her mother in those few weeks previous to Lady Lufton's arrival in town--very grievous, at least, to her ladyship, as from time to time <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> of what was done in London. Lady Hartletop's was not the only objectionable house at which Griselda was allowed to reap fresh fashionable laurels. It had been stated openly in the Morning Post that that young lady had been the most admired among the beautiful at one of Miss Dunstable's celebrated soirées and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> was <b>heard</b> of as gracing the drawing-room at Mrs. Proudie's conversazione.|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating from}} California State University, Fresno, {{she began her}} career as an {{accountant}} at Arthur Young LLP. After graduating from Harvard, Covey briefly joined Wasserstein, Perella in New York as an investment banker before joining a technology company called Digidesign. She helped take the company public and then sold it to another company called Avid, in Boston. In the mid-1990s, Covey moved back to Silicon Valley and interviewed at several promising companies like Excite and Marimba. It was <b>then</b> that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> about Amazon.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Isabel's answer caused {{itself to be}} waited for; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> herself utter it in the stillness that Pansy's {{attention}} seemed to make. [...] "Yes--to marry some one else." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> {{his words}} beneath his voice Somehow, and they {{produced}} pictures that dazzled her. Luminous shadows moved before her eyes, drifting across the gray background of her poor, starved, work-weary life.|$|E
60|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> her mother's voice, and, flitting {{along as}} lightly {{as one of}} the little sea-birds, {{appeared}} before Hester Prynne dancing, laughing, and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her bosom.|$|E
60|$|Judith {{sat down}} in her little rocker and dropped her pointed chin in her hands. Far down the valley, over the firs on the McGregor hill and the blue mirror of the Cranston pond, Bruce Marshall's little gray house peeped out from a {{semicircle}} of white-stemmed birches. She had not seen Bruce since before Christmas. He had been angry at her <b>then</b> because <b>she</b> had refused to let him drive her home from prayer meeting. Since <b>then</b> <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> a rumor {{that he was going}} to see Kitty Leigh at the Upper Valley.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with celebrity columnist Michael Musto of The Village Voice, Brown recalled how Madonna first reacted when saw the film: [...] "At first I <b>heard</b> <b>she</b> really liked it. <b>Then</b> I <b>heard</b> <b>she</b> didn't like the scene where I rolled around on my dog's grave. She'd rolled around on her mother's — like that wasn't offensive enough? <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> didn't like the scene with the dancers suing me, because that really happened to her." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} hours of December 31, 1971, Deuel died at his Hollywood Hills home of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Deuel's girlfriend, Dianne Ray, was at his home {{at the time of his}} death and {{discovered}} his body. Ray later told police the two had watched Deuel's series Alias Smith and Jones the previous evening. She later went to sleep in another room while Deuel stayed up. Sometime after midnight, Deuel entered the bedroom, retrieved his revolver and told Ray [...] "I'll see you later." [...] Ray <b>then</b> said <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a gunshot from another room and discovered Deuel's body.|$|R
