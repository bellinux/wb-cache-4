40|$|Modern economies {{run on the}} {{backbone}} of electricity as one of major factors behind industrial development. India is endowed with plenty {{of natural resources and}} the majority of electricity within the country is generated from thermal and hydro-electric plants. A few nuclear plants assist in meeting the national requirements for electricity but still many rural areas remain uncovered. As India is primarily a rural agrarian economy, providing electricity to the remote, undeveloped regions of the country remains a top priority of the government. A vital, untapped source is livestock generated biomass which to some extent has been utilized to generate electricity in small scale biogas based plants under the government's thrust on rural development. This study is a preliminary attempt to correlate developments in this arena in the Asian region, as well as the developed world, to explore the possibilities of harnessing this resource in a better manner. The current potential of 2600 million tons of livestock dung generated per year, capable of yielding 263, 702 million m 3 of biogas is exploited.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the electricity saving potential of China's power generation industry using the macroeconomic approach. In order to forecast future electricity saving potential, we apply cointegration techniques combined with risk analysis model to estimate future (APRauxiliary power ratio) {{of the national}} power plant. It is found that power structure, technology and AUH (annual utilization hours) of power equipment are all important macro-factors that affect APR. The high proportion of thermal power {{is the main reason}} for the high APR. However, the improvements in technology and AUH help to reduce the APR. Therefore, implementation of the "Replacing Small Units with Large ones" policy and promotion of large-capacity high-parameter units have contributed to electricity conservation in China's power generation industry. With constraints of relevant energy policies, the scenario analysis concludes that electricity saving potential at the power generation side appears more significant and could reach over 40 TWh (<b>terawatt</b> <b>hour)</b> in 2020. Finally, using the results of the scenario analysis, future policy priorities for energy conservation in China's power industry are assessed in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a model of}} price determination to analyze the impacts of increased biofuel production on forest feedstocks markets in Sweden. The model {{is based on a}} spatially-explicit, demand-supply framework. Data on forest biomass supply and harvest cost at the gridcell level is available for Sweden for 334 0. 5 x 0. 5 degree gridcells. We use the data to construct supply curves, both at the national level and sub-national level. The supply and harvest cost data is available for four forest commodities: branch & tops, pulpwood, sawlogs and stumps. The latter are further distinguished {{depending on the type of}} harvest operation: thinning or final felling. On the demand side, the model is calibrated using data on current demand for each feedstock at gridcell level. Demand scenarios for different biofuel targets are generated from the BeWhere-Sweden model at the gridcell level, which allow us to investigate the potential impacts on market price as approximated by the harvest cost data. We run simulation scenarios for increased biofuel production from forest biomass for Sweden: a 10 and 20 <b>terawatt</b> <b>hour</b> (TWh) of biofuel by 2030. As expected, the results show that increased demand pressure on the forest biomass will tend to push prices up. The magnitudes of change are highest for pulpwood and branches & tops from final felling, where they reach 0. 004 % to 18. 95 % and 0. 001 % to 7. 2 % respectively. With respect to the spatial distribution of price change, we notice that it matches expectations as they map out with the spatial distribution of supply and demand...|$|R

Light emitting diodes have emerged as a possible substitute for the conventional light sources and much effort is directed toward improving them. This project presents results on the development and characterization of white-light-emitting chromophores based on the Förster resonance energy transfer between γ-Ga 2 O 3 and organic dyes. 	Several experiments were performed to estimate the average number of Rhodamine B molecules per Ga 2 O 3 nanocrystal. Under standard conditions efficiency of the energy transfer was found to be between 24 - 49 % for the 3. 6 and 5. 3 nm nanocrystals, resulting in the average donor-acceptor separations of 2. 97 and 3. 67 nm, respectively. Data analyses revealed close dependence of the process on the average nanocrystal size. Additional experiments were also conducted with ATTO- 590, displaying similar trends. 	Generation of white light was achieved based on the color complementarity between blue-emitting γ-Ga 2 O 3 nanocrystals and the orange-emitting dye. Additional samples of ZnO with various dyes were also analyzed for color matching. Chromaticity coordinates of (0. 332, 0. 338) and correlated color temperature of 5528 K were obtained in the colloidal state using a 230 nm excitation source. Series of chromophores were applied to the 255 nm and 300 nm ultraviolet diodes. All devices displayed remarkable characteristics with chromaticity coordinates and color temperatures being close to the point of equal energy, and high color rendering indices. The principle of downconverting a narrow UV radiation to visible white light through resonance energy transfer was demonstrated and applied.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The world's {{demand for}} energy {{is an ongoing}} challenge, which {{has yet to be}} overcome. The efforts to find clean energy {{alternatives}} to fossil fuels have been hampered by the lack of investment in technology and research. Among these clean energy alternatives are ocean waves and wind. Wind power is generated through the use of wind generators that harness the wind's kinetic energy; it has gained worldwide popularity as a large-scale energy source, but only provides {{less than one percent of}} global energy consumption. Due to infrastructure limitations on installations of wind turbines at locations where high winds exist, wind energy faces critical challenges difficult to overcome to continue improving electricity generation. Ocean wave energy on the other hand seems like a promising adjunction to wind energy. Ocean energy comes in a variety of forms such as marine currents, tidal currents, geothermal vents and waves. Most of today's research however is based on wave energy. It has been estimated that approximately 257 <b>Terawatt</b> <b>hour</b> per year (TWh/year) could be extracted from ocean waves alone. This amount of energy could be enough to meet the U. S. energy demands of 28 TWh/year. Technologies such as point absorbers, attenuators and overtopping devices are examples of wave energy converters. Point absorbers use a floating structure with components that move relative to each other due to the wave action. The relative motion is used to drive electromechanical or hydraulic energy converters. The total energy throughput of a single point absorber however, does not justify for the great engineering cost and effort by researchers. Thus the need to explore other alternatives of wave conversion that result in no extra-added cost but yet increases throughput. Our research focuses on exploring a novel method to maximize wave energy conversion of an array-based point absorber wave farm. Unlike previous research, our method incorporates a predictive control algorithm to aid the wave farm with the prediction of dynamics and optimal control trajectory over a finite time and space horizon of ocean waves. By using a predictive control algorithm, wave energy conversion throughput can be increased as opposed to a system without. This algorithm requires that the wave characteristics of the incoming wave be provided in advance for appropriate processing. This thesis focuses on designing an efficient and reliable wireless communications system capable of delivering wave information such as speed, height and direction to each point absorber in the network for further processing by the predictive control algorithm. This process takes place in the presence of harsh environmental conditions where the random shape of waves and moving surface can further affect the communication channel. In this work we focus on the physical layer where the transmission of bits over the wireless medium takes place. Specifically we are interested in reducing the bit error rate with a unique relaying protocol to increase packet transmission reliability. We make use of cooperative diversity and existing protocols to achieve our goal of merit and improve end-to-end system performance...|$|R
