5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore.

50|$|Gibson {{believed}} that the environment and animals are not separable items. He stated that without the environment animals cannot survive and without animals there is no environment. The environment is what we perceive at any given moment. All animals are able <b>to</b> <b>perceive.</b> Humans <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> environment directly. This {{is why we are}} unable <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> things in <b>the</b> environment that are too small to see, such as an atom.|$|R
5|$|SpongeBob {{is often}} seen hanging around with his best friend Patrick, who lives on the same street as him. SpongeBob's {{unlimited}} optimistic cheer often leads him <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those around him as happier than they actually are; for instance, he believes that Squidward enjoys his company {{in spite of the}} fact that he clearly loathes him. SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is in a boat. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{inscription}} in {{time and}} its emphasis on bodily changes (through eating, evacuation, and sex), the grotesque has been interpreted by some critics as a dimension {{of the body that}} permits <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> historicity of man: it is in this reading used as a measuring device.|$|E
25|$|In pre-colonial times, {{relations}} between the Terik and the Nandi (their eastern neighbours) were characterized by mutual raids for cattle, land and women, a perspective still alive among old Terik people. However, {{in recent years the}} Terik have increasingly come <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> Nandi as friendly relatives. A number of factors have contributed to this change in perspective.|$|E

The empty place in his heart was filled. Through his studies, he progressed steadfastly on his selected path.|$|E

25|$|During the Interim Peace, the Finns {{gradually}} {{moved closer}} to the Germany to fend of the perceived Soviet aggression and the Soviet interference into the Finnish domestic politics.

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{is the relationship}} between smoking and sensory gating in schizophrenia. Nicotine may help improve auditory gating, the ability to screen out intrusive environmental sounds. This may help improve attention spans and reduce auditory hallucinations, allowing people with schizophrenia <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> environment more effectively and engage in smoother motor functions. However, research shows this effect alone cannot account for increased smoking rates.|$|E

25|$|During mating rituals, {{mantis shrimp}} {{actively}} fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Central Europe Campaign, Allied victory in Europe was inevitable. Having gambled his future ability to defend Germany on the Ardennes offensive and lost, Hitler had no real strength left to stop the powerful Allied armies. The Western Allies still had to fight, often bitterly, for victory. Even when the hopelessness of the German situation became obvious to his most loyal subordinates, Hitler refused to admit defeat. Only when Soviet artillery was falling around his Berlin headquarters bunker did he begin <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> final outcome.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, the School of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi {{taught that}} human reason is able <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> suprasensible. Jacobi {{distinguished}} three faculties: sense, reason, and understanding. Just as sense has immediate {{perception of the}} material so has reason immediate perception of the immaterial, while the understanding brings these perceptions to a person's consciousness and unites them to one another. God's existence, then, cannot be proven (Jacobi, like Immanuel Kant, rejected the absolute value {{of the principle of}} causality), it must be felt by the mind.|$|E

25|$|To these {{dangerous}} {{products of}} Western thought {{he found a}} counterpoise in popular vis inertiae, and in {{the respect of the}} masses for institutions developed slowly and automatically during the past centuries of national life. In his view, human society evolves naturally, just like a tree grows. Human mind is not able <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>the</b> logic of social development. Any attempt to reform society is a violence and a crime. Among the practical deductions drawn from these premises is the necessity of preserving autocratic power, and of fostering among the people the traditional veneration for the ritual of the national Church.|$|E
