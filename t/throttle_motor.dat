40|$|Abstract—Electronic variable-speed drives (VSDs) {{can produce}} large energy and {{environmental}} savings in variable-load variable-speed applications when compared with other conventional tech-nologies. There are {{a very large number}} of applications (e. g., fluid motion, materials handling, and materials processing) which would benefit, both in terms of process improvement and energy savings, through the use of speed control. Previous studies have shown that the variable-flow fluid motion applications (pumps, fans, and compressors) have the largest savings potential. In this paper, an ecodesign analysis of two different technologies for the flow regulation in pumping systems—constant-speed pump with an output <b>throttle</b> valve (<b>motor</b> directly fed from the line) and variable-speed pump without an output <b>throttle</b> valve (<b>motor</b> fed by a variable-speed drive) —is presented. A European standard methodology for the ecodesign analysis of energy-using products is used in this paper. This paper includes a comparative analysis of the environmental impacts and life-cycle costs. The identified large environmental benefits on top of the energy savings provide a strong argument for an increased use of VSDs. The presented analysis is of major importance for industrial electronics manu-facturers, designers, and users, widening their awareness to the importance of taking into account the {{energy and environmental}} issues when evaluating different system design options.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} current {{automotive}} microprocessor technology, with particular emphasis on engine management systems. Electronic and microprocessor control systems are becoming increasingly common in automobiles, as manufacturers seek to extract maximum performance from engines {{while at the same}} ensuring the exhaust emission content remains within legal limits. Microprocessor control systems offer reliability, accuracy and improved vehicle performance, at a low cost. Fuel injection system are of two main types depending on the need for exhaust emission control: memory mapped (open loop), and lambda point (closed loop) for stricter control. To function, these systems require input from a variety of sensors which monitor engine operation and conditions. Engine control is achieved through electro-mechanical actuators such as fuel injectors and <b>throttle</b> plate <b>motors.</b> Microprocessors have revolutionised this field by allowing a previously impossible degree of accuracy and sophistication. Since this field is at the front of automotive technology, research into new techniques for control and sensing will be discussed briefly...|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{high-end}} hobby systems using Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) features {{have come}} on the market that provide a digital bit-stream signal to the receiving device instead of analog type pulse modulation. Advantages include bit error checking capabilities of the data stream (good for signal integrity checking) and fail-safe options including motor (if the model has a <b>motor)</b> <b>throttle</b> down and similar automatic actions based on signal loss. However, those systems that use pulse code modulation generally induce more lag due to lesser frames sent per second as bandwidth is needed for error checking bits. PCM devices can only detect errors and thus hold the last verified position or go into failsafe mode. They cannot correct transmission errors.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two primary}} types of {{throttle}} position sensors (TPS): a potentiometer or a non-contact sensor Hall Effect sensor (magnetic device). A potentiometer is a satisfactory way for non-critical {{applications such as}} volume control on a radio, but as it has a wiper contact rubbing against a resistance element, dirt and wear between the wiper and the resistor can cause erratic readings. The more reliable solution is the magnetic coupling, which makes no physical contact, so will never be subject to failing by wear. This is an insidious failure as it may not provide any symptoms until there is total failure. All cars having a TPS have {{what is known as}} a 'limp-home-mode'. When the car goes into the limp-home-mode it is because the accelerator and engine control computer and the throttle are not talking to each other {{in a way that they}} can understand. The engine control computer shuts down the signal to the <b>throttle</b> position <b>motor</b> and a set of springs in the throttle set it to a fast idle, fast enough to get the transmission in gear but not so fast that driving may be dangerous.|$|R

The inherent safety of hybrid rocket motors offers the potential to greatly reduce overall operating costs. Another key advantage of hybrid rocket motors {{is the potential for}} in-flight shutdown, restart, and throttle by controlling the pressure drop between the oxidizer tank and the injector. This research designed, developed, and ground tested a closed-loop throttle controller for a hybrid rocket motor using nitrous oxide and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene as propellants. The research simultaneously developed closed-loop throttle algorithms and lab scale motor hardware to evaluate the fidelity of the throttle simulations and algorithms. Initial open-loop motor tests were performed to better classify system parameters and to validate motor performance values. Deep-throttle open-loop tests evaluated limits of stable thrust that can be achieved on the test hardware. Open-loop tests demonstrated the ability to <b>throttle</b> the <b>motor</b> to less than 10 % of maximum thrust with little reduction in effective specific impulse and acoustical stability. Following the open-loop development, closed-loop, hardware-in-the-loop tests were performed.

50|$|In {{electric-powered}} models, the powerplant is a battery-powered electric <b>motor.</b> <b>Throttle</b> {{control is}} achieved through an electronic speed control (ESC), which regulates the motor's output. The first electric models were equipped with brushed DC motors and rechargeable packs of nickel cadmium cells (NiCad), giving modest flight times of 5-10 minutes. (A fully fueled glow-engine system of similar weight and power would likely provide double the flight-time.) Later electric systems used more-efficient brushless DC motors and higher-capacity {{nickel metal hydride}} (NiMh) batteries, yielding considerably improved flight times. The recent development of lithium polymer batteries (LiPoly or LiPo) now permits electric flight-times to approach, {{and in many cases}} surpass that of glow-engines - however, the increasing popularity of the much more rugged and durable lithium iron phosphate-celled batteries is increasingly attracting attention away from LiPo packs. There is also solar powered flight, which is becoming practical for R/C hobbyists. In June 2005 a record of 48 hours and 16 minutes was established in California for this class.|$|R
40|$|With fast {{rotating}} permanent-magnet {{motors and}} compact battery storage units, the high performance motorsport community has, in recent years, started {{to utilize the}} quick response and high torque of electrical drivetrain solutions. By recovering energy, braking into a corner, for then to utilize the same energy, boosting out again, the electrical machine gives increased performance even for the fastest racing cars. The purpose of the work presented in this Master s thesis is to develop and produce the power electronics and motor control system needed to control such an electric machine, where the final product is used to drive a fully electric prototype racing car. The thesis presents the conceptual work, design choices, prototyping, testing and development of a 2 -level voltage source inverter and motor control system. The voltage source is a battery accumulator energy storage unit, while the machine is a three-phase permanent-magnet motor. The voltage source inverter is based on insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), controlled by a motor control system called field oriented control. On command from the driver s <b>throttle,</b> the <b>motor</b> control system generates the required stator currents, giving the wanted output torque, supplied from the voltage source of the battery accumulator. The inverter is the connecting interface between the power source, and the rotating machinery. With {{the amount of energy}} and power needed to drive a racing car, safe and reliable operation is important. To ensure the safety of the driver and operating personnel, the system and its safety features have been through extensive testing in a laboratory setup and on the race tracks.

40|$|Abstract — Many {{industrial}} applications require variable flow control of fluid (air, chemical gases, water and liquid chemicals). The traditional method of such flow control {{is to use}} an induction motor at constant speed with 50 -Hz power supply and then control the flow {{by means of a}} <b>throttle.</b> Many fixed-speed <b>motor</b> load applications that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy when they are operated at variable-speed, by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially used in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load’s torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. Also by Using a variable frequency drive to control the fluid flow with a fully open throttle saves a considerable amount of power. As most of the drives operate at part load most of the time, the accumulated energy saving or the corresponding financial benefit, may be substantial over a prolonged period of time. Because this type of fluid flow control is common in industry, widespread application of variable-frequency drives with power electronics area can help in large energy conservation. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} reduce the energy consumption by the implementation of VFD and hence the proper control of fluid flows...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} aerodynamic {{design and}} characterization {{of a new}} quad tilt-wing unmanned aerial vehicle [Sabancı University unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAVI) ] through wind tunnel tests and provides experimental data {{for the design of}} similar aerial platforms. SUAVI is capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and horizontal flight, and it can perform both indoor and outdoor surveillance. Aerodynamic design of the vehicle directly affects its operational performance, including flight stability and flight duration in vertical, transition, and horizontal flight modes. Selection of the propulsion system and determination of the shape of the fuselage and the wings are done in an optimal manner by taking several aerodynamic criteria into account. Flow simulations reveal that the rear wings are affected by the downwash of the front wings. To solve this problem, the rear wings are placed at a higher incidence angle than the front wings. Wind tunnel tests are performed to measure the lift and drag forces and pitching moments for level flight in the entire speed range. Furthermore, the rear and front <b>motor</b> <b>throttle</b> settings and the wing incidence angle combinations for the nominal flight are measured and tabulated. To eliminate undesired spanwise air flows at the wing tips, several winglets with different shapes and sizes are introduced, and the optimum winglet is developed by several simulations and experiments. Some of the results presented in this paper are novel contributions to the literature and can be used in the design of new hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) ...|$|R
50|$|On a {{night flight}} from Boise, Idaho to Pasco, Washington, 22 August 1930 (2:10 a.m.), while over the wooded {{mountains}} of Oregon near Durkee, Oregon, pilot Roy “Abe” Warner suddenly {{became aware of}} the strong smell of gasoline. While choking from the fumes, Warner pointed the nose of the plane toward the emergency field at Baker, Oregon just thirty miles to the east. Warner knew that if he cut the <b>throttle</b> to the <b>motor</b> it would back-fire, turning his airplane into a ball of fire. He almost lost consciousness twice and knew fire was inevitable but it came sooner than he expected. Just four miles from Baker Airport fire broke out! The right wing was nearly burnt through and flames began to creep up the control stick, searing his hand. From an altitude of 7,500 feet he dove his plane and set it down just a quarter mile from the municipal landing field while managing to keep it “right side up”. Quick thinking allowed him to get all fourteen pouches of airmail out of the plane before it was completely engulfed in flames. Fortunately, there were no passengers on this flight and he managed to make it out with just a cut over his right eye from the landing and minor burns to his hand. After being checked out but a physician the mail and Turner left with pilot Joe P Livermore to Pasco with only a slight delay of the scheduled flight.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses the design of a control scheme based on Fuzzy Logic to minimize automobile fuel consumption and exhaust emissions while maximizing battery state of charge (SOC) for hybrid vehicles. The advantages the hybrid vehicle has over the conventional vehicle are very low emission of pollutants, and more efficient fuel consumption if controlled properly. The principal components of the drive train are an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Since there are two devices, it becomes impossible for the driver to individually control both components while driving along, and {{it will be necessary to}} automate the use of these elements so that the vehicle is driven in the same way as a conventional vehicle. In the parallel configuration, both devices apply torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. Each component of the hybrid vehicle is modeled, and <b>throttle</b> angle, <b>motor</b> current and brake torque command are chosen as the control inputs. Another input considered is the driver behavior. This input is obtained from an Artificial Neural Network that classifies the behavior based on the pedal angle characteristics over a period of time. The problem in question is how to distribute the energy demands for each component of the hybrid vehicle so that the objectives, maximizing the battery SOC and minimizing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, are met. Because these objectives depend on different components, we must decide how to demand energy from them to fulfill the driver request and at the same time meeting the objectives. A Fuzzy Logic Controller is designed to meet the driver demand so that the engine, motor and battery are as little exposed as possible to abrupt transitions. Smooth transitions are desired in the engine in order to decrease fuel consumption and emission of pollutants. Smooth transitions in the battery will lead to extended battery life. Simulation results verify that the controller achieves the design objectives. Because the design procedure is based on trial and error, optimality is not guaranteed. Also stability is hard to prove, since there is not much information on this particular issue of Fuzzy Logic...|$|R

This thesis addresses the development of a control scheme to maximize automobile fuel economy and battery state-of-charge (SOC) while meeting exhaust emission standards for parallel hybrid electric vehicles, which are an alternative to conventional passenger vehicles. The principle components of the drive train are a small internal combustion engine and an electric motor, both of them applying torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. Each component of the parallel hybrid vehicle is modeled, and <b>throttle</b> angle, <b>motor</b> current and brake torque command chosen as the control inputs. A performance index describing the total fuel and battery charge used, as well as pollutants emitted over the federal drive cycle, is defined. The problem is to find the optimal control inputs, as a function of time, that minimize the performance index under the chosen drive cycle while satisfying lower and upper bounds on the controls as well as the torque command constraint, derived from the drive cycle speed that the vehicle must follow. The problem is formulated so that optimal control theory can be used by defining the Hamiltonian of the system and deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations. Four special cases for the control bounds which are of practical importance are considered. But, because of the complicated analytical derivatives, solving the general analytical problem is not tractable. The alternate approach that is chosen is a numerical optimization method that solves the constrained optimization problem using the Recursive Quadratic Programming Method. 'To evaluate various control schemes, a set of selected performance measures are studied: only SOC performance, and balanced fuel and SOC performance. Simulations under the federal drive cycle show that we achieve the design objectives while getting better results than with a simple logic controller. The optimum control results suggest that the throttle should always be kept wide open for the SOC to be maximized. This should be accomplished with Buntin's logic controller and would allow us to keep his easy control implementation while improving his performance...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 35). Now-a-days, dealers of natural resources like fuel, coal etc. are facing a hard time {{to keep pace with}} the increasing demand. Therefore, to carry out this demand it is quite necessary to make a new exploration of natural resource of energy and power. Therefore sunlight is now-a-days considered to be a source of energy which is implemented in various day to day applications. Solar energy is being used to produce electricity through sunlight. With the help of this technology we aim to make solar energy powered car in our project. The main component to build a solar car is the solar panel. The solar cells collect a portion of the sun’s energy and store it into the batteries of the solar car. Before that happens, power trackers converts the energy collected from the solar array to the proper system voltage, so that the batteries and the motor can use it. After the energy is stored in the batteries, it is available for use by the motor & motor controller to drive the car. We are going to use two set of batteries; one of which will get the electrical energy from the panel to drive the motor and another will be used as a back-up source of energy which will provide required power when there is no sunlight. A microcontroller can be used in this purpose which can switch to the fully recharged battery when it senses that another battery is empty or not providing enough power to drive the motor. Again, we used a complete circuitry to solve the problem of voltage fluctuation due to movement of the sun, earth or cloud etc. We used a voltage comparator, a relay circuit for and a transistor along with a diode for this purpose. Comparator compares the voltage of solar panel and the battery and then it provides the higher voltage to the transistor to activate the relay which provides the required and stable voltage to the car. However, after all these being proceeded, the motor controller adjusts the amount of energy that flows to the motor to correspond to the <b>throttle.</b> The <b>motor</b> uses that energy to drive the wheels. Preliminarily our objective would be to implement our idea on a remote control toy car and afterwards with help of this prototype we can extend our future work on building a actual car powered by the solar energy.

40|$|The {{conventional}} fixed {{supply pressure}} valve-controlled (FPVC) hydraulic actuation method {{is a simple}} way to obtain motion control of a multi-axis system. The energy dissipated by the relief valve and the control valves is the main cause of the low energy-efficiency (and consequent oil heating) in the system. To overcome this problem, some approaches have been investigated such as load sensing, separate meter-in-and-meter-out, switching control and electro-hydrostatic actuation. In this thesis, a load-prediction based energy-efficient electrohydraulic actuation system – variable supply pressure valve-controlled (VPVC) actuation is described and implemented. A two-axis robotic arm is used as an example plant. In this research, the VPVC hydraulic actuation system is implemented by a fixed capacity pump driven by a brushless servo-motor. The feed forward part of the VPVC controller predicts the minimum required supply pressure for the demanded motion to each joint of the robotic arm by assuming its control valve is fully open. It is based on the prediction of the required piston force for a given motion demand, by applying Lagrange's equations of the-second-kind. The supply pressure for the whole system is the higher one of the two load branches; the other one is controlled by the common valve throttling. The supply flow is varied by controlling the speed of the servomotor. The feedback control of the VPVC is simple PI control for the valves and P control for the motor speed. Although the VPVC method is demonstrated for a two axis system, it is applicable to systems with any number of axes. By using the variable minimum required supply pressure together with the maximum valve opening (and hence minimum throttling losses), the hydraulic energy-efficiency is improved compared with a fixed supply pressure valve-controlled (FPVC) system. Moreover, due to the feed forward control, the response has much less phase lag hence the dynamic error is much smaller than a conventional FPVC system with proportional integral position feedback control. Applied to a known plant, especially enough load information, VPVC provides a higher energy-efficiency and a higher accuracy of motion control. The simulation and experimental results have validated the advantages of the VPVC over the FPVC. The hydraulic power consumption comparison between VPVC and FPVC with the same sine wave motion demand showed that up to 70 % saving was achieved by VPVC experimentally. If the energy loss via relief valve in FPVC is taken into account, the saving can be increased greatly. The experiment also showed that the VPVC brought a very quiet operating due to the minimum flow <b>throttling</b> and variable <b>motor</b> speed, whereas serious flow throttling and constant high speed of motor in FPVC. Very low noise is another significant benefit of VPVC over FPVC. All the dynamic errors in VPVC tests were smaller than in FPVC. They were within 6 % of the total motion range, compared to 14 % for FPVC. And the average dynamic errors of VPVC tests were within 1. 5 % of the total motion range...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} project was to create an autonomous drone with the capability to pick up, and deliver an object, without any human interference. This is an continuation of the work done during the pre-project. The obectives during this project were: 1. Improve the orientation controller 2. Implement a position controller with necessary sensors 3. Implement a method for the drone to recognize objects to be picked up, and lock on to the object 4. Implement a method for picking up an object 5. Do an overall test of all the objectives mentioned above 6. If there is enough time a collision detector system should be implemented. Before the orientation controller could be improved {{it was necessary to}} revise the orientation data processing algorithms. After implementing a calibration routine, <b>motor</b> <b>throttle</b> compensation, rollover compensation and acceptance test for the compass, and a tilt compensation function for the gyroscope, the results were satisfying. An LQR controller and cascade controller was tested in order to find the best alternative for controlling the drone's orientation. Both controllers were tested and tuned against the drone model in Simulink before implemented on the drone's MCU for further testing and tuning. The cascade configuration was precise and responsive, and proved to be the superior controller design for this use. With this, the first objective was met. In order for the drone to be implemented with a position controller the following new hardware was installed. 1. GNSS receiver, for measuring position and velocity 2. Pressure sensor, for accurately measuring altitude 3. Vision sensor, for detecting objects 4. IR sensor, for detecting the ground In order to get a visual feedback of the current status of the drone, LED's were installed. Appropriate drivers were developed for the new peripheral devices. Because of the new hardware a new PCB design was necessary, the new design made the electronics more concealed, and the drone more compact. A hook connected to a servo was suggested as a method for picking up objects, but was not implemented due to controller issues. In order for the visual representation of the drone's position and -velocity to be easy to comprehend the GNSS data was converted to ENU coordinates, and pressure sensor data was recalculated to altitude. Sensor fusion with kalman filtering was implemented to filter the velocity data, and a second order low-pass filter was used to filter the altitude data, this gave noise reduced measurements. The controller design used for positioning was a cascade controller, and was tuned and tested {{in the same manner as}} the orientation controller. The tuning of the position controller had to be done outside, but due to harsh weather conditions, not enough time was spent on tuning the controller, the parameters were therefore not optimal. The overall controller design and implementation worked as planned, with this, the second objective was met. The raw data from the vision sensor, object $x$- and $y$ position and object width, was recalculated to a three dimensional position vector, so the object position data could be used in the position controller. To make testing easier, the vision sensor was also modeled in Simulink. The flight controller combines all the controller and data processing modules plus necessary logic for the modules to cooperate. This was designed in Simulink because of the possibility to simulate against the drone model. Four flight modes were implemented in the flight controller, 1. Manual mode, 2. Manual GNSS mode, 3. Autonomous mode, and 4. Autonomous object mode. A battery monitoring system was also implemented for warning the user of low battery via the LED's. A real-time operating system was implemented due the need for doing several operations at the same time, and some modules having a strict execution deadline. There was implemented a total of seven tasks and one interrupt routine. The operating system worked flawlessly. All modes except "autonomous object mode" were tested on the physical drone, though the functionality of all three modes worked as expected there was definitively room for improvements. When testing "manual mode" an issue arose, when given a roll- or pitch input the drone was not able to hold its attitude over time, and would flatten out as it picked up speed. This affected the drone's top speed, which was noticeable on the performance in "autonomous mode" and "manual GNSS mode", this issue affected the drone's ability to hold its geographic position, and move to another position. The root cause of this issue was tough to be poor controller parameters. Because of this issue there was no point in implementing the "autonomous object mode" on the drone, this was rather simulated in Simulink, and the result was satisfying enough to suggest the mode to be implemented on a later moment. Due to the issues mentioned above, the "autonomous object mode" was never implemented on the drone, there was no point in implementing this mode as the position controller was not precise enough. With this, the third and fourth objective was not met, although much of the work has been done. A test of all the implemented objectives was done, the fifth objective was therefore met. There was no time to complete objective six...|$|R
