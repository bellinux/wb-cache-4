5|$|Back at the Alley, Sing {{undergoes}} a transformation {{brought on by}} the Beast's attack, fully healing himself and making him a kung-fu master himself. He sees <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the Landlords as the Gang arrives. Sing easily defeats the Gang and faces the Beast alone. The Beast uses his Toad style maneuvers to launch Sing high into the air. While aloft, Sing comes to peace with Buddha, and is able to use the Buddhist Palm method to subdue the Beast. The Beast accepts his defeat and asks Sing to be his master.|$|E
5|$|Years {{of civil}} war had left Rome {{in a state of}} near lawlessness, but the Republic was not {{prepared}} to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.|$|E

25|$|Birdwatchers {{may take}} part in censuses of bird populations and migratory {{patterns}} which are sometimes specific to individual species. These birdwatchers may also count all birds in a given area, as in the Christmas Bird Count or follow carefully designed study protocols. This kind of citizen science can assist in identifying environmental threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of birds or, conversely, in assessing outcomes of environmental management initiatives intended to ensure the survival of at-risk species or encourage the breeding of species for aesthetic or ecological reasons.|$|E
25|$|Since E. imperialis is not {{a social}} bee and lacks a worker cast, the nest is {{constructed}} communally.

25|$|The {{bodies of}} water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. One sign of high {{productivity}} and growth rate in the oceans {{is the level of}} algae. Increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the food chain.|$|E
25|$|Collier {{believed}} that the general allotments of Indian Reservation land was a complete failure {{that led to the}} increasing loss of Native American land. He emerged as a federal Indian policy reformer in 1922, and strongly criticized the BIA policies and implementation of the Dawes Act. Prior to Collier, criticism of BIA had been directed at corrupt and incompetent officials rather than the policies. For the next decade, Collier fought against legislation and policies that were detrimental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of Native Americans and was associated with the American Indian Defense Association, serving as executive secretary until 1933.|$|E
25|$|In 1386 John left England to {{seek the}} throne of Castile, claimed in Jure uxoris by right of his second wife, Constance of Castile, whom he had married in 1371. However, crisis ensued almost {{immediately}} in his absence, and in 1387 King Richard's misrule brought England {{to the brink of}} civil war. Only John, on his return to England in 1389, succeeded in persuading the Lords Appellant and King Richard to compromise to usher in a period of relative stability. During the 1390s, John's reputation of devotion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the kingdom was largely restored.|$|E

25|$|Because Trinidad and Tobago {{lie on the}} {{continental}} shelf of South America, their biological diversity is unlike that of most other Caribbean islands, and has {{much in common with}} that of Venezuela. The main ecosystems are: coastal and marine (coral reefs, mangrove swamps, open ocean and seagrass beds); forest; freshwater (rivers and streams); karst; man-made ecosystems (agricultural land, freshwater dams, secondary forest); and savanna. On 1 August 1996, Trinidad and Tobago ratified the 1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, and it has produced a biodiversity action plan and four reports describing the country's contribution to biodiversity conservation. The reports formally acknowledged the importance of biodiversity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the country's people through provision of ecosystem services.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between measuring and improving software quality in an embedded system (with emphasis on risk management) and software quality in business software (with emphasis on cost and maintainability management) is becoming somewhat irrelevant. Embedded systems now often include a user interface and their designers are as much concerned with issues affecting usability and user productivity as their counterparts who focus on business applications. The latter are in turn looking at ERP or CRM system as a corporate nervous system whose uptime and performance are vital <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the enterprise. This convergence is most visible in mobile computing: a user who accesses an ERP application on their smartphone is depending {{on the quality of}} software across all types of software layers.|$|E
25|$|Like all Corydoras species, {{the fish}} feeds {{primarily}} upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, {{that the traditional}} use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of this species—it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), Daphnia, cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter.|$|E
