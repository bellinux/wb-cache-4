5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, King Kamehameha IV declared the Kingdom of Hawaii's neutrality on August26, 1861. Despite this stance of neutrality, many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands acted independently and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiian participation in American wars was not unheard of; Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more fought during the American Civil War. There were varying reasons for joining the war. Hawaiians abroad often sought economic gains and adventures through their enlistment. These included the unemployed sailors on whaling ships who joined the Union Navy and sailors on whaling ships captured by the Confederate Navy who served on the CSS Shenandoah. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> ideological sympathy for the cause of the war. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to New England through missionaries and the whaling industry, and the opposition of many people in the islands to slavery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 {{in response to}} Macleod's financial mismanagement of the force. For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest {{in the management of}} the force, and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E

By the early morning of 28 November, all sites except for the Taj Hotel had been secured by Mumbai Police Department and security forces.

5|$|In Tokelau, many of {{the local}} {{officials}} feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other debris in the ocean and across the island. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> increase of mosquitoes and other insects, increasing {{the threat of a}} dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged {{many of the}} hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.|$|E

Shortly after the win, {{defensive}} coordinator Bill Belichick left to become head coach of the Cleveland Browns, and Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> ownership change in what had been one of the most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, after being diagnosed with Cancer, Tim Mara sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million.

5|$|Within {{the realm}} of tie-in {{speculative}} fiction, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> increase in LGBT representation. In particular, from 2001 onwards there was {{a concerted effort to}} explore this in licensed Star Trek literature. In the , the post-series novels following the end of the eponymous television series, a passing line in one series to a certain species, the Andorians, marrying in fours allowed the exploration of a quatri-gendered species, who partnered in broadly two 'male' and two 'female' species. Andrew J. Robinson's Garak novel, A Stitch in Time, suggested the omnisexuality of his character, which was followed up in subsequent novels, in particular Una McCormack's 2014 novel, The Crimson Shadow. In the original series , created by Marco Palmieri and David Alan Mack, two of the main characters were a lesbian Vulcan officer and a lesbian Klingon intelligence agent.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>an</b> increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house.
