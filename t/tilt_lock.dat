50|$|Trim is {{the angle}} of the motor in {{relation}} to the hull, as illustrated below. The ideal trim angle is the one in which the boat rides level, with most of the hull on the surface instead of plowing through the water.If the motor is trimmed out too far, the bow will ride too high in the water. With too little trim, the bow rides too low. The optimal trim setting will vary depending on many factors including speed, hull design, weight and balance, and conditions on the water (wind and waves). Many large outboards are equipped with power trim, an electric motor on the mounting bracket, with a switch at the helm that enables the operator to adjust the trim angle on the fly. In this case, the motor should be trimmed fully in to start, and trimmed out (with an eye on the tachometer) as the boat gains momentum, until it reaches the point just before ventilation begins or further trim adjustment results in an RPM increase with no increase in speed. Motors not equipped with power trim are manually adjustable using a pin called a topper <b>tilt</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock</b> is an {{innovative}} solution for locations where road traffic crosses marine traffic overhead by a bridge. The occurrence of traffic jams at a bridge during {{the passage of}} vessels can be reduced by {{the construction of a}} <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock.</b> By 'submerging' the vessels in the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock</b> underneath the bridge, the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock</b> increases the available air draft for vessels. Due to the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock,</b> vessels can pass a fixed bridge span underneath without hindrance for the road traffic on top of the bridge. The main challenge of the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock</b> is the large depth that is required for the implementation of the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock.</b> Due to the circular shape of the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock,</b> excavations are required up to 30 meter below the current bottom surface of the Haringvliet estuary. These large excavations will interfere with the pile foundation of the Haringvliet bridge piers. In the case study, the feasibility of the excavations that are required for the <b>Tilting</b> <b>Lock</b> was evaluated.

50|$|The Model 1905 used a short recoil {{action with}} a <b>tilting</b> <b>locking</b> block. This was same {{principle}} Mannlicher {{used in his}} 1901 pistol-caliber carbine. However, for the rifle he scaled it up to 8mm Mauser, the standard German military rifle cartridge. The rifle also used a Schönauer rotary magazine, and sights copied from the Mauser Gewehr 98. Although his company patented the design in 1905, Mannlicher's death in 1904 ended any further development of the design.|$|R
5000|$|The Vektor SP1 is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistol. It uses a Walther-type <b>tilting</b> <b>locking</b> piece, located {{below the}} straight-recoiling barrel, to lock {{it to the}} slide. The frame is made from {{aluminium}} alloy, other parts are steel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted, ambidextrous safety that allows for [...] "cocked and locked" [...] carry. Sights are fixed; the front sight is pinned to the slide, the rear is dovetailed. Magazines are double stack; the magazine release button {{is located at the}} base of trigger-guard.|$|R
50|$|The APX {{design is}} a major {{departure}} from the M9. The M9 uses a P38-style locked breech short recoil system, but {{this has not been}} carried over to the APX. The APX, instead, uses the system pioneered on the SIG Sauer P220; instead of a <b>tilting</b> <b>locking</b> block, as in the M9, the breech is now locked by the breech block being cammed into engagement with the slide, {{in the same manner as}} was first seen on the SIG Sauer P220. The core of the system is a stainless steel chassis which allows true modular reconfiguration.|$|R
50|$|The P9RC is the {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the P9R. There are 3 notable differences: the guide rod assembly, the bottom part of the barrel (on which the <b>tilting</b> barrel <b>locking</b> system works) and the grips. Earlier P9Rs had wooden grips, later ones came with plastics as well, while P9RCs were made with plastics only.|$|R
5000|$|... "Prvi Hrvatski Pištolj" [...] {{stands for}} [...] "first Croatian pistol" [...] and was {{manufactured}} by IM Metallic, today known as HS Produkt. The pistol was hastily developed {{to supply the}} Croatian military soon after Croatia gained its independence from Yugoslavia, but it was soon after replaced by the HS 2000. By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols, and takes several design influences that are in both handguns, such as a decocker/safety, double-action/single-action trigger, open-top slide and vertically <b>tilting</b> <b>locking</b> block. The overall appearance of the pistol mostly resembles the P38, but the magazine capacity and single recoil spring below the barrel is closer to a Beretta. The safety also incorporates a manual decocking lever, located {{on the left side}} of the grip frame. It is entirely possible that the safety/decocker was based off of the design of the Beretta Cheetah.|$|R
5000|$|The Vickers K was a {{development}} of the Vickers-Berthier (VB) light machine gun, adopted in 1932 by the Indian Army. The VB, like the Bren light machine gun, used a <b>tilting</b> <b>locking</b> breechblock. However, unlike the Bren, the VB locked its breech only {{at the last moment}} of forward travel and this enabled the {{development of the}} Vickers K also known as the [...] "Vickers Gas Operated" [...] (VGO) or [...] "Vickers GO" [...] With lighter moving parts and the VB locking design, the Vickers K had an adjustable rate of fire between 950 and 1,200 rounds per minute; faster than the German MG34. The weapon was adopted for British service as the VGO. It was test-flown with a large 300-round pan magazine, and beat the [...]303 Browning in reliability. However, the wide pan would have caused problems to accommodate, since it would have interfered with wing structures. When the belt-fed Browning Mark II was selected as the standard machine-gun armament for RAF aircraft, the VGO became redundant for the RAF. It continued to be used by the Fleet Air Arm until 1945.|$|R
50|$|The Turbo's {{final run}} was on October 31, 1982, {{when they were}} {{replaced}} by the all-Canadian LRC trainsets from Bombardier Transportation, which employed conventional diesel-electric locomotives. Although they had an early reputation for unreliability, according to CN's records, the rebuilt TurboTrains had an availability rate of over 97% for their careers with CN and Via. The LRC suffered from similar teething problems, notably with the <b>tilt</b> system <b>locking</b> the cars in a tilted position.|$|R
50|$|Base (1995-2001): The {{most popular}} Lumina, the base model came well {{equipped}} for its price point. It had standard front row bench seat which upped seating to six, power <b>locks,</b> <b>tilt</b> steering wheel, dual airbags, and air conditioning. Base models were equipped with fifteen-inch steel wheels with wheel covers.|$|R
5000|$|Tilting can be {{actively}} controlled by applying force between the paired wheels. A [...] "free leaner" [...] is balanced by steering, like a single track vehicle. This still leaves some advantages in traction, and the <b>tilt</b> can be <b>locked</b> for parking {{faster than a}} stand can be deployed.|$|R
50|$|The Vinten Mk 3 Pan & Tilt head used risers and cams to {{maintain}} the centre of gravity. This made the tilting of heavy cameras considerably easier and if correctly mounted a camera could be left at any <b>tilt</b> angle without <b>lock</b> off. The design (by William Vinten's son Bill) was highly innovative for the time.|$|R
40|$|An autonomous, {{efficient}} and effective object tracking algorithm was required to autonomously identify and track incoming targets. Then controlling a pan-tilt mounted with the sensing camera to accommodate the target within the camera's field of view and controlling a weapon mounted on the second mechanical pan <b>tilt</b> to <b>lock</b> the target and follow it efficiently and accurately. A hybrid algorithm is derived that {{is a combination of}} an intruder identification and localization technique derived from the normalized cross correlation method. Spatial and dimensional parameters of the target are autonomously retrieved from segmented correlation method, which are then used as the input parameters for the mean shift algorithm...|$|R
5000|$|WIST-94 was {{designed}} at Military Institute of Armament Technology (WITU) under the code name Piryt (pl.Pyrite) [...] Two prototypes {{were made in}} 1992, which differ in the barrel locking system: Model A01 used a rotary-locking system and Model B01 using conventional, Browning-type <b>tilting</b> barrel <b>locking.</b> B01 {{was the only one}} to complete testing but the development was temporarily halted due to the military cutting off funding. Financed by WITU and Prexer company, the project continued and in 1994 a new prototype was developed. Called WIST-94 {{it is based on the}} B01 prototype. The new pistol was chosen by the Polish military as its new standard sidearm.|$|R
50|$|CrossCountry's Class 221s operate {{alongside}} 220s on {{the routes}} inherited from Virgin CrossCountry. Since these routes are not cleared for tilting operation (with {{the exception of}} Wolverhampton to Stockport), in 2008 the <b>tilting</b> equipment was <b>locked</b> out of use and shortly afterwards was isolated altogether, replacing the hydraulic rams with fixed tie-bars. This change was made to improve reliability and reduce maintenance costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} opening, emptying, and loading the Webley-Fosbery is {{identical}} to all other contemporary Webley revolvers. A pivoting lever {{on the side of}} the upper receiver is pressed to release the cylinder-barrel section, which tilts up and forward ("breaks") on a bottom-front pivot, simultaneously ejecting the contents of the cylinder chambers. Once loaded the section is <b>tilted</b> back to <b>lock</b> closed.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{features}} {{depending on}} market include: sixteen inch alloy wheels, AM/FM/CD player/Sirius Satellite Radio/MP3 Capability, iPod auxiliary jack, air conditioning, power windows and door locks, front/side/full length Side curtain airbags, four wheel disc brakes, ABS, electronic stability control, tire pressure monitoring system, LATCH, child safety door <b>locks,</b> <b>tilt</b> steering column, {{front and rear}} twelve volt outlets, front and rear Cupholders.|$|R
50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to propel a gas piston rod {{connected}} to the locking assembly (it uses a long-stroke piston system). The barrel breech is locked with a vertically <b>tilting,</b> downward <b>locking</b> lever mechanism that is {{connected to the}} bolt carrier through an articulated joint. The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the locking lever are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|R
50|$|The vz. 52 was {{originally}} called the ZB 501, and {{was designed by}} Václav Holek. It is gas-operated and uses a <b>tilting</b> bolt that <b>locks</b> into {{the roof of the}} receiver. Its overall action is based on the Czech ZB-26 light machine gun. It has an integral bipod and interchangeable barrels, and its feed system is designed to take metallic belts or box magazines interchangeably and without any modifications.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the {{interior}} again saw major changes as the dashboard of the LTD Crown Victoria was redesigned. Nearly {{identical to that}} of the Grand Marquis, the new interior features a driver-side airbag as standard equipment. To streamline production costs and increase its appeal after 11 years, the standard equipment list of the LTD Crown Victoria added many previously optional features, including air conditioning (made standard in 1987), power windows, <b>locks,</b> <b>tilt</b> steering, and automatic headlights (AutoLamp).|$|R
50|$|The MAS direct {{impingement}} design {{reduced the}} number of bolt moving parts to only six: the bolt carrier, then the rear <b>locking</b> <b>tilting</b> bolt which carries the extractor, the ejector and the firing pin, and lastly the recoil spring. It takes only a few seconds to disassemble the entire bolt mechanism for cleaning. The MAS-49 had a reputation for reliability in conditions of poor maintenance, sometimes being cleaned with nothing more than rags and motor oil. The rifle could also endure harsh service environments (MAS rifles saw service in Algeria, Djibouti, Indochina, and French Guiana).|$|R
50|$|The M1895 used a <b>tilting</b> bolt to <b>lock</b> into {{position}} when firing, {{the first example}} of such in a machine gun design. The bolt slid forward and rearward within a slot in the receiver area, held forward by a spring inside the tube that also held the operator's grip handle. As it moved forward the bolt eventually met the barrel. At that point a cam below the bolt dropped into a hole which allowed {{the rear of the}} bolt to tilt downward, seating it against the rear of the breech and locking it in position. The bolt remained locked when the round was fired.|$|R
50|$|The Kk 62 is a gas-operated, belt-fed {{automatic}} weapon. It uses a <b>tilting</b> bolt that <b>locks</b> {{into the}} roof of the receiver, and fires from an open bolt. The overall system of operation is modeled on that found in the Czech vz. 52 machine gun. The Kk 62's receiver is machined from steel, and a tubular metal buttstock houses the recoil spring. The Kk 62 is fed from the right-hand side, from 100-round belts that are carried in pouches that clamp onto the receiver wall. The Kk 62 has no quick-change barrel, which is a serious drawback when sustained firepower is required; the original usage doctrine was based on agile hit-and-run tactics rather than suppressive fire from a strong position. The cleaning rod is attached to right side of the butt and receiver. A side-folding carrying handle is provided in front of the feeding mechanism. The Kk 62 is also equipped with a folding bipod.|$|R
5000|$|At the 2007 SHOT Show held in Orlando, Florida, Kel-Tec {{introduced}} {{a series of}} new [...] "High-Efficiency Rifles" [...] called the RFB, standing for [...] "Rifle, Forward-ejection, Bull-pup." [...] The RFB is a gas-operated semi-automatic rifle with <b>tilting</b> breech block <b>locking</b> mechanism, loads the 7.62×51 NATO cartridge and uses metric FAL magazines; the RFB [...] "family" [...] consists {{in a series of}} Bullpup rifles with three barrel lengths (18" [...] barrel carbine, 24" [...] sporter and 32" [...] target versions), and a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. This eliminates a major drawback of Bull-pup rifles, which is that they may not be readily usable by left-handed shooters. Distribution of the RFB rifles in the USA was scheduled for February 2009; as of 2013, it has been publicly released for sale. As a further Revolution of the Bullpup, the RDB (Rifle Downward-ejecting Bullpup) was released in late 2015.|$|R
50|$|The FAL {{operates}} {{by means}} of a gas-operated action very {{similar to that of the}} Russian SVT-40. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the barrel, and the locking mechanism is what is known as a <b>tilting</b> breechblock. To <b>lock,</b> it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy receiver much like the bolts of the Russian SKS carbine and French MAS-49 series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of rifle grenades and manual operation. The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed stock versions of the FAL, the recoil spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.|$|R
5000|$|The Strike One uses a Bergmann System {{introduced}} in the Bergmann-Bayard pistol. Unlike the Browning system, the barrel does not <b>tilt.</b> It is <b>locked</b> with a Y shaped part that during the recoil locks the barrel and bolt and halfway through it drops, releasing the barrel. The barrel stops its motion, the bolt continues back, ejecting the spent cartridge case and loading fresh cartridge and on its way back the Y shaped locking fork reengages and the barrel and bolt move together forward. Instead of tilting the barrel only moves in a straight line, thus increasing the accuracy. The Strike one is rated for +P+ ammunition and specifically set up to fire Russian 9×19mm ammunition 7N21 and 7N31 which are close to [...]357 SIG in their performance. The pistol will be available in: 9×19mm Parabellum, 9×21mm IMI, [...]357 SIG, and [...]40 S&W. There is no discussion for 10mm Auto or [...]45 ACP versions, although a [...]38 Super version is being considered due to this cartridge's popularity in Italy in particular (Italian laws forbid civilians to have weapons in the same caliber as military and police). A fully automatic version of the Strike One has been offered for the Russian Armed Forces. Longer barreled version (300mm) is also available.|$|R
