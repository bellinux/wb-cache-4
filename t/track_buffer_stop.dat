5000|$|... 1965 — Staines West {{railway station}} closed. The station {{building}} survives intact and is Grade II listed. A section of <b>track</b> and <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> survive. The platform area {{is now part}} of a car park.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} one island {{platform}} with two <b>tracks,</b> ending with <b>buffer</b> <b>stops.</b> In former times, these tracks merged {{to enter a}} facility for loading and unloading narrow-gauge trucks with material for and from the construction of dams in the Kurobe River gorge.|$|R
50|$|After the {{building}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, no trains ran to the south from Lichtenrade and the station became a terminus. The level crossing barriers were dismantled, but the access tunnel retained its function. The two <b>tracks</b> ended at <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> in front of Bahnhofstrasse. The Lrd signalbox at the northern end of the station was shut down in 1977-78 and only one platform track was used from then on.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shop was}} {{completely}} destroyed as was a roundabout behind the shop. The train stopped some 40 metres past {{the end of}} the <b>track</b> and the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop.</b> Initial investigation showed that {{the end of the}} track in this location was not marked with a light but only with some unlit signs. Also the (Dutch) train driver was a temporary worker and it might be that he did not know the local situation of the tracks.Circumstances that might have contributed to the accident: ...|$|R
50|$|The Isar Valley Railway opened from Thalkirchen to Ebenhausen on 10 June 1891 {{and it was}} {{extended}} to Wolfratshausen on 27 July. From the beginning there was a railway station in Ebenhausen, which {{was known as the}} Isartalbahnhof (station of the Valley Railway Railway) because it was served by trains running on the Valley Railway Railway. The station had three tracks at the opening of line. In addition, two <b>tracks</b> running to <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> also existed, which were designed primarily for freight. The station building was built in the renaissance revival style and it is now a listed building. The building has of pavilions on both sides, which are connected by a waiting room.|$|R

5000|$|... 1902 - Frankfurt am Main, Germany - Serious <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> {{collision}} inspires {{development of}} Rawie range of energy-absorbing <b>buffer</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R
40|$|Friction <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> are the favoured {{construction}} of <b>buffer</b> <b>stop,</b> mainly {{due to its}} high resistance and variety of layout. Last but not least is its manner of deceleration induced upon impact and during the braking what makes it smart solution in railway transport safety. The general approach of designing <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> is via usage of the kinetic energy and its conversion into work. Paper describes input parameters such as train velocity or <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> vicinity which is expressed by the safety coefficient implanted within the calculation. Furthermore, the paper shows the principle of calculation the friction <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> work, or to be more precise, the work of its braking jaws and optionally the work of additional braking jaws located behind the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop.</b> Last section of the paper {{is focused on the}} examples of designing friction <b>buffer</b> <b>stops,</b> points out the main complications and shows the charts of relation amongst braking distance, kinetic energy and braking force and the charts of relation between deceleration rate and braking distance...|$|R
50|$|Largely {{because of}} its mass, a train {{transfers}} {{an enormous amount of}} kinetic energy in a collision with a <b>buffer</b> <b>stop.</b> Rigid <b>buffers</b> can only safely cope with very low-speed impacts (i.e., nearly stationary). To improve stopping performance, a way of dissipating this energy is needed, through compression or friction. Following a <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> accident at Frankfurt am Main in 1902, the Rawie company developed a large range of energy-absorbing <b>buffer</b> <b>stops.</b> Similar hydraulic <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> were developed by Ransomes & Rapier in the UK.|$|R
40|$|Paper discuses {{reasons of}} {{building}} <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> and situations {{that may occur}} in railway station leading to build safety tracks. Also discusses parameters of <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> that enter its design, such as collision speed and kinetic energy absorbing capacity. Furthermore, presents categories of <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> depending on principles of absorbing the kinetic energy and points {{pros and cons of}} each structure...|$|R
50|$|A {{track circuit}} {{interrupter}} may be fitted behind a friction <b>buffer</b> <b>stop.</b> In {{the event of}} the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> being struck by a train and pushed along, an adjacent line may potentially be fouled. Breaking the interrupter causes the adjacent track circuit to show 'occupied' until the interrupter is replaced.|$|R
50|$|Dead-end sidings {{are often}} fitted with <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> to prevent {{vehicles}} running {{off the end}} of the track. These may consist of a simple transverse beam fixed at buffer height but the <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> at passenger stations can be elaborate hydraulic installations capable of absorbing a considerable amount of energy.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design of}} the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> is dependent, in part, {{on the kind of}} {{couplings}} that the railway uses, since the coupling gear is {{the first part of the}} vehicle that the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> touches. The term [...] "buffer stop" [...] is of British origin, since railways in Great Britain principally use buffer-and-screw couplings between vehicles.|$|R

50|$|In some instances, due to {{low line}} speeds, an OSS {{may not be}} fitted.An OSS on its own {{may be used to}} protect a {{permanent}} speed restriction, a signal at danger, or <b>buffer</b> <b>stop.</b> Although loops are standard, <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> may be fitted with 'mini loops', due to the very low approach speed, usually 10 mph. When <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> were originally fitted with TPWS using standard loops there were many instances of false applications, causing delays whilst it reset, with trains potentially blocking the station throat, plus the risk of passengers standing to alight being thrown over by the sudden braking. This problem arose when a train passed over the arming loop so slowly that it was still detected by the train's receiver after the on-board timer had completed its cycle. The timer would reset and begin timing again, and the trigger loop then being detected within this second timing cycle would lead to a false intervention. As a temporary solution, drivers were instructed to pass the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> OSSs at 5 mph, eliminating the problem, but meaning that trains no longer had the momentum to roll to the normal stopping point and requiring drivers to apply power beyond the OSS, just a short distance from the buffers, arguably making a <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> collision more likely than before TPWS was fitted. The redesigned 'mini loops', roughly a third the length of the standard ones, eliminate this problem, although due to the low speed and low margin, <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> OSSs are still a major cause of TPWS trips.|$|R
