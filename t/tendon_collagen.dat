40|$|The {{reason why}} women sustain more soft tissue injury than men during {{physical}} activity is unknown. Connective tissue properties and extracellular matrix adaptability in human tendon were investigated in models that addressed biochemical, physiological and biomechanical aspects of tendon connective tissue {{in response to}} mechanical loading. Habitual training resulted in a larger patellar tendon in men but not in women. Following an acute bout of exercise, men had an elevated <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis rate and this effect was less pronounced or absent in women. Moreover, levels of circulating oestrogen affected the acute exercise-related increase in collagen synthesis. Finally, the mechanical strength of isolated <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> fascicles in men surpassed that of women. Thus, compared to men, women have (i) an attenuated tendon hypertrophy response to habitual training; (ii) a lower <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis rate following acute exercise; (iii) a rate of <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis which is further attenuated with elevated estradiol levels; and (iv) a lower mechanical strength of their tendons. These data indicate that tendons in women have a lower rate of new connective tissue formation, respond less to mechanical loading, and have a lower mechanical strength, which may leave the tissue more susceptible to injury...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Lyme Borreliosis, or Lyme’s disease, {{manifests itself}} in {{numerous}} skin conditions. Therapeutic intervention should be initiated {{as soon as a}} clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans is made. The histopathology of some of the skin conditions associated with Lyme Borreliosis is characterised by structural changes to collagen, and sometimes also elastic fibres. These conditions include morphea, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. More recently, further skin conditions have been identified by the new microscopic investigation technique of focus floating mi-croscopy: granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, erythema annulare centrifugum, inter-stitial granulomatous dermatitis, cutaneous sarcoidosis and lymphocytic infiltration; these conditions also sometimes cause changes in the connective tissue. In the case of ligaments and <b>tendons,</b> <b>collagen</b> and elastic fibres predominate struc-turally. They are also the structures that are targeted by Borrelia. The resultant functional disorders have previously only rarely been associated with Borreliosis in clinical practice. Ligamentopathies and tendinopathies, spontaneous ruptures of tendons after slight strain, dislocation of vertebrae and an accumulation of prolapsed intervertebral discs as well as ossifi-cation of tendon insertions can be viewed in this light...|$|R

Following the second post-natal week, fast growing male chicks were deprived of pyridoxine for a 1 -mo period. Six weeks post-natally, blood concentrations in the experimental deficiency group had declined to deficiency levels as registered by low concentrations of pyridoxal phosphate (coenzyme form) in erythrocytes, but did not reach levels associated with neurological symptoms. Light microscopic study showed abnormalities in the extracellular matrix of the connective tissues. Collagen cross-links and the aldehyde contents were not significantly lower in cartilage and <b>tendon</b> <b>collagens</b> of vitamin B- 6 -deficient animals than in age-matched controls; also, their proteoglycan degrading protease and collagenase activities measured in articular cartilages were not greater. Thus, proteolysis was an unlikely alternative mechanism {{to account for the}} loss of connective tissue integrity.

40|$|Because of {{its unique}} {{physical}} and chemical properties, rat tail <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> has long been favored for crystallographic and biochemical studies of fibril structure. In studies {{of the distribution of}} 3 -hydroxyproline in type I collagen of rat bone, skin, and tail tendon by mass spectrometry, the repeating sequences of Gly-Pro-Pro (GPP) triplets at the C terminus of α 1 (I) and α 2 (I) chains were shown to be heavily 3 -hydroxylated in tendon but not in skin and bone. By isolating the tryptic peptides and subjecting them to Edman sequence analysis, the presence of repeating 3 -hydroxyprolines in consecutive GPP triplets adjacent to 4 -hydroxyproline was confirmed as a unique feature of the <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen.</b> A 1960 s study by Piez et al. (Piez, K. A., Eigner, E. A., and Lewis, M. S.

The present work therefore confirms this difference and localizes the additional 3 Hyp to the GPP repeat at the C terminus of the triple-helix.

To determine whether a high level of oestradiol has an acute influence on collagen synthesis in tendons at rest and in response to exercise, one-legged kicking exercise was performed for 60 min at 67 % of maximum power by healthy, young oral contraceptive (OC) users when circulating synthetic (ethinyl) oestradiol was high (n = 11, HE-OC) and compared to similar women who had never used OCs when circulating endogenous oestrogen was low (n = 12, LE-NOC). Interstitial fluid was collected 24 h post-exercise through microdialysis catheters placed anterior to the patellar tendon in both legs and subsequently analysed for the amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), a marker of <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis. To determine the long-term effect of OC usage, patellar tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A lower exercise-induced increase in <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis was observed in HE-OC than in LE-NOC (ΔPINP (mean ±s. e. m.) 1. 5 ± 5. 3 versus 24. 2 ± 9. 4 ng ml− 1, P < 0. 05). Furthermore, serum and the interstitial peritendinous tissue concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding proteins showed a reduced bioavailability in HE-OC compared with results in LE-NOC. No difference in patellar tendon CSA was observed between groups. In conclusion, the selective increase in <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> synthesis in LE-NOC but not HE-OC 24 h post-exercise is consistent with the hypothesis that oestradiol inhibits exercise-induced collagen synthesis in human tendon. The mechanism behind this is either a direct effect of oestradiol, or an indirect effect via a reduction in levels of free IGF-I.

We (1) provide a methodology for determining the diameters of collagen fibers accounting for atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging artifacts, (2) present data on structural differences in sciatic nerve endoneurial, epineurial and tail <b>tendon</b> <b>collagens</b> of control and diabetic Sprague–Dawley and BioBreeding rats, and (3) compare results with literature values. Methods We measured collagen diameters and band spacing on endoneurial and epineurial sciatic nerve tissue, and tail tendon, in control and diabetic rats (STZ-induced 12 -week diabetic SD and 16 -week spontaneously diabetic BB rats). We also developed a model to interpret the raw AFM data. Results All types of fibrillar collagen diameters studied became larger for diabetic versus control animals. Values for diabetic and control collagen fiber diameters in SD rats were 78 nm and 72 nm for SN epineurium, and 49 nm and 43 nm for SN endoneurium. For diabetic and control BB rats, these values were 83 nm and 77 nm (SN epineurium) and 49 nm and 43 nm (SN endoneurium). Values of 161 nm and 125 nm were found for diabetic and control tail tendon of BB rats. No significant changes were observed in any of the five comparisons made in D-band spacings that ranged from 63 to 69 nm.

40|$|Abstract Background Tenocytes {{have been}} implicated in the {{development}} of tendinosis, a chronic condition commonly seen in musculoskeletal overuse syndromes. However, the relation between abnormal tenocyte morphology and early changes in the fibrillar collagen matrix has not been closely examined in vivo. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy is a recently developed technique which allows examination of fibrillar collagen structures {{with a high degree of}} specificity and resolution. The goal of this study was to examine the potential utility of SHG and multiphoton excitation fluorescence (MPEF) microscopy in understanding the relation between tenocytes and their surrounding collagenous matrix in early tendon overuse lesions. Methods Histological preparations of tendon were prepared from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to an Achilles tendon loading protocol for 12 weeks (Rat-A-PED), or from sedentary age-matched cage controls. Second harmonic generation and multiphoton excitation fluorescence were performed simultaneously on these tissue sections in at least three different areas. Results SHG microscopy revealed an association between abnormal tenocyte morphology and morphological changes in the fibrillar collagen matrix of mechanically loaded Achilles <b>tendons.</b> <b>Collagen</b> density and organization was significantly reduced in focal micro-regions of mechanically loaded tendons. These pathological changes occurred specifically in association with altered tenocyte morphology. Normal tendons displayed a regular distribution of fibre bundles, and the average size of these bundles as determined by Gaussian analysis was 0. 47 μm ± 0. 02. In comparison, fibre bundle measures from tendon regions in the vicinity of abnormal tenocytes could not be quantified due to a reduction in their regularity of distribution and orientation. Conclusions SHG microscopy allowed high resolution detection of focal tendon abnormalities affecting the fibrillar collagen matrix. With ongoing repetitive loading, these tenocyte-associated focal collagen defects could predispose to the progression of overuse pathology. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to {{platelet}} GPIbalpha and to collagen {{is attributed}} to VWF A 1 and A 3 domains, respectively. OBJECTIVES: Using VWF, VWF lacking A 1 (DeltaA 1 -VWF) or A 3 (DeltaA 3 -VWF) and VWF with defective A 3 (H 1786 A-VWF), in combination with recombinant A 1 (residues 1262 - 1492) or A 3 (residues 1671 - 1878), fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST-A 1 and GST-A 3), we have re-investigated the role of A 1 in platelet recruitment to surfaces of collagen. METHODS AND RESULTS: In flow, measurable binding of DeltaA 3 -VWF occurred to horse tendon, but also to human type III collagen. GST-A 1 and GST-A 3 both competed for binding of DeltaA 1 -VWF and DeltaA 3 -VWF to horse <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> fibrils in static conditions and to human collagen III during plasmon surface resonance studies, substantiating overlapping binding sites on both collagens for A 1 and A 3. Heparin did not affect A 3 -mediated binding of VWF and DeltaA 1 -VWF, but inhibited binding to horse <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> of GST-A 1 and DeltaA 3 -VWF. Furthermore, A 1 -mediated binding to type III collagen of DeltaA 3 -VWF binding was strongly salt-sensitive. During perfusions at wall shear rate 2500 s(- 1) of calcein-labeled platelets in reconstituted blood, DeltaA 3 -VWF and H 1786 A-VWF triggered platelet binding to horse <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> comparably and as potently as VWF, and to human type III collagen, only fivefold less potently, DeltaA 1 -VWF being inactive. Additional flow-controlled interaction studies with DeltaA 3 -VWF, H 1786 A-VWF, the collagen-VWF antagonist saratin, heparin and the VWF neutralizing antibody 82 D 6 A 3 confirmed that H 1786 A-VWF binds to collagen exclusively via A 1. CONCLUSION: Hence, in shear forces the VWF A 1 domain can {{assume the role of}} A 3 to trigger substantial platelet recruitment to human collagen fibres. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle and tendon the extracellular matrix confers important tensile properties and is crucially important for tissue regeneration after injury. Musculoskeletal tissue adaptation {{is influenced by}} mechanical loading, which modulates the availability of growth factors, including growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which may be of key importance. To test the hypothesis that GH promotes matrix collagen synthesis in musculotendinous tissue, we investigated the effects of 14 day administration of 33 – 50 μg kg− 1 day− 1 recombinant human GH (rhGH) in healthy young individuals. rhGH administration caused an increase in serum GH, serum IGF-I, and IGF-I mRNA expression in tendon and muscle. <b>Tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> I mRNA expression and <b>tendon</b> <b>collagen</b> protein synthesis increased by 3. 9 -fold and 1. 3 -fold, respectively (P < 0. 01 and P= 0. 02), and muscle collagen I mRNA expression and muscle collagen protein synthesis increased by 2. 3 -fold and 5. 8 -fold, respectively (P < 0. 01 and P= 0. 06). Myofibrillar protein synthesis was unaffected by elevation of GH and IGF-I. Moderate exercise did not enhance the effects of GH manipulation. Thus, increased GH availability stimulates matrix collagen synthesis in {{skeletal muscle}} and tendon, but without any effect upon myofibrillar protein synthesis.

Spectra were obtained from native rat tail <b>tendon</b> (RTT) <b>collagen</b> and from cholesteric liquid crystal-like (LC) type I collagen films. Although RTT and LC collagen both possess long-range order, LC collagen lacks the complex hierarchical organization of RTT collagen. Their spectra were compared to assess the role of such organization in NLO chirality. No significant differences were observed between RTT and LC with respect to chiral or achiral spectra. These findings suggest that amide I NLO chiral effects in type I collagen assemblies arise predominantly from the chiral organization of amide chromophores within individual collagen molecules, rather than from supramolecular structures. The study suggests that sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy may be uniquely valuable in exploring fundamental aspects of chiral nonlinearity in complex macromolecular structures...|$|R

This suggested roles for other related molecules, i. e. collagen XI, and compound Col 5 a 1 +/−,Col 11 a 1 +/− tendons had altered fibril structures, supporting a role for collagen XI. To further evaluate this, transcript expression was analyzed in wild type tendons.

40|$|Tendons are {{composed}} of fibroblasts and collagen fibrils. The fibrils are organized uniaxially and grouped together into fibers. Collagen VI is a non-fibrillar collagen expressed in developing and adult <b>tendons.</b> Human <b>collagen</b> VI mutations result in muscular dystrophy, joint hyperlaxity and contractures. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the functional roles of <b>collagen</b> VI in <b>tendon</b> matrix assembly. During <b>tendon</b> development, <b>collagen</b> VI was expressed throughout the extracellular matrix, but enriched around fibroblasts and their processes. To analyze the functional roles of collagen VI a mouse model with a targeted inactivation of Col 6 a 1 gene was utilized. Ultrastructural analysis of Col 6 a 1 -/- versus wild type tendons demonstrated disorganized extracellular micro-domains and associated collagen fibers in the Col 6 a 1 -/- tendon. In Col 6 a 1 -/- tendons, fibril structure and diameter distribution were abnormal compared to wild type controls. The diameter distributions were shifted significantly toward the smaller diameters in Col 6 a 1 -/- tendons compared to controls. An analysis of fibril density (number/μm(2)) demonstrated a ~ 2. 5 fold increase in the Col 6 a 1 -/- versus wild type tendons. In addition, the fibril arrangement and structure were aberrant in the peri-cellular regions of Col 6 a 1 -/- tendons with frequent very large fibrils and twisted fibrils observed restricted to this region. The biomechanical properties were analyzed in mature tendons. A significant decrease in cross-sectional area was observed. The percent relaxation, maximum load, maximum stress, stiffness and modulus were analyzed and Col 6 a 1 -/- tendons demonstrated a significant reduction in maximum load and stiffness compared to wild type tendons. An increase in matrix metalloproteinase activity was suggested in the absence of collagen VI. This suggests alterations in tenocyte expression due to disruption of cell-matrix interactions. The changes in expression may result in alterations in the peri-cellular environment. In addition, the absence of collagen VI may alter the sequestering of regulatory molecules such as leucine rich proteoglycans. These changes would result in dysfunctional regulation of tendon fibrillogenesis indirectly mediated by collagen VI...|$|R
50|$|The use of {{embryonic}} stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair. The {{embryonic stem cells}} were shown {{to have a better}} survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. The overall repair quality was also higher, with better <b>tendon</b> architecture and <b>collagen</b> formed. There was also no tumor formation seen during the three-month experimental period. Long-term studies need to be carried out to examine the long-term efficacy and risks associated with the use {{of embryonic}} stem cells. Similar results have been found in small animals.|$|R
50|$|ECM {{biomaterials}} {{are used}} to promote healing {{in a number of}} tissues, especially the skin and <b>tendons.</b> Surgimend, a <b>collagen</b> matrix derived from fetal bovine dermis, can trigger the healing of tendons (which do not heal spontaneously) in the ankle. This intervention can shorten healing time by almost half and allows the patient to return to full activity much sooner. Open wounds, like tendons, do not spontaneously heal and can persist for long stretches of time. When ECM biomaterials are added in multiple layers to the ulcer, the wound begins to close quickly and generates host tissue. Although preliminary studies seem promising, little information is available on the success of and direct comparisons between different ECM biomaterial devices in human trials.|$|R
