5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
500|$|Almost immediately, some astronomers {{questioned}} Pluto's {{status as}} a planet. Barely a month after its discovery was announced, on 14 April 1930, {{in an article in}} the New York Times, Armin O. Leuschner suggested that Pluto's dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet: [...] "The Lowell result confirms the possible high eccentricity announced by us on April 5. Among <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> a large asteroid greatly disturbed in its orbit by close approach to a major planet such as Jupiter, or it may be one of many long-period planetary objects yet to be discovered, or a bright cometary object." [...] In that same article, Harvard Observatory director Harlow Shapley wrote that Pluto was a [...] "member of the Solar System not comparable with known asteroids and comets, and perhaps of greater importance to cosmogony than would be another major planet beyond Neptune." [...] In 1931, using a mathematical formula, Ernest W. Brown asserted (in agreement with E. C. Bower), that the presumed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus could not be due to the gravitational effect of a more distant planet, and thus that Lowell's supposed prediction was [...] "purely accidental".|$|E

50|$|A 1995 {{panel of}} 13 {{scientists}} reviewing {{studies on the}} carcinogenicity of 2,4-D had divided opinions. None of the scientists thought {{the weight of the}} evidence indicated that 2,4-D was a “known” or “probable” cause of human cancer. The predominant opinion indicated that it is possible that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans, although not all of the panelists believed <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> equally likely: one thought <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> strong, leaning toward probable, and five thought <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> remote, leaning toward unlikely.

It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact there are certainly going to be many new ones popping in (and out) over the season. And hey, if we learned anything from last season's Queens of Darkness, it's that maybe we'll at least get some awesome wardrobe changes for Emma. Some darker eyeliner?

2500|$|Salme {{went on the}} Saint-Domingue {{expedition}} {{arriving in}} Hispaniola on 5 February 1802. He was assigned to command the 13th Brigade in Jean Hardy's division. The expedition commander Charles Leclerc immediately organized a sweep to round up Haitian forces led by Toussaint Louverture. During the operation, Hardy took Salme's brigade on an all-night march to surprise a Haitian base at Bayonnais. Much of Haiti was brought under French control but large Haitian forces escaped and Hardy's division returned to Cap-Français. Leclerc promoted Salme general of division on 15 May 1802 and immediately set him back to France for reasons which remain unclear. <b>The</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> that he was sick, that he was harshly critical of restoring slavery in Hispaniola, that he was dealing in the black market and, finally, that he had become the lover of Pauline Bonaparte, Leclerc's wife. In any case he was directed {{to report on the}} condition of the army when he got back to France. That year Leclerc and Hardy and most of the army perished from yellow fever.|$|E
2500|$|As in {{some other}} Ethiopian Semitic languages, there are {{separate}} [...] "light" [...] and [...] "heavy" [...] suffixes {{for all but the}} second person and first-person plural prepositional object forms. [...] The light suffixes (-ni, -xa, etc.) are characterized by initial ungeminated consonants and the heavy suffixes (-nni, -kka, etc.) by initial geminated consonants. [...] For the third person direct object suffixes, there is a third form with no initial consonant at all (-o, -a, etc.). Roughly speaking, the light suffixes are used with verbs whose subjects are second or third person plural, the third person vowel-initial suffixes are used with verbs that have no agreement suffix, and the heavy suffixes are used in other cases. In the jussive/imperative, the vowel-initial suffixes cause the gemination of the preceding consonant. When an object suffix beginning with a consonant is added to a verb ending in a consonant (either a root or a suffix consonant), a vowel is inserted to break up the cluster, the particular vowel depending on the subject and object. The details are quite complicated; most of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>are</b> illustrated in the following table for two different object and four different subject categories, using the verb fälät'ä (3A) 'know'.|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} the fuzzy set theory was {{initiated}} by Zadeh via the membership function [22]. In order to measure a fuzzy event, <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure <b>is</b> proposed.

Although <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure has <b>been</b> widely used, it does not possess the self-duality property. Thus, if <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure equals one {{it does not mean}} the event will happen definitely, while the event may happen even though <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> measure <b>is</b> zero. So the solution to the fuzzy decision problem has been a mathematical conundrum for a long time.|$|R
