When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E

25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E

500|$|Alignment in D—which determines a character's {{ethical and}} moral {{perspective}} on the independent axes of [...] "good vs. evil" [...] and [...] "law vs. chaos"—is a static property, chosen by the player {{at the start of}} a game. In Planescape: Torment, the character begins as a [...] "true neutral" [...] character (that is, neither good nor evil, and neither lawful nor chaotic) and throughout the game, based on the character's actions, this property is incrementally changed. Non-player characters respond to The Nameless One differently, depending on his alignment. A review in NextGen reported that [...] "the game caters to both the goody-goody player who wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> and lawful, and the evil bastards who just want to kill everything and take no guff from anyone".|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{started their}} defence {{of the league}} {{championship}} at home to Queens Park Rangers on 17 August 1991. It was the visitors who had led the match right from the 15th minute, but for Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson to earn his side a point after equalising well into stoppage time. The draw according to The Independent showcased the need for reinforcements: [...] "...not just to improve the squad, but also to cause a buzz in the dressing room". Arsenal were beaten 3–1 by Everton at Goodison Park three days after and lost to Aston Villa by the same scoreline. Graham dismissed any talk of crisis, saying [...] "I have been in football too long to {{think it is going}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> and comfortable every season" [...] and felt the performance at Villa showed signs of improvement compared to the earlier league fixtures. A 2–0 win at home to Luton Town was followed by victory against Manchester City, where Alan Smith and Limpar scored a goal apiece.|$|E

April becomes frustrated because she only dated Eduardo to make Andy jealous. She dumps Eduardo, which Chris interprets as a sign that his efforts are succeeding. Ann (Rashida Jones), who was nervous about Andy and Chris spending time together, is relieved when Chris tells her that Andy had nothing but positive things to say about her. The episode ends with the Pawnee residents [...] including Kelly and his daughter [...] watching an outdoor screening of the Twilight film.|$|E

[...] Likewise, Lana Parrilla, who later herself played the Evil Queen in Once Upon A Time, said that whenever she watched Disney's Snow White as a young girl she rooted for and [...] "loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She was just so fascinating to me." [...] Author Deborah Lipp wrote: [...] "As I've said before and will doubtless say again, given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror now!" [...] Film director John Waters said he too rooted for the evil queen to win, and Chay Yew said that if he were a Disney character, he would be the evil queen from Snow White.|$|E

Afterwards, Meretskov was promoted to rank of army general and made Deputy Commissar of Defense. From August 1940 to January 1941 he was Chief of the General Staff. He was dismissed on 14 January 1941, and on 24 January, Stalin spotted him at the Bolshoi and, in front of witnesses: [...] "You are courageous, capable, but without principles, spineless.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on February 6, 2014, with The Record, Sokolich said that the Christie administration had courted his endorsement {{over a period of}} time going back to around 2010, when Christie invited Sokolich and a handful of other mayors, including Hoboken's Dawn Zimmer, to have lunch at the governor's mansion in Princeton. Christie was shown in a picture talking with local mayors in a lineup, including Sokolich, after a news conference in Teaneck on December 8, 2011. In 2012, Sokolich and his cousins were given a personal tour of the 9/11 Memorial Plaza by Wildstein, who repeatedly told Sokolich, [...] "I've been told <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> to you." [...] Matt Mowers, regional political director for Christie's re-election campaign, who had previously worked in the governor's intergovernmental affairs office, met with Sokolich regularly in 2013 and told him about other Democrats who endorsed Christie for governor. On at least three occasions, Sokolich noted that Mowers brought up the subject of Sokolich's possible endorsement. Sokolich eventually supported Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in the 2013 election. Christie said at his January 9, 2014, press conference that Sokolich was [...] "never on my radar screen" [...] and that he would not [...] "have been able to pick him [...] out of a lineup." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick Bond of News.com.au {{described}} Dicko's {{criticism of}} Paulini's gold dress as [...] "one {{of the most}} controversial moments in Australian Idol history," [...] while Andrew Bucklow from the same publication labelled it one of the show's [...] "most infamous moments" [...] ever. During Dicko's appearance on The Celebrity Apprentice Australia in 2012, he revealed that [...] "people were virtually spitting on me" [...] after that Australian Idol episode had aired, calling it a defining moment for him because he [...] "became a national pariah" [...] overnight. In an episode of The Celebrity Apprentice and in reference to the gold dress controversy, Dicko made a statue of someone wearing a gold dress with the word [...] "sorry" [...] printed on it. Paulini appeared in the episode to see what Dicko had made and she accepted his apology. In 2014, Dicko told Woman's Day that he does not regret what he said to Paulini, saying [...] "It’s part of who I am and who Paulini is and it binds us together." [...] In July 2017, Dicko apologised again in a pre-recorded message he left for Paulini during her radio interview on Hot 91.1 FM's breakfast show, Dave, Sam & Ash.

2500|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, {{and was the}} first role cast. Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final {{appearance}} on Doctor Who. Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: [...] "We talked a lot about the role of a vicar in a community like that and {{what are the implications of}} the circumstances that the town is put in," [...] said Darvill, [...] "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young." [...] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and trustworthy person. Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect. Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set. [...] "Early on I knew it was going to be good because Chris said...veryone has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> and good." ...|$|E

Stanley is always trying desperately to get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode [...] "Mr. Perfect". He loves to eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against Chelsea in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode ("Taken to the Cleaners"), he asks Victor to make him a cheese sandwich {{in the shape of a}} ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include [...] "My brotha!", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to [...] "show someone up"; and [...] "I may have said that, but I say a lot of things." [...] This is a partial denial of his ability <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> to other people.
