Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. <b>This</b> <b>remote</b> area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, the Avars {{turned off}} to Dalmatia, where they sacked several fortresses, {{avoiding}} direct confrontation with Priscus.

25|$|Turkic {{expansion}} {{began in}} the 6th century, and following the Göktürk empire, Turkic tribes quickly spread westward across all of Central Asia. The Turkic speaking Uyghurs were one of many distinct cultural groups brought together by the trade of the Silk Route at Turfan, which was then ruled by China's Tang Dynasty. The Uyghurs, primarily pastoral nomads, observed a number of religions including Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Nestorian Christianity.

Buses, private vehicles, and heavy trucking operations run along this route. This highway is used for transportation of supplies to the town and to the mine from barges on the Fly River. The highway is heavily used by trucking operations heading to and from the port. Slurry of copper concentrate from the mine is sent to the river port along a 137km pipeline which runs parallel to this highway. The Kiunga-Tabubil Highway is one of the only all-weather roads in the province, and most other roads in the district feed into <b>this</b> <b>remote</b> highway.|$|E
25|$|The sale of Load Balancer {{left the}} company with staff and cash, but no product. Freedman had {{developed}} and marketed a 3-day UNIX security course in 1992, and had developed significant contacts within the banking, defense, and chip-making communities. These customers all had similar problems in managing large UNIX networks, specifically concerning the control and audit {{of the actions of}} the systems' administrators. The problem was that the root account used by systems administrators when reconfiguring parts of the system, was able to edit any of the audit trails created by the system. Freedman designed a new product, PowerBroker, that was similar in concept to today's sudo products, but which allowed centralized control and auditing of an entire network even down to the keystroke level, with the logs stored on a dedicated remote computer to which the system administrators typically did not have access. By vetting all access and logging through <b>this</b> <b>remote</b> machine, a secure log could be maintained. The system was ported to over 22 versions of UNIX to accommodate the newer, larger networks with hundreds or thousands of machines. Dean Huxley was responsible for most of the system-level programming on PowerBroker with Kevin Chmilar and Earle Lowe also contributing.|$|E
25|$|The first {{international}} Baha'i Youth Conference held in Costa Rica came about in 1972 {{two days after}} the Managua earthquake. However a minibus full of young people came through Honduras with only minor difficulties and two Nicaraguan youth got through. Total attendance was about seventy-five. 1977 also saw the first time a Bahá'í float was entered in one of the annualfestivals in Santa Cruz. A larger conference of about 200 gathered in January 1978. Some of the attendees, together with various adults, then took a trip into Guanacaste province where over a short time 14 new assemblies were founded and then they extended work into Meseta province (see San Ramón for mention of <b>this</b> <b>remote</b> province) where several groups were re-contacted and a new assembly elected. In 1983 the Universal House of Justice recognized the twin youth conferences of Honduras and Costa Rica held in early March - a challenge representing a substantial {{increase in the number of}} youth Bahá'ís - and called on them to consider the example of `Abdu'l-Bahá in civilizing influences they should undertake individually and collectively. In the fall of 1984 a permanent site for the National Youth Institute was chosen and plans were developed for it to serve as a center for the arts and performance, agriculture and outreach programs. A television crew made up of two youth from EI Salvador, a Bahá'í from Venezuela, and two non-Baha'i volunteers filmed Costa Rica's 1988 international youth conference which was attended by 120 people for a program to be aired in El Salvador.|$|E
