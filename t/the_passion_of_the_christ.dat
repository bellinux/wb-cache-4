5|$|While Aronofsky's {{other movies}} have evoked {{significant}} emotional response, {{they were still}} far from the turmoil aroused by Noah. It was screened {{for the first time}} on March 28, 2014, and despite its PG-13 rating, it has quickly been recognized by Box Office Mojo as one of the most controversial movies of the last 35 years along with such titles as <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> or The Da Vinci Code. Noah has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ,</b> a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} <b>The</b> <b>Passion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.
