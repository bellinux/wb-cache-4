5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, and in <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> caused a longer harm {{to the public as}} a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E

5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures <b>that</b> <b>sense</b> light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, slate {{quarrying}} began to expand rapidly, {{most notably in}} north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry, opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant, was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, and along with Dinorwic Quarry, it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying {{has been described as}} 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', it is coal mining which has become the single industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw a boom in its demand. As the south Wales coalfield was exploited, mainly in the upland valleys around Aberdare and later the Rhondda, the ports of Swansea, Cardiff and later Penarth, grew into world exporters of coal and, with them, came a population boom. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. As well as in south Wales, there was also a significant coalfield in the north-east of the country, particularly around Wrexham. As Wales was reliant on the production of capital goods rather than consumer goods, it possessed few of the skilled craftspeople and artisans found in the workshops of Birmingham or Sheffield in England and had few factories producing finished goods – a key feature of most regions associated with the Industrial Revolution. However, there is increasing support that the industrial revolution was reliant on harnessing the energy and materials provided by Wales and, in <b>that</b> <b>sense,</b> Wales was of central importance.|$|E

50|$|The {{expression}} of the ethanolamine utilization genes (eutG) is influenced by two different mechanisms. The first is a two component regulatory system <b>that</b> <b>senses</b> the presence of ethanolamine and the second mechanism is an AdoCbl riboswitch <b>that</b> <b>senses</b> the presence of AdoCbl, a cofactor needed for the breakdown of ethanolamine. A study showed that both these regulatory elements need to be activated for the bacteria to grow efficiently on medium containing ethanolamine. Bioinformatic studies were initially unsuccessful in identifying AdoCbl riboswitches within the bacteria genomes, but subsequent studies of the intergenic regions of the eutG locus using Ribex identified an RNA element between the eutT and eutG genes.|$|R
