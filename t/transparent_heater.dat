40|$|<b>Transparent</b> <b>heaters</b> are {{important}} for many applications {{and in the future}} are likely to be fabricated from thin, conducting, nanostructured networks. However, the electrical properties of such networks are almost always controlled by percolative effects. The impact of percolation on heating effects has not been considered, and the material parameter combinations that lead to efficient performance are not known. In fact, figures of merit for <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters</b> have not been elucidated, either in bulk-like or percolative systems. Here, we develop a simple yet comprehensive model describing the operation of <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters.</b> By considering the balance of Joule heating versus power dissipated by both convection and radiation, we derive an expression for the time-dependent heater temperature as a function of both electrical and thermal parameters. This equation can be modified to describe the relationship between temperature, optical transmittance, and electrical/thermal parameters in both bulk-like and percolative systems. By performing experiments on silver nanowire networks, systems known to display both bulk-like and percolative regimes, we show the model to describe real systems extremely well. This work shows the performance of <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters</b> in the percolative regime to be significantly less efficient compared to the bulk-like regime, implying the diameter of the nanowires making up the network to be critical. The model allows the identification of figures of merit for networks in both bulk-like and percolative regimes.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{scalable}} fabrication {{of a novel}} <b>transparent</b> <b>heater</b> (TH) architecture by continuously creating metallic micromesh patterns on a flexible substrate via Photo Roll Lithography (PRL). The optimal TH structure is explored by systematically investigating the heating and transmittance characteristics depending on the metal material, thickness, and micromesh dimension. The transmittance is further enhanced by incorporating the biomimetic moth-eye anti-reflection layer (ARC) which effectively reduces the reflection along with diffiraction and scattering of incident light. The fabricated ARC-integrated TH exhibits an excellent transmittance with satisfactory heating up to 47. 5 (omicron) C at the applied current of 0. 6 A, which demonstrates ten times more power-efficient than conventional macroscale wire defrosters used in most vehicles. Successful defrosting of both planar and curved large-area surfaces is visually demonstrated by attaching the 70 x 70 mm-sized THs fabricated on a glass or flexible polymer.

Experimental work is focused on the influence of nanowire density as well as defects within the nanostructured network such as the inhomogeneity of the network, the grain-boundary along a nanowire, the morphological nanowire instabilities… The influence of these defects on the physical properties of this promising nanostructured network will be presentedPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} on new Transparent Conductive Materials focuses on emerging {{materials such as}} carbon-based materials, graphene or metallic nanowire networks. The latter concern mainly silver nanowires (AgNW). Although AgNW networks seem to approach ITO values in terms of optical transparency and electrical sheet resistance, (90 % and 10 Ω/sq respectively) [1], overcoming a rather poor thermal and electrical stability still remains a challenge. While most device fabrication processes require thermal annealing steps to optimize their electrical properties, heating can modify AgNW network morphology. Moreover, when used as <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters,</b> an electrical current induces specimen heating (due to Joule effect) and then imposing AgNW network to be resistant to heat. One way to improve thermal stability of AgNW networks {{is to use a}} thin layer of a passivating metal oxide (such as ZnO or TiO 2) which induces stability improvements [2]. So far, our group has studied the effect of a thin layer of TiO 2 deposited by ALD on the thermal and electrical stability of AgNWs networks. Our studies show that even a TiO 2 layer as thin as 5 nm can lead to an extension of thermal stability from 270 °C to 420 °C. The oxide coating also increases the value of the electrical failure voltage. This stability enhancement comes with nearly no change in optical transparency (less than 1 %). Currently we are replacing the ALD deposition method with a new approach called Spatial ALD (SALD). This technique does not require vacuum, it is much faster than conventional ALD and is easily scalable [3]. Here we will present a comprehensive study of the effect of deposition parameters, passivation film thickness on the electrical and optical properties of AgNWs based transparent electrodes. Optimized parameters will allow the integration in devices such as <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters.</b> We will demonstrate that adding a passivation layer increases the breakdown voltage, making the devices stable at higher voltage or temperature.

30|$|Indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) thin film can show {{as high as}} 95 % {{transmittance}} (T) with resistance (Rs) < 100  Ω/□, but the expensive cost, emerging indium scarcity and brittle property of ITO, results {{to be limited to}} apply in flexible film [14]. However, silver has the highest electrical conductivity (6.3 [*]×[*] 107  S/m) and thermal conductivity (429  W m− 1  K- 1) among all the metals [15].

40|$|The {{subject of}} the present work is heat {{transfer}} close to moving three-phase contact lines. The term three-phase contact line designates {{the area in which}} the liquid/vapour- or liquid/gas-interface approaches a solid wall. Due to the small thermal resistance of the extremely thin liquid film high heat fluxes are reached within this area. These can have significant influence onto the overall heat transfer process within two-phase systems. Examples of such systems are pool and flow boiling, droplet evaporation during spray cooling applications or heat pipes used for high power electronics cooling. The more the interface approaches to the heated wall, the stronger the influence of intermolecular interactions between wall molecules and those at the liquid/vapour-interface onto the local phase equilibrium becomes. This results in a shift of the equilibrium to higher temperatures, so that local evaporation is entirely inhibited through intermolecular forces at a certain minimum liquid film thickness. A few molecule layers thin liquid film that cannot be evaporated remains on the apparently dry surface. Apart from the wall superheat, the direction of contact line movement and its velocity, as well as the system pressure influence the local heat transfer in the contact line area decisively. While there is some experimental work on the influence of contact line velocity and its movement direction, the influence of system pressure has remained uninvestigated up to date. Aim of this work is therefore a target oriented experimental investigation of the pressure and velocity influence on heat transfer in the proximity of moving three-phase contact lines. Core of the dedicated experiment setup is an infrared <b>transparent</b> <b>heater</b> element, which provides the possibility to measure the temperature fields at the heater/fluid interface with high spatial and temporal resolution using infrared thermography. The heater developed for this purpose consists of an infrared transparent substrate, onto which a two-layer composition of black Chromium Nitride and pure Chromium with an overall thickness of approximately 800 nm is applied through Physical Vapour Deposition. While the black Chromium Nitride layer enhances the surface emissivity and thereby increases the signal-to-noise-ratio of the IR thermography drastically, the pure Chromium is employed as resistance heater to achieve the wall superheat necessary for evaporation. As experiment fluid degassed FC- 72 (n-perfluorohexane) is used. Within the experiment setup a single capillary slot with a width of 1. 4 mm is created between the infrared <b>transparent</b> <b>heater</b> and a polished copper wall. Liquid rises between the walls of the slot due to capillary forces and forms a single extended meniscus. The system pressure is adjusted through the saturation state of the fluid by variation of the system temperature, while the movement of the meniscus is realized through a volume displacement within the system. Movement of the meniscus results in an advancing or a receding contact line situation at the surface of the IR <b>transparent</b> <b>heater,</b> that influences the local temperature distribution at the heater wall. The temperature distribution on the backside of the Chromium Nitride layer at a distance of less than 1 micrometer away from the heater/fluid-interface is measured with a high speed IR camera at a framerate of 1000 Hz and a resolution of 29. 27 micrometer/pixel. The high speed IR camera is synchronized to a high speed black-and-white camera, that allows detection of the liquid/vapour-interface with a resolution of 4 micrometer/pixel. From the temperature fields the local heat flux distribution is calculated numerically with the same spatial and temporal resolution. Experiments were performed at reduced pressures in the range of p_R = 0. 05 to p_R = 0. 7 and with liquid/vapour-interface velocities of up to v_int = +- 40 mm/s. Comparisons to earlier experiments on three-phase contact line heat transfer show, that the results obtained using thin foil heaters are transferable to heaters with substantial larger thermal inertia, like the IR transparent heaters used within this work. Merely the extremely high temperature differences, that are present in proximity of the contact line, are significantly smaller on walls with higher thermal inertia. The conducted experiments clearly show a local heat flux peak in proximity of the contact line, which is accompanied by a local temperature minimum. At increased system pressure and equal wall superheat and contact line velocity, the local heat flux peak at the contact line decreases with increasing pressure. This effect {{can be attributed to the}} reduction of latent heat of evaporation with increasing pressure. Considering the influence of the contact line velocity, one must distinguish between advancing and receding contact lines. At a receding contact line and equal reduced pressure and wall superheat, no influence of the contact line velocity onto the local heat flux distribution in proximity of the contact line is discernible. At an advancing contact line on the other hand, an increase of the heat flux maximum at the wall and thereby the heat transfer in proximity of the contact line with increasing contact line velocity is observed. Both the increase of the heat flux maximum with increasing contact line velocity at an advancing contact line and the independence of the maximum heat flux on the contact line velocity at a receding contact line is observed at low and high levels of the reduced pressure. In some experiments with negative meniscus velocity (and therefore receding contact line) it was observed, that a thin, evaporating liquid film can be deposited on the heater surface by the moving liquid/vapour-interface. If and to which extend the thin film is deposited, depends on the wall superheat, the velocity and acceleration of the liquid/vapour-interface, the latent heat of evaporation of the fluid and the wetting characteristics of the heated wall. Furthermore it was observed, that film rupture due to instabilities can occur. If the thin film was present, the contribution of thin film evaporation to the overall heat transfer was dominating compared to the contribution of contact line heat transfer. This makes it necessary to describe the thin film with a model, if it appears during an evaporation process in order to capture the underlying physics correctly. Based on an estimation of the thickness of a liquid film staying behind on a wall drawn out of a quiescent liquid by Landau and Levich, a model for stationary thin film evaporation was developed. It is assumed, that thin film evaporation has no influence onto the initial film thickness, so it can be calculated according to Landau and Levich. Starting from the mass and energy balance at an infinitesimal thin segment of the film, an equation for the film thickness gradient in direction parallel to the wall is derived. By making the equation dimensionless, non-dimensional quantities governing thin film evolution are identified. Comparison of the length of the thin film region calculated using the model to lengths of the thin film region observed in the experiment shows good agreement up to a certain velocity, at which an increasing deviation between theoretical value and experimental data is observed. This deviation is probably caused by the limited length of the IR <b>transparent</b> <b>heater,</b> which does not allow for reaching steady state thin film evaporation...|$|E

There is evidence that for a given cross-sectional average void fraction, the local phase distributions can be different depending on whether the vapor phase is generated at the wall, or upstream of the test section inlet. In wall-heated flows, local void fraction profiles measured across both the wide and narrow test section dimensions illustrate the profound effect that pressure has on the local flow structure; notably, increasing pressure appears to thin the wall-bounded liquid films and redistribute liquid toward the edges of the test section.

The weightlessness environment of the fluid, which cancels buoyancy forces and favorites the three-dimensional spherical shape of the gas bubble, is proven to be an irreplaceable powerful tool for boiling studies. To identify each key mechanism of the boiling phenomena, the ALI-DECLIC experiments have benefited from (i) the well-adapted design of the test cells, (ii) the high-fidelity of the ALI insert teleoperation when long-duration experiment in stable thermal and microgravity environment are required and (iii) the high repeatability of the controlled thermal disturbances. These key mechanisms were observed by light transmission and interferometry technique independently with two sample cells filled with pure SF 6 at a near-critical density. The fluid samples are driven away from thermal equilibrium by using a heater directly implemented in the fluid, or a surface heater on a sapphire optical window. In the interferometry cell, the bulk massive heater distinguishes two symmetrical two-phase domains. The modification of the gas bubble shape is observed during heating. In the direct observation cell, the gas bubble is separated by a liquid film from the thin layered <b>transparent</b> <b>heater</b> deposited on the sapphire window.

FTEs can be applied to many optoelectronic devices as conductive components, involving touch screens [5, 6], portable solar cells [7, 8], organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) [9 – 11], fuel cell electrode [12 – 17], sensors [18, 19], PM filter [20], <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters</b> [21, 22], and wearable electronics [23, 24]. The dominant transparent electrodes (TEs) used currently is indium tin oxide (ITO) owing to the low sheet resistance (< 100  Ω/sq) and high transmittance (> 80 %). But its intrinsic brittleness limits the applications in flexible electronics. Moreover, it requires high temperature deposition process and is challenged by the scarcity of indium [25 – 27]. Therefore, several new conductive films with good flexibility and optical transparency, such as metal grids [2, 28, 29], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [30 – 33], graphene [34 – 36], Ag NWs [5, 37 – 41], Cu NWs [42, 43], conductive polymers [44, 45], and hybrids of these [46 – 48], have been fabricated, striving to replace ITO. Among these candidates, Ag NWs films have been investigated extensively in both the scientific and industrial institutions, owing to the excellent electrical conductivity and high optical transparency. In addition, Ag NWs exhibit outstanding flexibility and stretchability, which is the one of the appealing advantage to fabricate stretchable transparent conductors than fragile ITO [49 – 51].

40|$|For the {{application}} of minichannel heat exchangers, {{it is necessary to}} have accurate design tools for predicting heat transfer and pressure drop. Until recently, this type of heat exchangers was not well studied, and in the scientific literature there were large discrepancies between results reported by different investigators. The present thesis aims to add to the knowledge of the fundamentals of single- and two-phase flow heat transfer and pressure drop in narrow channels, thereby aiding in the development of this new, interesting technology with the possibility of decreasing the size of electronics through better cooling, and of increasing the energy efficiency of thermal processes and thermodynamic cycles through enhanced heat transfer. A comprehensive experimental single-phase flow and saturated flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop study has been carried out on vertical stainless steel tubes with inner diameters of 1. 700, 1. 224 and 0. 826 mm, using R- 134 a as the test fluid. The heat transfer and pressure drop results were compared both to conventional correlations developed for larger diameter channels and to correlations developed specifically for microscale geometries. Contrary to many previous investigations, this study has shown that the test data agree well with single-phase heat transfer and friction factor correlations known to be accurate for larger channels, thus expanding their ranges to cover mini/microchannel geometries. The main part of the study concerns saturated flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop. Tests with the same stainless steel tubes showed that the heat transfer is strongly dependent on heat flux, but only weakly dependent on mass flux and vapor fraction (up to the location of dryout). This behavior is usually taken to indicate a dominant influence of nucleate boiling, and indicates that the boiling mechanism is strongly related to that in nucleate boiling. The test data for boiling heat transfer was compared to several correlations from the literature, both for macro- and mini-channels. A new correlation for saturated flow boiling heat transfer of refrigerant R- 134 a correlation was obtained based on the present experimental data. This correlation predicts the presented data with a mean absolute deviation of  8 %. The frictional pressure drop results were compared to both macro- and mini channel correlations available from the literature. The correlation suggested by Qu and Mudawar (2003) gave the best prediction to the frictional two-phase pressure drop within the studied ranges. A unique visualization study of saturated flow boiling characteristics in a vertical 1. 332 mm inner diameter quartz tube, coated with a <b>transparent</b> <b>heater</b> has also been conducted. The complete evaporation process in a heated circular mini-channel has been studied visually in detail using high speed CCD camera. The study revealed the developments of the flow patterns and the behavior from bubble nucleation to the dry out of the liquid film. The bubble departure frequency, diameter, growth rate, and velocity were determined by analyzing the images. Finally, a flow pattern map for boiling flow in microchannels has been developed based on the test data. QC 2010081...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates new {{alternative}} {{materials for}} flexible transparent electrodes: monolayer graphene and micron-scale metal mesh structures. Growth of graphene on copper foils by {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD) was investigated by commissioning and developing a CVD system in Tyndall. Initial growth runs resulted in poor graphene coverage. Several routes for growth improvement were examined: an acid pre-treatment, substrate geometry and growth pressure. Following this improvement, a continuous growth run was carried out displaying high monolayer graphene coverage. Graphene was transferred to Si/SiO 2 (90 nm thermal oxide) and glass substrates using a wet chemical transfer process. This process {{involves the use of}} a polymer which acts as a support mechanism. However, polymer residue can have drastic effects on the electrical performance of CVD graphene films. Therefore an alternative method for polymer removal with the use of heated acetone (~ 60 oC) was investigated. Micron-scale platinum mesh structures were fabricated on rigid glass substrates using a range of metal deposition techniques; metal evaporation and lift-off; ALD and dry etching and sputter deposition and dry etching. Square, hexagonal, circular and a new asymmetric pentagonal tiling were utilised as metal meshes. Their performance were investigated along with the metal deposition technique. Evaporation and lift-off provided the most consistent technique in relation to transparency, haze and sheet resistance. Finally, asymmetric pentagonal platinum meshes were fabricated on flexible transparent substrates using metal evaporation and lift-off. All designs were bent around a radius of curvature (in air) of ~ 3. 8 mm up to 1, 000 bending cycles for both tension and compression and suggested good performance in comparison to literature. All three designs were used as <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters</b> via Joule heating. All heaters demonstrated good thermal characteristics such as low response times and high thermal resistances. Finally, a pentagonal metal mesh was used to de-ice a glass substrate...|$|R

40|$|Highly {{flexible}} and <b>transparent</b> film <b>heaters</b> (TFHs) with superior mechanical and thermal stability were fabricated by embedding silver nanowires (AgNWs) into transparent polyimide (PI) films using a solution coating method. The fabricated AgNW/PI hybrid TFHs exhibited higher heating temperatures (similar to 96 degrees C) with lower input voltage (similar to 6 V), shorter response time (T < 40 s), and lower power consumption (160. 6 degrees C cm(2) W- 1) than ITO/FTO heaters, {{as well as}} stability after repeated use. The AgNW/PI hybrid TFHs also showed excellent resistance to bending. After undergoing outer bending for a 1000 times, the change of sheet resistance was less than 18 %. The effective embedment of the AgNW network in {{the surface of the}} transparent PI film not only decreased the surface roughness (R-rms < 1 nm) but also enhanced the resistance against oxidation and moisture.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that extracting the vapor from two-phase flow in a microchannel {{will result in}} a lowered pressure drop required to drive the flow. The goal of this thesis is to construct an experimental device that will test this hypothesis by comparing a number of phase separating test conditions to respective control conditions that do not allow for any phase separation. It was discovered that using a <b>transparent,</b> thin-film <b>heater</b> to boil flow in a microchannel required too much power; the heater designed and built for this purpose was burnt out during testing. Possible reasons for the burnout are discussed. The original test plan was modified to boil the flow prior to the microchannel. The trends found from the new test plan supported the hypothesis. Vapor extraction was related to decreases in the pressure drops; however, vapor extraction rates were measured well below their predicted values. Reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. In conclusion, it was found that vapor extraction does decrease microchanne...|$|R
40|$|The most {{efficient}} and widely used transparent conducting material (TCM) is currently {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO). However the indium scarcity associated {{to the lack of}} flexibility of ITO as well as relatively high cost of fabrication has prompted the search for alternative low cost and flexible materials. Among emerging transparent electrodes (TEs), silver nanowire (AgNW) networks appear as a promising substitute to ITO since these percolating networks exhibit high flexibility and excellent optoelectronic properties [1], with sheet resistance of a few Ω/sq and optical transparency of 90 %, fulfilling the requirements for many applications such as solar cells, OLED displays, <b>transparent</b> <b>heaters,</b> or radio-frequency (RF) antennas and transparent shielding [2]. In addition, the fabrication of these electrodes involves low-temperature process steps and upscaling methods, thus making them very appropriate for future use as TE for flexible devices. Our research is focused on the fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena taking place at the scales of both the network (macroscale) and the NW-to- NW junctions (nanoscale), and on the ability of AgNW networks to be integrated as transparent electrodes for flexible optoelectronic and RF devices. In-situ electrical measurements performed during optimisation process such as thermal annealing and/or chemical treatments provide useful information regarding the activation process of the junctions [3]. Besides, nano-characterisation techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and ultramicrotomy help visualizing the physical phenomena involved in the diffusion of silver atoms to create well-sintered junctions. At the network’s scale, our ability to distinguish the nanowires taking part in the electrical conduction (“electrical percolating pathways”) from the inactive nanowires is a critical issue for the applications. By combining experimental and simulation studies, a discrete activation process of efficient percolating pathways through the network was evidenced. In the case where the network density is close to the percolation threshold and when low voltage is applied, individual “illuminated” pathways can be detected through the network while new branches get activated as soon as the voltage is increased. Here we will present our results on the study of AgNW networks at the macro and nano scales described above and will correlate it with the overall performance/characteristics of the networks. We will also present results on the integration of optimized AgNW networks into functional devices. [1] D. P. Langley, G. Giusti, C. Mayousse, C. Celle, D. Bellet, J. -P.

40|$|International audienceTransparent {{electrodes}} attract intense {{attention in}} many technological fields, including optoelectronic devices, <b>transparent</b> film <b>heaters</b> and electromagnetic applications. New generation transparent electrodes {{are expected to}} have three main physical properties: high electrical conductivity, high transparency and mechanical flexibility. The most efficient and widely used transparent conducting material is currently indium tin oxide (ITO). However the scarcity of indium associated with ITO's lack of flexibility and the relatively high manufacturing costs have a prompted search into alternative materials. With their outstanding physical properties, metallic nanowire (MNW) -based percolating networks appear {{to be one of the}} most promising alternatives to ITO. They also have several other advantages, such as solution-based processing, and are compatible with large area deposition techniques. Estimations of cost of the technology are lower, in particular thanks to the small quantities of nanomaterials needed to reach industrial performance criteria. The present review investigates recent progress on the main applications reported for MNW networks of any sort (silver, copper, gold, core-shell nanowires) and points out some of the most impressive outcomes. Insights into processing MNW into high-performance transparent conducting thin films are also discussed according to each specific application. Finally, strategies for improving both their stability and integration into real devices are presented...|$|R
40|$|Advancement in {{the science}} and {{technology}} of random metallic nanowire (MNW) networks is crucial for their appropriate integration in many applications, including transparent electrodes for optoelectronics and <b>transparent</b> film <b>heaters.</b> We have recently highlighted the discontinuous activation of efficient percolating pathways (EPPs) for networks having densities slightly above the percolation threshold. Such networks exhibit abrupt drops of electrical resistance when thermal or electrical annealing is performed, giving rise to a “geometrically quantized percolation”. In this letter, Lock-in Thermography (LiT) is used to provide visual evidence of geometrical quantized percolation: when low voltage {{is applied to the}} network, individual “illuminated pathways” can be detected and new branches get highlighted as the voltage is incrementally increased. This experimental approach has allowed us to validate our original model and map the electrical and thermal distributions in silver nanowire (AgNW) networks. We also study the effects of electrode morphology and wire dimensions on quantized percolation. Furthermore we demonstrate that the network failure at high temperature can also be governed by a quantized increase of the electrical resistance, corresponding to the discontinuous destruction of individual pathways (anti-percolation). More generally, we demonstrate that LiT is as a promising tool for the detection of conductive sub-clusters, as well as hot spots in AgNW networks. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{conducting}} electrodes (TCEs) {{are one of}} {{the essential}} components of devices such as solar cells, and the capacitor touch sensors of smartphones. With increasing demand for these devices, the research on transparent conducting electrodes becomes a very popular topic. In this thesis TCEs are fabricated by the method of cracked template polymer and different network densities are obtained by varying the spin coating speed of the templated polymer. The degradation of silver network electrodes with high transparency (82 %) and low sheet resistance 8 Ω/□ is studied by using thermoreflectance and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thermoreflectance (TR) results show that the existence of hot spots contributes to faster breaking down of silver network electrodes. Further study on SEM images reveals the increase in grain size after constant voltage bias which is an electromigration related phenomena. The results of finite element simulation precisely pinpoint the hot spots on each network, confirming the accuracy of TR result. Finite element simulation allows us to study the current density on each silver wire within the network, showing a relatively high current density on horizontal wires than vertical wires. It suggests that the number of horizontal wires is key to increase the lifetime of silver network electrode by decreasing the current density. Potential applications of the silver network electrode such as heaters, pressure sensors, and acoustic sensors are studied. <b>Transparent</b> flexible <b>heaters</b> are successfully fabricated which can be used on thermotherapy and as a container temperature controller. This heater can heat up to 75 ̊C by applying a voltage of 5 V within 10 s.

The influence of network density, nanowire sizes, and post treatments on the properties of AgNW networks will also be evaluated.
