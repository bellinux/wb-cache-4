5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. <b>Teachers</b> <b>had</b> to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|Benavidez Elementary School, {{which opened}} on Tuesday January 21, 1992, {{relieved}} Cunningham of around 675 students and 29 teachers. Benavidez, {{along with two}} other schools, {{was a part of}} a $370 million Houston ISD school construction project, which originated from a school bond approved in March 1989. Rose Garza, the principal of Benavidez, said that the committee determining the name of the school named it after Roy P. Benavidez, a soldier in the Vietnam War who was given the Medal of Honor, because the school wanted to name the school after a Hispanic who could serve as a positive role model to the mostly Hispanic student body that occupied the school when it opened. HISD officials said that the district had little difficulty opening the three schools {{in the middle of the}} year, since the same <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> been teaching the same students while they occupied the previously overcrowded schools in the preceding fall. On its opening day Benavidez referred 400 students to other schools due to overcrowding. After Benavidez opened, Benavidez and Cunningham each had about 700 students. In 1994, Benavidez had 1,065 pupils and it had to send 200 children to different schools. As of that year, 88% of Benavidez's children were Hispanic. By 1996, both Cunningham and Benavidez became overcrowded. Gordon also became a reliever school for Benavidez and another non-Gulfton school. SER-Niños opened in 1996. In 2000 Benavidez had 1,300 students and Cunningham had 1,190 students. At the schools, the average classroom size was 30 students, exceeding the state's recommendation of 22 students per classroom.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{studies of}} Estonian VET <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> yielded similar results and shown similar tendencies. They {{indicate}} {{the relevance of}} the changes in areas such as networking and cooperation between local and international partners, enterprises and other schools. Their methods in the classroom have changed because of new technology and the implementation of e-learning (Loogma 2010). Changes in teaching, emerging from new target groups and the growing diversity of student populations (e.g. increasing numbers of students with special needs), have also brought new roles as shown in other studies (Ümarik and Rekkor 2013; Loogma 2010). <b>Teachers</b> <b>have</b> to support these students in the learning process in ways that differ from the support they offer other students in order to make sure the students stay in school (Espenberg et al. 2012). VET <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> had different experiences and attitudes regarding the national curriculum development and implementation process in their work. Therefore, some <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> adopted the changes more easily than others (Rekkor et al. 2013). Furthermore, Estonian VET <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> realised that their work requires better professional, pedagogical, social and computer skills (Loogma 2010).|$|R

Both the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the United Federation of College Teachers (UFCT) claimed the university had violated the professors' academic freedom. St. John's, the two groups said, demanded that the faculty restrict their teaching to a narrow, dogmatic approach to Thomism and required faculty to submit all articles and books to the administration for clearance before seeking publication.

25|$|As {{there had}} never been a single {{organizational}} body governing the teaching of the art, several variant styles and sub-styles developed. Although there are classical texts which include specific encoded instructions and general guidelines for practice, many of these are ignored by most modern practitioners, and interpreted in different ways by those who follow their instruction (this is depicted in the lineage chart further down this page). As a result, over the decades and especially over the last few dozen years, branches of the art have considerably differentiated and diverged.

25|$|The Derg's (1976) Proclamation No: 103 had public {{ownership}} of schools {{consistent with the}} socialist system. This still left a few private schools for children of politicians and wealthy families resulting in a higher quality of education for these children than for all others. Primary schooling expanded throughout the country with national enrolment reaching 34.1%. There were still regional disparities with more resources going to the south than to the north. Educational quality decreased with expansion largely due to resource scarcity. The Derg tried to resolve the problem of teacher shortage by recruiting 5,500 untrained teachers from those who had completed grade 12. These <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> to attend government designed summer schools for three years to obtain certification.|$|E
25|$|Practical {{difficulties}} included recruiting teachers {{by ethnic}} group rather than language ability. Consequently, some teachers {{were expected to}} teach their ethnic language even if their ability was poor while other teachers, who could speak the ethnic language, were not recruited. Teachers who could speak the local language had no training in its structure or written form. Local languages could lack standardization and their vocabularies might be too limited to cover the curriculum. Lack of dictionaries and grammar books meant that <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> no guide to {{the proper use of}} language and textbooks were the only written material to help students with reading. One solution to these problems has been to allow bilingual instruction and Amharic sections in some schools.|$|E
