5|$|Alton Brooks Parker (May 14, 1852 – May 10, 1926) was an American judge, {{best known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> who lost the presidential {{election}} of 1904 to incumbent Theodore Roosevelt in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy {{approached}} Musial about supporting Kennedy's {{campaign for}} President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy {{later that year}} and became a supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Democrat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Weaver and Chambers {{left the}} {{convention}} with {{high hopes for}} the third party's cause, {{but in the end}} they were disappointed. The election was a close contest between the Republican, James A. Garfield, and <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> Winfield Scott Hancock, with Garfield being the narrow victor. The Greenback ticket placed a distant third, netting just over three percent of the popular vote.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the last}} {{election}} in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Pennsylvania until 1936, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Illinois until 1892, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won California until 1880, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Indiana and Virginia until 1876 and the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Tennessee until 1872. This also started the long Republican trend in Vermont, which wouldn't be broken until 1964, over a century later.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the last}} {{election}} in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Tennessee until 1856, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won New Jersey until 1852, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Ohio until 1848, and the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Indiana and Georgia until 1844. This was also the only election in which Kentucky voted for the National Republicans.|$|R
50|$|The Greens {{directed}} preferences to <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Labor {{ahead of}} the Coalition, Family First and <b>the</b> Christian <b>Democrats.</b> In exchange, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> preferenced <b>the</b> Greens ahead of both major parties and Labor preferenced <b>the</b> Greens and <b>Democrats</b> first in every state and territory except for Tasmania, where Labor preferenced Family First ahead of <b>the</b> Greens and <b>Democrats,</b> and Victoria, where Labor preferenced Family First, Democratic Labor and <b>the</b> Christian <b>Democrats</b> ahead of <b>the</b> Greens and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|R
5|$|For Register of Wills, as for City Controller, the Republicans had {{a primary}} fight between the Hamilton-Meade regulars and the Meehan faction. As in that contest, the regulars were victorious, nominating Robert C. Duffy, {{attorney}} and former football star, with 67,283 votes. In second came Meehan's man, Morris J. Root, with 42,977, and William P. Shermer, an independent candidate, with 8,909. The Democrats had {{an easier time}} nominating former Congressman Francis R. Smith, who trounced Joseph F. Amodie, 40,582 to 5,470. The general election contest {{was one of the}} closest on the ballot but the Republican, Duffy, still defeated <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> by more than 7,500 votes.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's special {{election}} victory in 2010 {{gave her the}} right to serve the rest of Clinton's second term, which ended in January 2013. Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, Gillibrand faced challenger Wendy E. Long, an attorney running on both the Republican Party and Conservative Party lines. Gillibrand was endorsed by The New York Times and <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> and Chronicle. She won the election with 72.2% of the vote, the largest victory margin for a statewide candidate in New York history, better than Schumer's 71.2% victory in 2004. She carried all counties except for two in western New York.|$|E
5|$|Greeley, in his paper, {{initially}} {{supported the}} Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, {{he supported the}} Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked hard on Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery as editor of The New-Yorker in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> election, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{split from}} <b>the</b> Progressives, re-establishing {{themselves}} {{as an independent}} party. However, Grant Gillon (the party's leader) and John Wright, both of whom opposed the split, chose not to follow <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> instead remaining with the Progressives. The Progressive Coalition became the Progressive Party after <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> left. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> chose Stephnie de Ruyter, who had been fifth on the Progressive list, as their new leader.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the last}} {{election}} in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Michigan until 1932, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio or Rhode Island until 1912, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Wisconsin until 1892, the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Connecticut until 1876 and the last in which <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won New York until 1868. It was, however, the last election in which the Democrats’ chief opponent won Kentucky until 1896, and indeed the last until 1928 in which the Democrats’ opponent obtained an absolute majority in the Bluegrass State.|$|R
50|$|Although {{registered}} Republicans outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> by 152,367 to 27,719, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{predicted that}} O'Rourke would beat Chadwick by about 5,000 votes.|$|R
5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Poe plot, Riley was dismissed from <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> so he returned to Greenfield to spend time writing poetry. Back home, he met Clara Louise Bottsford, a school teacher boarding in his father's home. They found they had much in common, particularly their love of literature. The couple began a twelve-year intermittent relationship which would be Riley's longest lasting. In mid-1878 the couple had their first breakup, caused partly by Riley's alcohol addiction. The event led Riley to make his first attempt to give up liquor. He joined a local temperance organization, but quit after a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} as mayor, leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee, Daniel A. Poling, and <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> Joseph S. Clark, Jr. Clark was a lawyer and United States Army officer who had served in World War II. Raised in an upper-class Republican family, he switched his party affiliation to the Democrats in 1928. After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia, {{he served as a}} Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Clark was known as a reformer, having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the city. Despite being slandered as a communist for his membership in the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing group, Clark was victorious.|$|E
50|$|The Republicans gained twenty-two {{seats in}} the House of Representatives, {{increasing}} their majority over <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> <b>The</b> Republicans also furthered {{a majority in the}} Senate, gaining four seats from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Democratic party {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk's consternation. In August 1957 Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the royal palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> leaders to present evidence of malfeasance in his government and inviting them to join the Sangkum. <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> leaders gave hesitant responses, and according to American historian David P. Chandler, it gave the audience {{the impression that they}} were disloyal to the monarchy. The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk's tacit approval. With the Democrats vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated to be held in March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim, and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect <b>the</b> <b>Democrat.</b> Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Youth Community of Europe.|$|E
5000|$|This was {{the last}} time that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Arizona until 1996, the last time <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming until 1964, and the last time <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Texas until 1960.|$|R

5|$|Like Daniel, most {{party members}} came from pietist churches, and most were former Republicans. Elected {{as the head}} of the Maryland branch of the party, he {{attended}} the 1884 Prohibition Party National Convention in Pittsburgh. After being selected as temporary chairman of the convention, the delegates chose Daniel to be nominated for vice president alongside the presidential nominee, John St. John. The party platform was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the alcohol problem. In the election that year, the Prohibition ticket fell far short of victory, as expected, but placed third with 1.5 percent of the vote—a marked improvement over the 0.1 percent the 1880 Prohibition candidates had received. Further, their vote total in New York—just over 25,000—was more than enough to throw the election in that state from James G. Blaine, the Republican, to Grover Cleveland, <b>the</b> <b>Democrat.</b> Because pro-temperance voters usually voted Republican, many historians credit St. John and Daniel with costing Blaine the election.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E
50|$|The Family First Party preferenced <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> and <b>the</b> Christian <b>Democrats</b> {{ahead of}} both major parties. In exchange, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> preferenced Family First ahead {{of both the}} Greens and both major parties, while <b>the</b> Christian <b>Democrats</b> also preferenced Family First highly. The Family First Party and the Coalition also preferenced each other ahead of Labor and the Greens.|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} fusion with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were {{disastrous}} to the Party in the South.

By 1898, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> used a violently racist campaign to defeat the North Carolina Populists and GOP, and in 1900 <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> ushered in disfranchisement.|$|R

5|$|The battleground {{proved to}} be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan—and <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> spent much of his time in those crucial states. The Northeast was {{considered}} most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September. By then, it was clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue. By the end of September, the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers. Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was Denver, Colorado.|$|E
