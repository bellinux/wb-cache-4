5|$|The {{ski jumping}} venue {{took place at}} Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications. The normal hill size (HS) was 100m (HS100) while the large hill size was 134m (HS134). Both hills were used for FIS ski jumping World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139m on the HS134 hill in 2004. Modifications were done to the outrun and data was {{gathered}} on the wind flow within the ski jumping area from January to March for 2006 to 2009. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich {{during the week of}} 24 September 2007, it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule, with completion in mid-December 2007. The <b>test</b> <b>event</b> for Jested took place on 8–9 February 2008. A grandstand of 10,000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time ski jumping the weekend of 9–10 February 2008. The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008, but the outrun was not affected by the event, according to Liberec mayor Jiri Kittner. On 1 February, Neumannová stated that the ski jumping events took place as scheduled. The lift to the ski jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed. The winners of the ski jumping <b>test</b> <b>event</b> at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February. An Alpen Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20–21 December 2008 to have final test procedures and infrastructure for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use. The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training. Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs {{on the side of the}} hill, mobile containers for the athletes and their service teams; and a spectator catering tent was set up.|$|E
5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic <b>Test</b> <b>Event</b> in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{previously}} hosted major sporting, {{business and}} cultural events. On the sporting front, these events included World Cups and World Championships in many Olympic sports, {{as well as}} regional championships. From July 13 to July 29, 2007, the city successfully staged the 15th and largest ever edition of the Pan American Games (over 5,650 athletes competing in 34 sports) and the accompanying Parapan American Games (over 1,150 athletes competing in 10 sports). Rio de Janeiro hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup and recently hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, just {{two years before the}} 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, which includes upgrades to security, telecommunications and tourism infrastructure. The 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup will also be organised by Brazil and used as a <b>test</b> <b>event</b> for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The proposed competition schedule spreads medals across the entire program with two peaks at the weekends, being similar to the 2008 Summer Olympics program.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} to be used in conjunction with other relevant information (e. g., progress reports, surveillance data, and census data) by HIV program managers and policy makers, HIV testing service providers, CDC Project Officers, evaluators, researchers, and others interested in the public health implications of HIV prevention program activity. HIV testing data should be utilized as a tool to learn systematically from our work, inform program practice, and more rigorously and credibly document our program progress. Finally, the ultimate goal of any data collection and utilization should be to contribute to greater program effectiveness. HIV testing data have been used at the national and local levels for HIV prevention policy, program decision-making, program monitoring, evaluation activities, research, presentations, and reports. This report provides data related to high-impact HIV prevention (specifically, HIV testing and linkage to care) and the primary goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States: 1) reduce the number of persons who become HIV infected, 2) increase access to care and improve health outcomes for persons living with HIV, and 3) reduce HIV-related health disparities, and answers the following national HIV testing monitoring and evaluation questions for CDC-funded HIV testing programs: 1. What is the total number of <b>testing</b> <b>events</b> that have been conducted? 2. What is the total number of newly identified confirmed HIV-positive <b>testing</b> <b>events</b> that have been conducted? 3. Of all preliminary and confirmed HIV-positive <b>testing</b> <b>events,</b> what percentage of persons received their test results? 4. Of all confirmed HIV-positive <b>testing</b> <b>events,</b> what was the percent distribution of persons tested by risk category? 5. For both confirmed and newly identified confirmed HIV-positive <b>testing</b> <b>events,</b> what percentages of persons were linked to HIV medical care? 6. For both confirmed and newly identified confirmed HIV-positive <b>testing</b> <b>events,</b> what percentages of persons were referred to partner services?CDC-funded HIV testing services are monitored with data reported by grantees in aggregate (e. g., tables of summary counts of information) through Annual Progress Reports (APRs) and at the individual test level through the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&E) system (e. g., data files with data on individual HIV tests). These NHM&E data, which represent a subset of all HIV testing data reported in the APRs, are submitted to CDC in a standardized format. This report includes data from all health departments for five program announcements, but primarily focuses on NHM&E test-level data. Analyses for all tables and figures in this report include NHM&E test-level data; however, Table 1 also includes aggregate-level data reported to CDC as part of an extensive data quality assurance process. This report uses NHM&E testing data received and processed by CDC as of March 2012 for HIV <b>testing</b> <b>events</b> conducted during January 1 st, 2010 to December 31 st, 2010.

25|$|Another {{concern with}} the Games was that venue {{construction}} had fallen behind. In 2009, {{two years before the}} start of the games, the athletes' village was still not under construction and the aquatics and athletics stadiums fell way behind schedule. Some venues and the athletes village were finished only a few weeks {{before the start of the}} games, including the Telcel Athletics Stadium and the beach volleyball stadium in Puerto Vallarta. This meant that not all disciplines could have a <b>test</b> <b>event</b> before the games began. Organizers guaranteed that all the sports venues being built for the games would be ready before September 2011. Many of the venues were scaled down, including the Telmex athletics stadium, which had the number of seats halved. During the election of the host city of the 2015 Pan American Games, PASO president Mario Vázquez Rana said that if Guadalajara did not address the delays, Toronto, the host of the next games, would step in and replace Guadalajara as host. In August 2011, the athletics stadium was further delayed by constant rain which prevented the installation of the track. This development put the <b>test</b> <b>event</b> scheduled for September at risk of being cancelled. Several days before the opening ceremony, the organizing committee announced that they were optimistic that the venues would be ready by the start of the games.|$|E
