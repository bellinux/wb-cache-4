5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> these conventions have on depictions {{of sexuality and}} gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|Helium was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium {{were found in the}} natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E

5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E
5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E

25|$|In {{almost all}} cases, local {{communities}} are overwhelmingly opposed to mining {{because of its}} environmental impact on their livelihoods. An example are conflicts witnessed in Piura Province since 1993. A Canadian mining company departed shortly after a local referendum in Tambogrande in which over 93% voted against mining. When another company began exploration in Ayabaca and Huancabamba, this elicited new conflicts and a referendum held in September 2007, in which again over 90% of voters voted against mining. One of the main concerns of local and downstream communities relates to <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> the mine would have on water quality and quantity.
