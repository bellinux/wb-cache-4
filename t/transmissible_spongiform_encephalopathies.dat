5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} {{developed}} in mice may {{provide insight into}} providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E

500|$|During the 1960s, two London-based researchers, {{radiation}} biologist Tikvah Alper and biophysicist John Stanley Griffith, {{developed the}} hypothesis that some <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> are caused by an infectious agent consisting solely of proteins. Earlier investigations by E. J. Field into scrapie and kuru had identified the transfer of pathologically inert polysaccharides that only become infectious in the host. Alper and Griffith wanted {{to account for the}} discovery that the mysterious infectious agent causing the diseases scrapie and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease resisted ionizing radiation. [...] (A single ionizing [...] "hit" [...] normally destroys an entire infectious particle, and the dose needed to hit half the particles depends {{on the size of the}} particles.
