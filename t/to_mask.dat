5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available. These are used alone {{to provide a}} pleasant background noise and <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional background music.

40|$|The {{amygdala}} has a {{key role}} in automatic non-conscious processing of emotions. Highly salient emotional stimuli elicit amygdala activity, and happy faces are among the most rapidly perceived facial expressions. In backward masking paradigms, an image is presented briefly and then masked by another stimulus. However, reports of amygdala responses <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> happy faces have been mixed. In the present Study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine amygdala activation <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Masked happy faces elicited greater amygdala activation bilaterally as compared <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> sad faces. Our findings indicate that the amygdala is highly responsive to non-consciously perceived happy facial expressions. (JINS, 2010, 16, 383 - 387. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} prime frequency effect of masked affective stimuli on effort-related cardiovascular response. Cardiovascular reactivity was recorded during a baseline period and an attention task in which either 1 / 3, 2 / 3, or 3 / 3 {{of the trials}} included the presentation of masked emotional facial expressions (sad vs. happy). In the resting trials participants were exposed <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> neutral expressions. As expected, and replicating previous findings (Gendolla and Silvestrini, in press), participants in the 1 / 3 priming condition showed stronger systolic blood pressure reactivity – indicating more effort – when they were exposed <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> sad faces than when they were exposed <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> happy faces. This effect disappeared in the 2 / 3 and 3 / 3 conditions. Findings are interpreted as demonstrating habituation effects of masked affective stimuli on effort mobilization...|$|R

5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form.

In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E

5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much they liked it. For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 {{was chosen as the}} upper limit <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1 if they disliked the number very much, to 6 if they liked it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E
5|$|From July to October 1948 in Antananarivo, the French {{organized}} a large public {{trial of the}} uprising, charging 77 officials of the MDRM. The French authorities claimed that MDRM appeals for calm immediately prior to the outbreak of violence had been a diversion tactic <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> their involvement in organizing the rebellion, which the French alleged was secretly launched by way of an encoded MDRM telegram. Deputies Ravoahangy and Rabemananjara were arrested and imprisoned on 12 April 1947, followed two months later by Raseta (who was in Paris when the Uprising began), in violation {{of their right to}} diplomatic immunity. Debates about the Malagasy Uprising in the French National Assembly on 1 August 1947 concluded with the decision to revoke this immunity for all three deputies, who were tortured in prison.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{tested the}} hypothesis that exposure <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> emotional expressions during the performance of cognitive tasks influences effort mobilization. In support of the predictions, participants who processed masked sad faces during task performance under “do your best” instructions showed stronger sympathetic nervous system discharge to the heart (shorter pre-ejection period, higher systolic blood pressure) than participants who were exposed <b>to</b> <b>masked</b> smiling faces or angry faces. Assessed task appraisals suggest that these effects on effort-related cardiovascular reactivity occurred because the masked emotional stimuli influenced the level of experienced task difficulty. The findings are compatible {{with the effects of}} consciously experienced affect on effort-related cardiovascular response...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{protect a}} {{cryptographic}} algorithm against Differential Power Analysis, a general method consists in masking all intermediate data with a random value. When a cryptographic algorithm combines boolean operations with arithmetic operations, {{it is then}} necessary to perform conversions between boolean masking and arithmetic masking. A very efficient method was proposed by Louis Goubin in [6] to convert from boolean <b>masking</b> <b>to</b> arithmetic <b>masking.</b> However, the method in [6] for converting from arithmetic <b>to</b> boolean <b>masking</b> is less efficient. In some implementations, this conversion can be a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm to convert from arithmetic <b>masking</b> <b>to</b> boolean <b>masking.</b> Our method {{can be applied to}} encryption schemes such as IDEA and RC 6, and hashing algorithms such as SHA- 1. ...|$|R

5|$|In Greco-Roman times saffron {{was widely}} traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their {{customers}} {{ranged from the}} perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.|$|E
5|$|Machinima {{productions}} {{can remain}} {{close to their}} gaming roots and feature stunts or other portrayals of gameplay. Popular genres include dance videos, comedy, and drama. Alternatively, some filmmakers attempt to stretch {{the boundaries of the}} rendering engines or <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> the original 3-D context. The Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes exemplary productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Jagex, have sponsored contests involving it.|$|E

Nevertheless, the plague still manages to spread to various nations by human trafficking, refugees and the black market organ trade.
