5|$|As the {{reputation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated {{a great deal of}} interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E

5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over {{large areas of the}} Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms.

5|$|Felix {{is finally}} able to explain to Isaac why Alchemy's release is a {{necessary}} thing for everyone, and that Saturos and Menardi were aiming for this goal merely {{for the sake of}} the survival of their home colony of Prox to the far north, located near <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Lighthouse. He also reveals that his parents and Isaac's father are alive and currently being held hostage in Prox in order to coerce Felix's initial cooperation. Isaac and his company agree to aid Felix, and the group sets out north to activate <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Lighthouse. The group discovers that Karst and Agatio have been transformed into mindless dragons and are forced to defeat them - they return <b>the</b> <b>Mars</b> Star before succumbing to their wounds. When they reach the tower's top, the Wise One, the entity responsible for originally tasking Isaac to prevent the breaking of Alchemy's seal, confronts them. He warns them that mankind could very well destroy Weyard themselves if they had possession of such a power, and when Isaac insists on breaking the seal regardless the Wise One summons a giant, three-headed dragon for the party to battle in the final struggle. After slaying the dragon, the party of Adepts finish their objective and activate Mars Lighthouse; with all four towers across Weyard lit, the process that heralds the return of the force of Alchemy to Weyard ensues at the mountain sanctum Mt. Aleph. Alex is there, however; he took advantage of everyone else's quests so that he would gain immense power for himself from the light of the Golden Sun, a manifestation of Alchemy itself. However, he discovers that the Wise One had taken steps to prevent this and is left to die as the mountain collapses and sinks into the ground with him still on it.|$|E
50|$|The schism {{and birth}} of Mar Thoma Syrian Church, made earnestness and spiritual fervor in the leaders, lay and {{clerical}} alike. <b>The</b> <b>Mar</b> Thoma syrians lost their temporal claim to properties {{and had to}} start from scratch;Building churches and organizing themselves as an independent church body.

40|$|<b>The</b> multiple-antibiotic {{resistance}} (<b>mar)</b> locus (min 34) regulates {{a resistance}} to chloramphenicol in Escherichia coli {{that does not}} involve acetyltransferase.

This efflux was not altered by a 39 -kb chromosomal deletion which included <b>the</b> <b>mar</b> locus. Nevertheless, mutations at <b>the</b> <b>mar</b> locus led to a stronger net chloramphenicol efflux.

A total of 751 polychaete specimens and 133 species were identified from megacorer samples collected at four MAR sites (48 – 54 °N, depth: 2500 – 2800 m) sampled during the RRS James Cook 48 cruise in the summer of 2010. Polychaetes were the most abundant member of the macrofaunal community, and there was no significant difference in polychaete abundance, biomass and diversity between any of <b>the</b> <b>MAR</b> sites. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>MAR</b> did not appear to provide a physical barrier to the distribution of bathyal polychaetes either side of the ridge...|$|R
