5|$|The San Diego Surf of the American Basketball Association {{is located}} in the city. The annual Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament (formerly <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> Invitational) on the PGA Tour occurs at Torrey Pines Golf Course. This course was also the site of the 2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship. The San Diego Yacht Club hosted the America's Cup yacht races three times during the period 1988 to 1995. The amateur beach sport Over-the-line was invented in San Diego, and the annual world Over-the-line championships are held at Mission Bay every year.|$|E
50|$|Carter {{could not}} eclipse Brayton's one-lap track record, but his run was more consistent, and his four-lap average of 212.533 mph was faster overall than Brayton. Carter {{clinched}} the pole position, and completed a 1-2 sweep for <b>the</b> <b>Buicks</b> on <b>the</b> starting grid. Only a half-hour had passed, but <b>the</b> <b>Buicks</b> had firmly established their dominance of time trials, and distanced {{themselves from the}} rest of the competition. After the record-setting run, Brayton picked up the sponsorship of Hardee's during the week.|$|R

Derek sent the tape to Alan McGee and Andrew {{convinced}} Kid Dynamo to learn <b>The</b> <b>Buicks</b> songs over five rehearsals, when he heard that Derek had arranged a London showcase with a top London record label.|$|R
2500|$|From 1951 to 1953 the Riviera {{designation}} {{was given}} to the existing long wheelbase versions of <b>the</b> four-door <b>Buick</b> Roadmaster and Super sedans. <b>The</b> 1951–53 <b>Buick</b> Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans feature more standard features, more plush interior trim and, most significantly, a wheelbase (and overall length) that is [...] longer than a regular Buick Roadmaster or Super four-door sedan. <b>The</b> 1951–52 <b>Buick</b> Super four-door Riviera sedan is still [...] shorter in wheelbase and length than <b>the</b> regular <b>Buick</b> Roadmaster and [...] shorter than the Roadmaster four-door Riviera sedan. In 1953, with the move from the Fireball straight-eight to the more compact Nailhead V8 engine, the Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans became the same length.|$|R
5|$|From the onset, {{parent company}} General Motors was {{interested}} in incorporating a left-hand drive Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> XP2000 concept car in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden {{to enter into a}} range of left-hand export markets. Thus began the Commodore's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history. It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Sales of the Monaro {{began in}} 2003 to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe. Later on that year, a {{modified}} version of the Monaro began selling in the United States (but not Canada) as the Pontiac GTO, and under the Monaro name through Vauxhall dealerships in the United Kingdom. This arrangement continued through to 2005 when the car was discontinued. The long-wheelbase Statesman sales in the Chinese market as <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> Royaum began in 2005, before being replaced in 2007 by the Statesman-based Buick Park Avenue. Statesman/Caprice exports to South Korea also began in 2005. These Korean models were sold as the Daewoo Statesman, and later as the Daewoo Veritas from 2008. Holden's move into international markets has been profitable; export revenue increased from A$973million in 1999 to just under $1.3billion in 2006.|$|E

50|$|From 1951 to 1953 the Riviera {{designation}} {{was given}} to the existing long wheelbase versions of <b>the</b> four-door <b>Buick</b> Roadmaster and Super sedans. <b>The</b> 1951-53 <b>Buick</b> Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans feature more standard features, more plush interior trim and, most significantly, a wheelbase (and overall length) that is 4 in longer than a regular Buick Roadmaster or Super four-door sedan. <b>The</b> 1951-52 <b>Buick</b> Super four-door Riviera sedan is still 0.75 in shorter in wheelbase and length than <b>the</b> regular <b>Buick</b> Roadmaster and 4.75 in shorter than the Roadmaster four-door Riviera sedan. In 1953, with the move from the Fireball straight-eight to the more compact Nailhead V8 engine, the Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans became the same length.|$|R

25|$|Changes were {{relatively}} few over the Century's nine-year run. <b>The</b> all-new <b>Buick</b> LaCrosse replaced both the Century and Regal in 2005.

25|$|The LeSabre {{nameplate}} {{made its}} first appearance on the 1951 Le Sabre show car, which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> Special. <b>The</b> <b>Buick</b> LeSabre was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its station wagon variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{previous}} model, the WM is exported to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Caprice since 2007.

25|$|The {{big-block}} 455 {{was gone}} forever. The base engine was now <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> 350 with a 4-barrel carburetor until 1979. The Oldsmobile 403 was optional from 1977 to 1979. Oldsmobile's 350 diesel {{was added to}} the option list beginning in 1980, along with an Oldsmobile-sourced 307. <b>The</b> <b>Buick</b> 350 was now optional, with the base engine being <b>the</b> <b>Buick</b> 4.1 L V6 for improved fuel economy. In 1981, the then-optional Buick 350 was dropped. That same year, the Electra gained the new THM200-4R automatic transmission, which featured a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Electra could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range.|$|E
