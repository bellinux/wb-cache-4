In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time.

25|$|Takeover paper. Convertibles have a {{place as}} the {{currency}} used in takeovers. The bidder can offer a higher income on a convertible than the dividend yield on a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend yield on all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower the yield on the bidder’s shares, <b>the</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the bidder to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover. In the 1980s, UK domestic convertibles accounted for about 80pct of the European convertibles market, and over 80pct of these were issued either as takeover currency or as funding for takeovers. They had several cosmetic attractions.|$|E

[...] The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character is a very good person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in [...] "Puss in Boots") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment.|$|E
500|$|De Lucía was {{influenced}} primarily by Niño Ricardo, a leading {{figure in the}} history of flamenco guitar, and Sabicas, {{regarded as one of the}} most influential musicians involved in the development and refinement of the flamenco guitar as a concert instrument at a time when the guitar was considered an instrument meant to merely accompany a singer. Sabicas was a mentor to Paco in developing his flamenco guitar technique, as well in honing Paco's skills as a composer, characterized by melodic structure, rhythmic and harmonic, perfectly consistent from beginning to end, and non-lyrical phrased guitar falsetas when the singer stops singing. Esteban de Sanlúcar and Mario Escudero were also major influences on him and sources of inspiration. According to biographer Pohren, de Lucía was [...] "fascinated with jazz" [...] and held a deep respect for high-tech jazz musicians, regarding Di Meola, McLaughlin, Coryell and Corea as highly as musicians as he did his flamenco mentors. Despite these influences, according to the Jazz Times, [...] "Most flamenco fans can trace the music's history to either Before Paco or After Paco." [...] In 2004 interview with El País he said [...] "I have always found that the more technique you have <b>the</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to express yourself. If you lack technique you lose the freedom to create." [...] Like many other flamenco guitarists he often played a Hermanos Conde guitar and had his own signature model, but had a range of guitars in his collection.|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} the low {{threshold}} {{is a point of}} Donetsk psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth. In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements. They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself. The dissidents regard the cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being. The more such cases, <b>the</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to present their personal ill-being [...] as public one. They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society. Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding [...] "public well-being" [...] as personal one. The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place. The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members. After reading the book Institute of Fools by Viktor Nekipelov, Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.|$|E

This indicates that the more oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, <b>the</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for more oxygen to bind - until all binding sites are saturated. In addition, Bohr noticed that increasing CO2 pressure shifted this curve to the right - i.e. higher concentrations of CO2 make it more difficult for hemoglobin to bind oxygen. This latter phenomenon, together with the observation that hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases with increasing pH, is known as the Bohr effect.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{elements}} of game design, {{areas such as}} gameplay, mechanics, and similar features {{have been described as}} gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player. Gamers of both genders tend to crave realism and the more realistic the gender of the character, <b>the</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for a player to identify with the character. A 2009 academic study published in New Media & Society, however, found that 85% of playable characters in video games are male. Erin Hamilton argues that part of the problem comes from the difficulty in [...] "juxtaposing femininity and feminism in a good video game." [...] When female characters do appear in video games, they are often regarded as presenting unhealthy messages concerning unrealistic body images and provocative sexual and violent behaviors for players of both genders. Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) to think that this is how girls are supposed to look and act. Furthermore, over-sexualized depictions of scantily clad female video game characters such as Tomb Raiders Lara Croft are not appealing to some girls.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film has}} been both criticized and praised for its {{handling}} of subject matter, including the portrayal of harsh interrogation techniques, commonly classified as torture. The use of these techniques was long kept secret by the Bush administration. (See Torture Memos.) Glenn Greenwald, in The Guardian, stated that the film takes a pro-torture stance, describing it as [...] "pernicious propaganda" [...] and stating that it [...] "presents torture as its CIA proponents and administrators see it: as a dirty, ugly business {{that is necessary to}} protect America." [...] Critic Frank Bruni concluded that the film appears to suggest [...] "No waterboarding, no Bin Laden". Jesse David Fox writes that the film [...] "doesn't explicitly say that torture caught bin Laden, but in portraying torture as one part of the successful search, it can be read that way." [...] Emily Bazelon said, [...] "The filmmakers didn't set out to be Bush-Cheney apologists", but [...] "they adopted a close-to-the-ground point of view, and perhaps they're in denial about how far down the path to condoning torture this led them." [...] Journalist Michael Wolff slammed the film as a [...] "nasty piece of pulp and propaganda" [...] and Bigelow as a [...] "fetishist and sadist" [...] for distorting history with a pro-torture viewpoint. Wolff disputed the efficacy of torture and the claim that it contributed to the discovery of bin Laden. In an open letter, social critic and feminist Naomi Wolf criticized Bigelow for claiming the film was [...] "part documentary" [...] and speculated over the reasons for Bigelow's [...] "amoral compromising" [...] of film-making, suggesting that the more pro-military a film, <b>the</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to acquire Pentagon support for scenes involving expensive, futuristic military equipment. Wolf likened Bigelow to the acclaimed director and propagandist for the Nazi regime, Leni Riefenstahl, saying: [...] "Like Riefenstahl, you are a great artist. But now you will be remembered forever as torture's handmaiden." [...] Author Karen J. Greenberg wrote that [...] "Bigelow has bought in, hook, line, and sinker, to the ethos of the Bush administration and its apologists" [...] and called the film [...] "the perfect piece of propaganda, with all the appeal that naked brutality, fear, and revenge can bring". Peter Maass of The Atlantic said the film [...] "represents a troubling new frontier of government-embedded filmmaking".|$|E

The series we have used is Two and a half men, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, How I met Your Mother and Friends. Our material consists of clips from four American sitcoms (situational comedy). The method consists of a web survey of ordinary viewers and analysis of responses and clips (parts of episodes). To our help, we have used previous research on sitcoms and the programs' own websites. The results show that many viewers thinks the laugh interferes even if it comes from a live audience, it also shows that the series which has a high factor of recognition was <b>easier</b> for <b>the</b> audience to understand. <b>The</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for <b>the</b> viewer to identify themselves with a character or situation, <b>the</b> <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for him to understand.

A higher aggradation rate is closely related to strong hydrodynamic conditions. Conversely, a lower aggradation rate with gentle or straight thalweg trajectories indicates that erosion occurs with a higher frequency.
