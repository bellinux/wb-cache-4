Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} protein on the {{absorption}} and its second derivative spectra of Cibacron Blue 3 GA (CB) {{has been investigated}} in cationic reversed micelles compared with that in buffer solution.

The anionic CB has electrostatic interactions with cationic CTAB and has affinity interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or lysozyme in <b>the</b> <b>reversed</b> micelles. <b>The</b> second derivative spectra of CB have red-shifted compared with the presence of BSA in <b>the</b> <b>reversed</b> micelles, which might indicate the decrease of the polarity of the CB microenvironment in <b>the</b> <b>reversed</b> micelles. <b>The</b> absorption maximum (lambda(m)) of CB with BSA in <b>the</b> <b>reversed</b> micelles was blue-shifted compared with that in buffer solution at pH < pI, which indicated that the affinity interaction between CB and protein is different from in reversed micelles and aqueous buffer solution.
