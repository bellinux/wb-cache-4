He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place. You'll have to put me on a pedestal, like, never mind that it's Beyoncé. I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as a man? What have I not heard her say? That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2005, ADL National Director Abraham Foxman {{called it}} hypocritical for hip-hop {{producer}} Russell Simmons to lead an ad campaign against anti-Semitism while also, according to Foxman's view, defending or excusing Louis Farrakhan's anti-Semitic statements. Later that year the ADL urged prominent black leaders including Simmons to reconsider {{their support for}} Farrakhan and Malik Zulu Shabazz organizing the Millions More Movement and to [...] "stand up" [...] against black anti-Semitism. Simmons, responding to ADL Director Abraham Foxman, said, [...] "simply put, you are misguided, arrogant, and very disrespectful of African Americans, and most importantly, your statements will unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of Jews {{in the minds of}} millions of African Americans". [...] Foxman replied, [...] "If there were a Jewish event which was led by an out-and-out racist, I would expect Black leaders <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that ADL should {{have nothing to do with}} it. And I would agree with them, rather than condemn them for their action." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{has stated}} that her stage {{forename}} ("Whoopi") was taken from a whoopee cushion; [...] "If {{you get a little}} gassy, you've got to let it go. So people used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from." [...] She said in 2011, [...] "My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name, it's part of my family, part of my heritage. Just like being black." [...] Henry Louis Gates, Jr., in his book In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past, found that all of Goldberg's traceable ancestors were African Americans, that she has no known Jewish ancestry, and that none of her ancestors were named Goldberg. Results of a DNA test, revealed in the 2006 PBS documentary African American Lives, traced part of her ancestry to the Papel and Bayote people of modern-day Guinea-Bissau. Her admixture test indicates that she is of 92% sub-Saharan African origin and of 8% European origin.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{conducted}} at ten or more London theatres, including the Lyceum Theatre, where he composed music {{for a number}} of Henry Irving's productions, including Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice. Irving's co-star, Ellen Terry, wrote in her memoir, The Story of My Life, [...] "No one was cleverer than Hamilton Clarke, Henry's first musical director, and a most gifted composer, at carrying out [...] instructions. [...] Hamilton Clarke often grew angry and flung out of the theatre, saying that it was quite impossible to do what Mr. Irving wanted. 'Patch it together, indeed!' he used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> indignantly.... 'Mr. Irving knows nothing about music, or he couldn't ask me to do such a thing.' But the next day he would return with the score altered on the lines suggested by Henry, and would confess that the music was improved. 'Upon my soul, it's better! The 'Guv'nor' was perfectly right.'" [...] He was one of the many composers recruited to write German Reed Entertainments at St. George's Hall. These included Castle Botherem: or An Irish Stew (1880), Cherry Tree Farm (1881), [...] and Nobody's Fault (1882) to texts by Arthur Law, and Fairly Puzzled (text by Oliver Brand) in 1884 and A Pretty Bequest (text by T. Malcolm Watson) in 1885. Reviews both for Clarke's music and the performances of Corney Grain {{and the rest of the}} company were excellent.|$|E
