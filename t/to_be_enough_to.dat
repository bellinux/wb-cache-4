5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E
5|$|Over time, as Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> command {{its many}} armies {{in the field}} or {{administer}} its many provinces. To solve this problem, it became normal to prorogue the authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue to command in the field. Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and the device was used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia was estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide {{is caused by a}} relatively small number of species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E

5|$|Following their four-game {{sweep of}} Milwaukee in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in two runs, while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam was all the run support starter Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs. The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed a three-run homer as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|E

25|$|Despite her {{contributions}} to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist. However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> bring about women's liberation.

25|$|Jacques Anquetil {{captured}} {{the lead of}} the 1960 Giro d'Italia after dominating the lengthy stage 14 time trial from Seregno to Lecco. Anquetil's lead shrunk because of bike issues which prevented him from countering attacks while climbing the Gavia Pass during the penultimate stage. Anquetil retained a twenty-eight second lead that proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> last to the race's finish, making him the first French winner of the Giro d'Italia. Arnaldo Pambianco captured his lone Giro victory after his efforts in a breakaway on the 1961 edition's fourteenth stage gave him the race lead.|$|E
25|$|Chris Foran {{then became}} only the fourth man to captain Park on three {{occasions}} {{as he took}} charge again for the 2010 season. An early highlight came in a home draw against Mobberley in which Ian Cooper and Australian batsman Adam Watson both scored centuries in the same innings, a record previously made almost 100 years earlier. However it ended up being another tough year as Park managed just four wins which seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep them up with a month to go.

25|$|Chelsea {{began the}} 2010–11 {{season with a}} loss to Manchester United in the Community Shield. Chelsea's Premier League season started well with wins in their opening six League games, two by a 6–0 scoreline, {{although}} a dip in form saw them fighting {{to stay in the}} top four. On 31 January, Chelsea made headlines by signing a pair of stars in the final moments of the January transfer window, David Luiz for £21.3m from Benfica and a British transfer record of £50m for Liverpool's Fernando Torres. The two signings proved not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> salvage something from Chelsea's season and they failed to win a trophy. As a result, Ancelotti was dismissed as manager shortly after Chelsea's 1–0 defeat to Everton {{on the final day of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{was always}} troubled by {{financial}} shortcomings; his income never seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sustain his large-scale goals and policies. For this {{reason he was}} forced to take substantial credits from Upper German banker families, especially from the Baumgarten, Fugger and Welser families. Jörg Baumgarten even served as Maximilian's financial advisor. The Fuggers, who dominated the copper and silver mining business in Tyrol, provided a credit of almost 1 million gulden for the purpose of bribing the prince-electors to choose Maximilian's grandson Charles V as the new Emperor. At the end of Maximilian's rule, the Habsburgs' mountain of debt totalled six million gulden, corresponding to a decade's worth of tax revenues from their inherited lands. It took {{until the end of the}} 16th century to repay this debt.|$|E

(2003) give an LD50 range of 1.0–7.75mg/kg SC. Venom yield is typically between 150–350mg, with a maximum of 750mg. Brown (1973) mentions a venom yield of 180–750mg.

500|$|In 1975, an {{apparently}} very similar species was described from the Lower Cambrian (515 to 520 million years ago) Maotianshan Shale [...] of Chengjiang, China. It was originally placed within the [...] "ostracod"-like genus Mononotella, as Mononotella ovata. In 1991, Xian-Guang Hou and Jan Bergström reclassified {{it under the}} new genus Chuandianella when additional discoveries of more complete specimens made its resemblance to W. fieldensis more apparent. Like W. fieldensis, Chuandianella ovata had a bivalved carapace with a median ridge, a pair of caudal rami, {{a single pair of}} antennae, and stalked eyes. In 2004, Jun-Yuan Chen tentatively transferred it to the genus Waptia. However, C. ovata had eight abdominal somites in contrast to five in W. fieldensis. Its limbs were biramous and were undifferentiated, unlike those of W. fieldensis. Other authors deemed these differences <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> separate it from Waptia to its own genus.|$|E

[...] The {{second half of the}} game started with two quick goals from Craig Bellamy and Kenwyne Jones to see Cardiff come back to win the game. The next game was a visit from title {{challenging}} Manchester City which Norwich were expected to lose. Norwich defended well to earn a point and could have won the game when they had a goal disallowed for offside. The following Tuesday Norwich visited West Ham where two late goals from the home side saw them slip to one point above the relegation zone. The defeat saw pressure build once more on Chris Hughton following an interview with Norwich chief executive David McNally. The next match saw champions league chasing Tottenham Hotspur visit Carrow Road where a single Robert Snodgrass goal proving <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> take the lead and a number of fine saves saw John Ruddy ensure Norwich kept their fourth home clean sheet in a row.|$|E
500|$|There {{were few}} {{clear-cut}} chances {{at the start}} of the second half, but Plymouth Argyle were winning the midfield battle with Mauge and Chris Leadbitter leading by example with a number of forceful tackles. [...] The pivotal moment arrived on 65 minutes after Martin Barlow had earnt a corner-kick on the right-hand side. Leadbitter played the ball short to full back Mark Patterson, whose well-measured cross was met firmly by the unmarked Mauge to head into the back of the net. Darlington tried to force their way back into the match, but were being thwarted by Plymouth Argyle captain Michael Heathcote and his defensive colleagues which left strikers Robbie Blake and Robbie Painter, who both scored in the semi-finals, with little to work on. As Darlington committed more players forward in search of an equaliser they left themselves exposed in defence which gave the leading side more space to launch counter-attacks. Evans and Littlejohn threatened to score the decisive second goal, but in the end Mauge's headed finish midway through the second half proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> claim the final promotion place for the team from Devon. The match was by no means a classic, with serious goalscoring chances at a premium, but to the winners it didn't matter.|$|E
