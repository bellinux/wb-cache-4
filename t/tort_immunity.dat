40|$|The {{development}} of private manned space flight is proceeding rapidly; there are proposals to launch paying passengers {{before the end}} of 2014. Given the historically dangerous nature of space travel, an accident will probably occur at some point, resulting in passengers’ injury or death. In the event of a lawsuit stemming from such an accident, a court will likely find that a space flight entity operating suborbital flights is a common carrier, while an entity operating orbital flights is not. Regardless of whether these entities are common carriers, they face a threat of high levels of liability, as well as risks stemming from an inability to obtain insurance and the escalation of tort litigation costs. Given that the private manned space flight industry is brand new and can provide many benefits to the United States and the world, it is important to protect the industry while it grows. Individual states have attempted to protect the industry by passing liability immunity statutes, but passing statutes on a state-by-state basis is insufficient to protect the industry from the liability it faces. As a result, this Note proposes a national <b>tort</b> liability <b>immunity</b> statute to shield the industry until it reaches a more advanced stage of development...|$|R
40|$|Because the {{wrongful}} life {{cause of}} action has only recently been established, new cases from other jurisdictions become important and persuasive to courts dealing with this problem for the first time. Wrongful birth cases have already been decided in Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and inevitably North Carolina will also be faced with a wrongful birth and/or a wrongful life suit. Therefore, an in depth analysis of the Turpin v. Sortini decision in relation to North Carolina law is essential to enable courts and practitioners {{to meet the challenge}} of a wrongful life suit. This {{cause of action}} must be viewed in light of traditional <b>tort</b> liability, parent-child <b>immunity,</b> and current judicial decisions reflecting the attitude that in every situation some life is not always preferable to no life at all...|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{have criticized}} the Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{qualified}} immunity decision in Pearson v. Callahan {{on the ground that}} it may lead to stagnation in the judicial elaboration of constitutional norms. Under current law, officers sued in their personal capacity for constitutional <b>torts</b> enjoy qualified <b>immunity</b> from liability unless the plaintiff can persuade the court that the conduct in question violated clearly established law. Pearson permits the lower courts to dismiss on the basis of legal uncertainty; it no longer requires the courts to address the merits of the constitutional question. 	 	This essay suggests that constitutional tort claimants should be permitted to avoid the qualified immunity defense by pursuing claims for nominal damages alone. Such nominal claims have a lengthy pedigree, both as a common law analog to the declaratory judgment, and as a remedy for constitutional violations. Because they do not threaten to impose personal liability on official defendants, nominal claims should not give rise to a qualified immunity defense. By seeking only nominal relief, litigants could secure the vindication of their constitutional rights in cases where legal uncertainty might otherwise lead to a dismissal. Such a regime would advance the acknowledged interest in maintaining a vibrant body of constitutional law without threatening to impose ruinous liability on the officials named in the complaint...|$|R

40|$|Does {{tort law}} deter risky {{behavior}} in individuals? We explore this question {{by examining the}} relationship between <b>tort</b> <b>immunity</b> and volunteering. During the 1980 s and 1990 s, nearly every state provided some degree of volunteer immunity. Congress followed with the 1997 Volunteer Protection Act. This article analyzes these acts, identifying three motivations for them: the chilling effects of tort liability, limits on liability insurance, and moral concerns. Using data from the Independent Survey’s Giving and Volunteering surveys, we then identify a large and positive correlation between immunity and volunteering. We next consider {{the implications of the}} findings for tort theory and nonprofit law...|$|E
40|$|Interspousal <b>tort</b> <b>immunity</b> {{persists}} {{de facto}} through {{the mechanism of}} private insurance, the article explains. Although interspousal <b>tort</b> <b>immunity</b> has been eliminated as a doctrinal matter, it endures as a reality. Liability insurance is inseparable from tort liability and drives the tort litigation system in this {{as well as other}} contexts. The insurance family member exclusion and the insurance intentional acts exclusion operate together to ensure that interspousal tort claims such as domestic violence tort claims will not be brought. These are reasonably considered to be gender-specific harms and the exclusion of them from tort compensation is a failing of the existing torts system. The article, which ties torts and insurance to feminist theory, was written for a conference which asked participants to explore relational feminism as articulated by scholars such as Robin West and Mary Becker. A liberal feminist critique of family member exclusions, which forbid liability coverage of claims between family members, would claim that they are based on stereotyping about relationships and collusion between family members, and that they should be abolished. A relational feminist viewpoint, which posits that individuals value community and relationships above self-interest, might at first glance provide a justification for family member exclusions. But a broader relational feminist viewpoint might support broader loss-sharing across communities with a recognition that all policyholders should, as part of valuing community and relationships, help compensate through insurance premiums those injured by intentional torts of family members. Therefore, a relational feminist viewpoint might also support their abolition...|$|E
40|$|Tort {{liability}} {{expanded in}} the twentieth century, a shift scholars generally attribute to the reorganization of tort law around the fault principle. In privileging compensation and deterrence, this reconfiguration ended various restrictions on liability, long viewed as arbitrary, including limits to the recovery for emotional harm and interspousal <b>immunities.</b> <b>Tort</b> and family law scholars alike portray the end of such immunities as a milestone for gender equality. Their elimination enables spouses and partners to secure compensation for emotional and physical abuse arising in intimate relationships. Yet, tort law is not operating in this way. On the contrary, by endorsing a family/ market distinction in private law, scholars have pushed intimate liability claims between spouses away from tort law and into family law. As a result, compensation for emotional harm is mostly actionable in tort when it occurs {{in the realm of}} the market rather than {{in the realm of the}} family. Today, intimate liability is left to the agendas of political reformers. Feminists on the left and social conservatives on the right are shaping the litigation on interspousal torts, but they have opposing political agendas. While feminists seek to create more gender equality and protect women both within and outside the marital bond, social conservatives seek to strengthen traditional family values by favoring married plaintiffs only. Both sets of reformers, however, care more about promoting their respective agendas than redressing the harm suffered by those who do not fit their stereotyped narratives. The current intimate liability regime has a class bias. Plaintiffs in upper-middle-class marriages can benefit from interspousal tort litigation, particularly during divorce proceedings, because they can pay for private liability insurance. Low- and middle-income married couples, who cannot afford such liability insurance, cannot bring these claims and instead are at the mercy of tort lawyers operating on contingency fees. Furthermore, unless litigation on emotional harm happens during the breakup of a marriage, it is almost impossible for non-married plaintiffs to recover damages. These include nonmarried partners, cohabitants, and same-sex couples. To overhaul such unequal outcomes, this paper suggests departing from a market/ family dichotomy in tort law. It advocates reconceptualizing intimate liability as a stand-alone tort remedy in order to deter abusive emotional behavior enabled by relationships in which economic and emotional dependency are deeply intertwined...|$|R

40|$|The State 2 ̆ 7 s {{immunity}} from liability for the torts of its officers and employees claims legendary status in American law. Indeed, immunity 2 ̆ 7 s history now looms as daunting as the doctrine itself. As with most epochal accounts, this history {{varies according to}} version [...] versions, assuredly, for many tastes. In sum, nevertheless, the offerings attest to a legal principle persisting as (at least) the point of departure in most jurisdictions. Anchored in both history and rationale, therefore, state <b>tort</b> <b>immunity</b> long dominated {{the law of the}} United States. Over time, indeed, the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s durability proved unequal only to that of its critics. Those critics conceded the precept of a limited sphere of legitimacy. They were unrelenting, however, in their devastating charges of doctrinal overreach. The attacks gradually took their toll, and, over the decades, various states moved in various ways to restrict their own tort immunities. Characteristic of American legal reform, there is a distinct history for each state...|$|E
40|$|Periodically {{the public}} reads {{of the injury}} of a citizen other than a state {{employee}} {{at the hands of}} a former mental patient who either escaped because of inadequate guarding or was released from a state or federal institution because of an improper release-diagnosis. The public assumes that the injured party will be reimbursed, but who will bear the burden of reimbursement? Confinement often leaves the patient judgment proof; the employee whose negligence allowed the escape is frequently judgment proof; the employee who negligently certified the release of an unrehabilitated patient is clothed with immunity from suit on his release-discretion; and in a vast majority of jurisdictions the courts are closed to tort actions against the sovereign. Realizing the inequities of the above situation, Nebraska has provided for a legislative tort claims board. In addition, bills to establish state liability in situations where the doctrine of respondeat superior would make a private employer liable for the torts of his employees have been introduced into the last two sessions of the Nebraska legislature. Both bills were defeated, but opposition was to the procedure and not the principle; and in light of the national trend, the eventual passage of a Nebraska tort liability act seems quite probable. Therefore, it is hoped that this note will provide the following: (1) an analysis of problems concerning mental hospitals, which have been experienced by other jurisdictions under their tort claims acts; acts which will serve as a pattern for legislators to follow in drafting Nebraska’s <b>tort</b> <b>immunity</b> waiver, (2) a guide for Nebraska courts which will be called upon to interpret such an immunity waiver, and (3) a guide for practitioners before and members of the present Nebraska Sundry Claims Board...|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} of powers is an institution which lies {{at the core of}} the American political system. The theory underlying this method of structuring power is that it will commonly produce conflict. On the other hand, separating powers, with each branch performing the task for which it is best prepared, can be an efficient way to structure the allocation of responsibilities in a political system. This dissertation asks which of these theoretical assumptions is most prevalent when the {{separation of}} powers is put into action. It analyzes the role of the state supreme court of Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court, in that state 2 ̆ 7 s political system. The activities of this court from the 1970 s through the 1990 s were analyzed to determine the degree to which it moved outside traditional judicial roles and then to determine how such activities are viewed by the primary policy making body in a democracy, the legislature. ^ This study found that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was involved regularly in making policy for the state through statutory interpretation and through the development of both common and constitutional law. Contrary to the widespread assumption underlying the {{separation of powers}}, however, this activity has not generated major conflict. In questions as important as the right-to-die, the death penalty, funding for abortions, and governmental <b>tort</b> <b>immunity,</b> the state 2 ̆ 7 s high court has been a major player in setting public policy for the citizens of Massachusetts, sometimes by itself and at other times in cooperation with the legislature. While there were a few challenges leading to conflict in these years, and some examples of an efficient allocation of powers leading to cooperation, the system of separated powers in Massachusetts led more frequently to avoidance of difficult political questions, happy to allow the appointed justices of the state 2 ̆ 7 s high court to lead the way. ...|$|E
40|$|All human existences are {{competing}} {{with others in}} order to meet their desires regardless that they may be good or evil. However, the way to satisfy the desires should be justifiable. Both the insured and the insurer are obliged to inform the other party of the real facts he knows himself. Therefore, the issue on insurance crime, insurance fraud is not advantageous at all to any one side in insurance contracts. No matter how noble concerning wealth and resources based on theology or morality, fraud or deception cannot be justified generally. The receipt of commercial insurance money or public health insurance money through fraudulent acts can never be justified. Strong social sanctions are needed in this case. Though there are some discussions about the issue if the Statute of Fraud applies to insurance(life insurance) in the United States, seriousness of insurance fraud(insurance crime) is widely well recognized. So Insurance fraud is dealt with severely(sometimes as felony). The developed countries such as Germany, France have severe civil or criminal punishments toward insurance fraud. In actual, insurance has had a major impact on the law of the society. Effects of liability insurance is significant on tort law as well as on contracts, negligence, and other indemnity system. The opposition to piddling <b>tort</b> <b>immunity</b> is because of the possible insurance fraud of the insureds or the insurer abusing the immunity. In the US, insurance is closely related with the rental of the house, car and other things. Korea is no longer different. Thus, righteous operation of the insurance scheme is closely related with the task of developing soundly our whole legal system. In my opinion, Korea still falls short in controlling fraud in insurance contract law, insurance business law and private investigation business law as well as criminal law. Often in the global insurance exchanges, emerges the difference between the national laws with the issue of jurisdiction. Therefore, in particular international insurance contract’s conclusion (including reinsurance), the default of controlling insurance fraud in Korea would be regarded as the mark of legal system’s flaw. Thus, the Commercial Act(Insurance contract), the Insurance Business Act, the Criminal Act and the Private investigation business law regulating the fraud should be strengthened. In addition, social ethics should be restored to suppress the fraud...|$|E
