5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was questioned}} by Fran√ßois Therrien and colleagues (2005), {{who found that}} the biting force of Carnotaurus was {{twice as high as}} that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E
5|$|While the subspecific {{status of}} the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) is {{generally}} accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies; therefore, all sub-Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies. However, a recent study revealed that lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> West-Central African lions are {{more closely related to}} North African and Asian lions than to Southern or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa, and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia.|$|E

25|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> {{the first}} {{evidence}} of the disease in South America was found in remains of the Arawak culture around 1050 BC. The most significant finding belongs to the mummy of an 8 to 10-year-old Nascan child from Hacienda Agua Sala, dated to 700 AD. Scientists were able to isolate evidence of the bacillus.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{for this}} {{expansion}} were first conceptualized in 1979 when a planning study was undertaken. However, budgetary constraints forced an early end <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> in 1981. In 1988, {{the project was}} reinstated. A study released that year recommended that Highway7 be widened to five lanes with a centre turning lane south of Carleton Place as an interim measure; this {{was carried out in}} 1993.|$|E
25|$|The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has tracked 9,351 {{accidental}} spills {{that have}} occurred since 1974. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil. 91% of the operational oil spills are small, resulting in less than 7 metric tons per spill. On the other hand, spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 metric tons.|$|E

25|$|In the CORTICUS study, {{hydrocortisone}} hastened {{the reversal}} of septic shock, but did not influence mortality, with an increased occurrence of septic shock relapse and hypernatremia. The latter findings tempered enthusiasm for the broad use of hydrocortisone in septic shock. Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> several other smaller studies showed beneficial effects of long courses of low doses of corticoid. Several factors (such as lack of statistical power due to slow recruitment) could have led a false-negative finding on mortality in the CORTICUS study; thus, more research is needed.|$|E
25|$|Another study, also {{focused on}} the mtDNA (that which is {{inherited}} through only the maternal line), revealed that the indigenous people of the Americas have their maternal ancestry traced back to a few founding lineages from East Asia, which would have arrived via the Bering strait. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> {{it is probable that}} the ancestors of the Native Americans would have remained for a time in the region of the Bering Strait, after which {{there would have been a}} rapid movement of settling of the Americas, taking the founding lineages to South America.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} methodology, the most {{elaborate}} psychological assessment of Hitler was undertaken in 2007 by a research team at the University of Colorado. This study differed from all earlier works by its open, exploratory approach. The team tested systematically which mental disorders Hitler's behavior may and {{may not have been}} indicating. It was the first Hitler pathography that was consistently empirical. The psychologists and historians reviewed passed down reports by people who knew Hitler personally, and evaluated these accounts in accordance with a self-developed diagnostic tool that allowed {{for a wide range of}} personality, clinical, and neuropsychological disturbances to be measured. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> Hitler showed obvious traits of paranoia, but also of anti-social, sadistic, and narcissistic personality disorders, and distinct traits of posttraumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|Nasutoceratops was {{assigned}} to the Centrosaurinae in 2013, in a relatively basal position. A phylogenetic analysis performed by Sampson et al. (2013) found Nasutoceratops to be the sister taxon of Avaceratops. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> the existence of Nasutoceratops would support the hypothesis of faunal separation between the north and south of Laramidia. Its clade would differ from the northern centrosaurines in the retention of long brow horns and a short nose horn, combined with developing, convergent with the Chasmosaurinae, low epiparietals. In 2016, this clade was named Nasutoceratopsini; it contains Nasutoceratops as well as ANSP 15800 (the holotype of Avaceratops), MOR 692 (previously treated as an adult specimen of Avaceratops), the newly-described CMN 8804 from the Oldman Formation, and another undescribed ceratopsian found in Malta, Montana. The cladogram from this study is reproduced below.|$|E
25|$|Many {{more studies}} {{illustrate}} the problem. One meta-study {{was conducted by}} the psychiatry department of Oxford University at Warneford Hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty surveys were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric co-morbidity. Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a prevalence of 11% for post-traumatic stress disorder. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> refugees resettled in Western countries could be about ten {{times more likely to}} have PTSD than age-matched general populations in those countries. Worldwide, tens of thousands of refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

25|$|In {{the year}} 2001, the National Automobile Dealers Association {{conducted}} a study revealing {{the average age of}} vehicles in operation in the US. The study found that of vehicles in operation in the US, 38.3% were older than ten years, 22.3% were between seven and ten years old, 25.8% were between three and six years old, and 13.5% were less than two years old. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> the majority of vehicles, 60.6%, of vehicles were older than seven years in 2001. This relatively high age of automobiles in the US might be explained by unaffordable prices for comparable new replacement vehicles and a corresponding gradual decline in sales figures since 1998. Also, many Americans own three or more vehicles. The low marginal cost of registering and insuring additional older vehicles, many of which are rarely used, could cause the study to be skewed as these vehicles are still given full weight in the statistics.|$|E
25|$|Music therapy {{finds its}} roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which {{described}} the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal {{of the study was to}} understand whether ‚Äúmusic presented according to a specific plan‚Äù influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders. Eventually, case reports in reference <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|E
