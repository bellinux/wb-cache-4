5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, {{and some of them}} had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure similar to that of <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>church.</b> He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.|$|E

40|$|An Examination of Prevalent Twenty-First Century Models of Community Engagement by <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Churches</b> Brian Odem Bellamy (ABSTRACT) This thesis {{examines}} three prevalent {{models of}} community engagement in <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> in <b>the</b> United States of America since the year 2000. It {{will contribute to}} existing scholarship by identifying theological motivations for community engagement by <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches,</b> and assessing <b>the</b> extent to which <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> address and fulfill criteria for advancing liberation delineated from three generations of scholarship in Black Theology. This shall provide theological insight into the continued social relevance of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches.</b> Existing scholarship has shown that <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> historically have engaged the oppressed communities they have served by addressing their secular and social needs {{in addition to their}} spiritual ones, with a sense of mission to affirm human dignity and advance social justice. This praxis of liberation through community engagement was necessitated by the oppressive contexts in which <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> were founded, and has continued in varied ways in tandem with shifts in social location of black people in America. <b>Black</b> <b>church</b> community initiatives have also been marked among three generations of scholars in Black Theology, who have delineated imperatives for which <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> might engage their communities to fully continue the praxis of liberation in the present. The interrelated aims of this thesis are to discover the theological motivations of <b>black</b> <b>church</b> community engagement agents, and, to consider {{the extent to which the}} community engagement initiatives of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> of <b>the</b> twenty-first century address critical theological criteria from Black Theology for advancing liberation; each of which will help to illuminate theological implications for the continued social relevance of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>churches.</b> This project requires an examination of contemporary models of <b>black</b> <b>church</b> community engagement in their own social reality. The models of community engagement that are researched are grass-roots movements where black churchpersons use non-violent direct action to advance particular social justice causes, community development corporations where churches filter grant money from the government to create economic opportunities for their local communities, and megachurch initiatives where congregations use the revenue of their large memberships to effect positive change in their communities. Local examples of each model are examined from a grounded theory approach through interviews with clergy and community workers, observations of worship and program activities, and textual analysis of bulletins, websites, and brochures...|$|R

25|$|The {{religious}} institutions of African-American Christians commonly {{are referred to}} collectively as <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>church.</b> During slavery, many slaves were stripped of their African belief systems and typically denied free religious practice, forced to become Christian. Slaves managed, however, {{to hang on to}} some practices by integrating them into Christian worship in secret meetings. These practices, including dance, shouts, African rhythms, and enthusiastic singing, remain a large part of worship in the African-American church.|$|E
25|$|The {{abolitionist}} {{movement was}} {{strengthened by the}} activities of free African-Americans, especially in <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>church,</b> who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the New Testament. African-American activists and their writings were rarely heard outside the black community; however, they were tremendously influential to some sympathetic white people, most prominently the first white activist to reach prominence, William Lloyd Garrison, who was its most effective propagandist. Garrison's efforts to recruit eloquent spokesmen led {{to the discovery of}} ex-slave Frederick Douglass, who eventually became a prominent activist in his own right.|$|E

25|$|Black preachers {{provided}} leadership, encouraged {{education and}} economic growth, and were often the primary {{link between the}} black and white communities. <b>The</b> <b>black</b> <b>church</b> established and/or maintained the first black schools and encouraged community members to fund these schools and other public services. For most black leaders, the churches always were connected to political goals of advancing the race. There grew to be a tension between black leaders from the North and people in the South who wanted to run their churches and worship in their own way.|$|E
25|$|In 1787 in Philadelphia, <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>church</b> {{was born}} out of protest and revolutionary {{reaction}} to racism. Resenting being relegated to a segregated gallery at St. George's Methodist Church, Methodist preachers Absalom Jones and Richard Allen, and other black members, left the church and formed the Free African Society. It was at first non-denominational and provided mutual aid to the free black community. Over time, Jones began to lead Episcopal services there. He led most of its members to create the African Church, in the Episcopal tradition. (Butler 2000, DuBois 1866).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>black</b> <b>church</b> in the United States {{developed}} {{out of the}} creolization of African {{spirituality and}} European-American Christianity; early members of the churches made certain stories their own. During the antebellum years, the idea of deliverance out of slavery, as {{in the story of}} Exodus, was especially important. After Reconstruction and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with Jesus, and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.|$|E

25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>church</b> have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E
25|$|Antislavery as a {{principle}} {{was far more}} than just the wish to limit the extent of slavery. Most Northerners recognized that slavery existed in the South and the Constitution did not allow the federal government to intervene there. Most Northerners favored a policy of gradual and compensated emancipation. After 1849, abolitionists rejected this and demanded that slavery end immediately and everywhere. John Brown was the only abolitionist known to have actually planned a violent insurrection, though David Walker promoted the idea. The abolitionist movement was strengthened by the activities of free African-Americans, especially in <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>church,</b> who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the New Testament.|$|E
25|$|La Rose was {{editor-in-chief}} of New Beacon Books {{until his death}} in 2006. He edited the occasional journal New Beacon Review (1968, 1985, 1986) and co-edited with Andrew Salkey the special issue of the magazine Savacou (Nos. 9/10, 1974) that provided a comprehensive anthology of black writing in Britain during the period of the Caribbean Artists Movement. La Rose published his first collection of poems, Foundations, in 1966 and his second collection, Eyelets of Truth Within Me, in 1992 (both published by New Beacon Books). His poems and essays have been widely anthologised, and his journalism was published regularly in Race Today. He co-authored Kaiso Calypso Music: David Rudder in Conversation with John La Rose in 1990. He co-produced and scripted the documentary film Mangrove Nine, about the resistance to police attacks on the popular Mangrove restaurant in the early 1970s, with the film director Franco Rosso. He produced a short film on <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Church</b> in Britain as part of a Full House BBC 2 television programme on the Caribbean arts in 1973.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} 200 years {{that black people}} were in the United States, they {{primarily}} identified themselves by their specific ethnic group (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified themselves, for example, as Ashanti, Igbo, Bakongo, or Wolof. However, when the first captives {{were brought to the}} Americas, they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique. A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>church</b> and Black English. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group. By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.|$|E
