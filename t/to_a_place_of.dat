5|$|In 756, Emperor Xuanzong {{was forced}} to flee the capital and abdicate. Du Fu, who had been away from the city, took his family <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> safety and {{attempted}} to join the court of the new emperor (Suzong), but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang'an. In the autumn, his youngest son, Du Zongwu (Baby Bear), was born. Around this time Du Fu {{is thought to have}} contracted malaria.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees. The Behunin {{family lived in}} Zion Canyon {{near the site of}} today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is {{credited}} with naming Zion, a reference <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> peace mentioned in the Bible. Two more families settled Zion Canyon {{in the next couple of}} years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the Hall are {{decorated}} with paintings of noted patrons or members of the Inn, including Nicholas Bacon and Elizabeth I. During the Second World War the Hall {{was one of those}} buildings badly damaged during the Blitz. The Treasurers' Arms and paintings had been moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> safety and were not damaged; during the rebuilding after the War they were put back in the Hall, where they remain. The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester.|$|E

50|$|The Cambridge Buddhist Association ceased <b>to</b> offer <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> {{practice}} in September 2011, when the property {{that housed the}} Zendo was sold.|$|R
50|$|In exhibitionism, {{the walk}} of shame may also refer <b>to</b> <b>an</b> exhibitionist walking in public while exposed—either {{partially}} or fully naked—and trying <b>to</b> reach <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> safety and privacy.|$|R
5|$|There was cinema in Northallerton from 1939 until 1995. The Lyric, in the High Street, {{opened in}} October 1939 and {{also served as}} a theatre, with a {{capacity}} of 1,000 seats. It fell into disrepair and eventually closed in June 1995. The building was then bought by the New Life Baptist Church and converted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> worship.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E
5|$|Whisked {{away from}} her home and her beloved, Sue is in despair until Hal appears outside her window with a ladder. The {{attempted}} elopement fails when the mistress catches Hal in the act and dismisses him. She awaits Sue to descend and round the corner before halting her and forcing her back inside. The father pulls up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> business and Hal, who is walking by, attempts to greet the father. The angry father ignores him, but Hal turns and sees the wigmaker's store next to him. An idea strikes him and he pays a photographer to get {{a photo of the}} father on the way out, which further angers him. Hal then sends a message to Sue, that he will come and claim her the following day, disguised as her father.|$|E

50|$|Designed <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> leisure, {{between the}} seaside and a forest full of game for hunting, the castle's first logis seigneurial (seigniorial house) {{dates from the}} {{beginning}} of the 13th century.|$|R
5|$|In both {{of these}} instances, a failed retreat by Hybrida and his cavalry led to his unit being {{absolutely}} defeated and any plunder accrued during the attack was forfeited back to the natives. This lack of success, rather than the extortion of the provincials, drew {{the attention of the}} Senate who threatened to recall and prosecute Hybrida for his mismanagement of the province. In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly replaced by Gaius Octavius as the Governor of Macedonia and in March of 59 BC, during the consulship of Caesar and Marcus Culpurnius Bibulus, was prosecuted for the mishandling of the governorship by Caesar and Crassus. In the end, Hybrida was tried by Marcus Caelius Rufus for his participation in the Catilinarian conspiracy and by Lucius Caninius Gallus for his crimes in Macedonia. He was defended by Cicero, not out of duty but as a protest against the current state of affairs in Rome. Despite this, Hybrida was found guilty of his crimes, ordered to pay a fine and be banished from Rome <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> his choosing. Hybrida had settled upon Cephallenia as his residence for the duration of his exile.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} mode (Johnson's third), {{migration}} takes place <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> hibernation or aestivation where they undergo diapause {{and the same}} generation survives to return.

50|$|Hainichen used <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> {{considerable}} industry. Its primary manufacture {{was once}} that of flannels, baize, and similar fabrics; {{at the time}} it may have been called the centre of this industry in Germany.|$|R
50|$|During 70s and 80s, at {{the peak}} of {{communal}} unrest, this village did not experience any upsurge in crime. Overall this village may be considered <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> safe living, if recent instances are ignored.|$|R
25|$|Diver rescue, {{following}} an accident, {{is the process}} of avoiding or limiting further exposure to diving hazards and bringing a diver <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> safety where the diver cannot drown, such as a boat or dry land, where first aid can be administered and from which professional medical treatment can be sought.|$|E
25|$|The EMD (Granada) Walthamstow , a {{landmark}} Grade II listed cinema building (formerly the Granada) with connections to Alfred Hitchcock in Hoe Street closed in 2003 {{when it was}} sold to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG) which sought permission {{for a change of}} use <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> worship.|$|E
25|$|In Sunni {{accounts}} {{during one}} such attack, two discs from Abu Bakr's shield penetrated into Muhammad's cheeks. Abu Bakr went {{forward with the}} intention of extracting these discs but Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah requested he leave the matter to him, losing his two incisors during the process. In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr, along with other companions, led Muhammad <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> safety.|$|E
50|$|Located on the Eastern {{route of}} El Camino Viejo, {{the place was}} used as a hideout for horse thieves during Spanish and Mexican rule, and {{continued}} <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> relative safety for outlaws during American rule.|$|R
50|$|According to today's stereotype, earlier middle-class Americans {{wanted the}} home <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> {{stability}} in <b>an</b> uncertain world. <b>To</b> this mentality are attributed strongly-defined gender roles, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> minority {{reaction in the}} form of the free-love movement.|$|R
50|$|Georges Duhamel and Vildrac {{settled in}} Créteil, {{just to the}} {{southeast}} of Paris, {{in a house in}} a park-like setting along the Marne River. Their aim was <b>to</b> establish <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> freedom and friendship favourable for artistic and literary creativity.|$|R
25|$|Another {{and related}} theme {{is that of}} prophecy. The main point of the prophetic stories is that God's prophecies are always {{fulfilled}}, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future. The implication, the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> honour in Babylon in the closing scenes of the book, is that the promise of an eternal Davidic dynasty is still in effect, and that the Davidic line will be restored.|$|E
25|$|For {{distinguished}} {{devotion to}} duty, extraordinary courage and disregard {{for his own}} personal safety during {{the attack on the}} Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941. While at the side of his Captain on the bridge, Miller, despite enemy strafing and bombing and {{in the face of a}} serious fire, assisted in moving his Captain, who had been mortally wounded, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> greater safety, and later manned and operated a machine gun directed at enemy Japanese attacking aircraft until ordered to leave the bridge.|$|E
25|$|A lesser-known part of Culshaw's {{work was}} writing fiction. He {{published}} two novels {{in the early}} 1950s; the first, The Sons of Brutus (1950) had been inspired by {{what he had seen}} during trips to ruined German cities {{in the aftermath of the}} war. It was chosen by The Observer as one of its books of the year in 1950. At the time of its publication he was working on a second novel. He gave it the title A Harder Thing, but was persuaded by his publisher to change it <b>to</b> <b>A</b> <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> Stone. It was published in 1951.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 Christ Church ceased <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> Anglican {{worship and}} became St George's Cathedral. With St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate in the City of London {{it is one}} of two Antiochan churches in London. A new roof was built in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Recent retail, {{restaurants}} and other commercial establishments near the Manthope in the Arcot road of Alwarthirunagar {{has made the}} area a well sophisticated and busy place. Aavin Junction is proving <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> recreation for the locals here.|$|R
50|$|Labelled a Cultural Encounter Centre since 2003, Ambronay is <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where {{culture is}} {{accessible}} <b>to</b> everyone, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> open exchange.

25|$|The American {{position}} had hardened {{with news}} of the murder and it was ascertained that the PLO did not have plans to try the terrorists, rather they were being flown <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> asylum. It was further discovered that the negotiator Abbas had actually been the mastermind behind the hijacking. This discovery also threw Arafat's claims of authority within a fractious PLO into question for the Americans and raised questions of his own culpability. Reagan viewed Egypt's allowing the terrorists safe passage to asylum as an unfriendly act when he had ordered the US Military to intercept the Egyptian plane.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{during the}} Ottoman era, the Great Mosque of Beersheba was built with {{donations}} {{collected from the}} Bedouin residents in the Negev. It was used actively as a mosque until the city fell to Israeli forces in 1948. The mosque was used until 1953 as the city's courthouse. From then until the 1990s, when it was closed for renovations, the building housed an archeological museum, which the city intended to turn into the archeological branch of the Negev Museum. In 2011, however, the Supreme Court of Israel, sitting as the High Court of Justice, ordered the property to {{be turned into a}} museum of Islam without reverting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> worship.|$|E
25|$|Non-refoulement is {{the right}} not to be {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The right to non-refoulement is distinct from the right to asylum. In order to respect the right to asylum states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to non-refoulement by guaranteeing refugees three procedural rights (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution. This proposal attempts {{to strike a balance}} between the interest of national governments and the interests of refugees.|$|E
50|$|The Reverend Charles Harris Diversionary Centre {{is located}} on Abbatoir Road.

50|$|In 1222 Count Henry of Schwerin {{returned}} from a crusade with a reliquary of the Holy Blood, an alleged drop of Christ's blood contained in a jewel. This {{was placed in the}} cathedral, and caused it <b>to</b> become <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> pilgrimage.|$|R
50|$|Membership was 564 in 1907 and {{remained}} at 330 in 1954. Ebenezer's last minister was R.O. Thomas, who served from 1961 until 1986. The chapel remained active into the twenty first century and ceased <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> worship in April 2009.|$|R
