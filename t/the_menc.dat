In 116 asplenic patients, antibody concentrations (IgG) were measured against meningococcal serogroup C before and after immunisation. Of MenC-specific IgG, both antibody avidity and subclasses of IgG 1 and IgG 2 were determined. <b>The</b> mean <b>MenC</b> IgG concentration rose from 0. 16  μg/mL prior to vaccination to 3. 69  μg/mL 3  weeks post-vaccination, with 67 % of patients reaching the threshold of ≥ 2. 0  μg/mL. The mean IgG concentration at 35  weeks post-vaccination was 3. 10  μg/mL. IgG 2 concentrations increased more than IgG 1. Marginal avidity maturation was seen. Hypo-responders to <b>the</b> first <b>MenC</b> vaccine (IgG anti-MenC[*]≤[*] 2. 0  μg/mL) were offered a booster dose. After revaccination, 59 % reached the chosen IgG threshold.

In asplenic patients, the quantity and quality of antibodies produced after one dose of conjugated MenC vaccination is lower than that observed in previous studies in healthy adults.

40|$|The poly(glycidyl methacrylate) -modified {{magnetite}} nanoparticles, Fe 3 O 4 -PGMA NPs, {{were investigated}} and applied in nondestructive flaw detection of polymeric materials in this research. The Fe 3 O 4 endowed magnetic property to the materials for flaw detection while the PGMA promoted colloidal stability and prevented particle aggregation. The magnetite nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 NPs) were successfully synthesized by coprecipitation and then surface-modified with PGMA to form PGMA-modified Fe 3 O 4 NPs by both grafting-from and grafting-to approaches. For the grafting-from approach, the Fe 3 O 4 NPs were surface-functionalized with α-bromo isobutyryl bromide (BIBB) to form BIB-modified Fe 3 O 4 NPs (Fe 3 O 4 -BIB NPs) with covalent linkage. The resultant Fe 3 O 4 -BIB NPs {{were used as}} surface-initiators to grow PGMA by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). For the grafting-to approach, the Fe 3 O 4 NP were surface-functionalized with (3 -mercaptopropyl) triethoxysilane (MCTES) to form MCTES-modified Fe 3 O 4 NPs (Fe 3 O 4 -MCTES NPs). The PGMA with Br-end group was pre-synthesized by ATRP and then was grafted {{to the surface of}} the Fe 3 O 4 -MCTES NPs by coupling reaction. Both bare and modified Fe 3 O 4 NPs exhibited superparamagnetism and the existence of iron oxide in the form of Fe 3 O 4 was confirmed. The particle size of individual Fe 3 O 4 NPs was about 8 – 24 nm but they aggregated to form clusters. The PGMA-modified NPs formed stable dispersion in chloroform and had larger cluster sizes than the unmodified ones because of the PGMA polymer layer. However, the uniformity of the NP clusters could be improved with PGMA surface grafting. The PGMA surface layer of the grafting-from (Fe 3 O 4 -gf-PGMA) NPs was thin and dense while that of the grafting-to (Fe 3 O 4 -gt-PGMA) NPs was thick and loose. The hydrodynamic diameters (Zave) of Fe 3 O 4 -gf-PGMA NP clusters could be controlled between 176 to 643 nm, dependent on the PGMA contents and reaction conditions. During SI-ATRP, side reactions happened and caused NP aggregation as well as increase of size of NP clusters. However, the aggregation has been minimized through optimization of reaction conditions. Oppositely, Zave values of Fe 3 O 4 -gt-PGMA NPs had little variation of about 120 – 190 nm. And the PGMA content of the Fe 3 O 4 -gt-PGMA NPs was limited to 12. 5 % because of the spatial hindrance during grafting process. The saturation magnetization (Ms) of the unmodified Fe 3 O 4 NPs was about 77 emu/g, while those of the grafting-from and grafting-to Fe 3 O 4 -PGMA NPs were 50 – 66 emu/g and 63 – 70 emu/g, respectively. For Fe 3 O 4 -PGMA NPs with similar Fe 3 O 4 contents, the grafting-to NPs had slightly higher Ms than the grafting-from counterparts. In addition, the Ms of both kinds of the Fe 3 O 4 -PGMA NPs with higher Fe 3 O 4 content (> 87 %) were also higher than that of the fluidMAG-Amine, the commercially available amine-modified MNPs. Besides, both kinds of Fe 3 O 4 -PGMA NPs also had much higher Fe 3 O 4 contents and Ms values than most of the reported PGMA-modified MNPs. The magnetic epoxy nanocomposites (MENCs) were prepared by blending the modified Fe 3 O 4 NPs into bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) -based epoxy system and the distributions of both kinds of the PGMA-modified NPs were much better than that of the oleic acid-modified Fe 3 O 4 NPs. Similar to <b>the</b> NPs, <b>the</b> <b>MENCs</b> also exhibited superparamagnetism. By cross-section TEM observation, the grafting-to Fe 3 O 4 -PGMA NPs formed more homogeneous distributions with smaller cluster size than the grafting-from counterparts and gave higher Ms of <b>the</b> <b>MENCs.</b> Nondestructive flaw detection of surface and sub-surface defects could be successfully achieved by brightness contrast of images given through eddy current testing (ET) method, which is firstly reported. The mechanical properties of the materials were influenced very slightly when 2. 5 % or lower Fe 3 O 4 -gt-PGMA NPs were present while the presence of the Fe 3 O 4 -gf-PGMA NPs (1 – 2. 5 %) gave mild improvement of the storage modulus and increase of the glass-rubber transition temperature(Tg) of <b>the</b> <b>MENCs.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> Fe 3 O 4 -PGMA NPs could be evenly coated onto the functionalized ultra-high molecular weight poly(ethylene) (UHMWPE) textiles. The Fe 3 O 4 -gt-PGMA NPs were coated on the textile in order to prepare NP-coated textile-reinforced composite. Preliminary result of ET measurement showed that the Fe 3 O 4 -gt-PGMA NPs coated on the textiles could visualize the structure of the textile hidden inside and their relative depth. Accordingly, the incorporation of MNPs to polymers opens a new pathway of damage-free structural health monitoring of polymeric materials...|$|R

40|$|Two {{independent}} mutants of Escherichia coli K- 12, {{selected for}} {{their inability to}} grow anaerobically with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor, were shown to be deficient in menaquinone biosynthesis. In both cases, exogenously supplied 2 -succinylbenzoate promoted normal anaerobic growth on a lactate plus fumarate medium. Anaerobic growth of the mutants on glucose minimal medium was impaired but could be restored to normal by adding either uracil or 2 -succinylbenzoate. The addition of 2 -succinylbenzoate (but not uracil) permitted the synthesis of menaquinone and demethylmenaquinone by both mutants. The menaquinone content of the parental strain grown on lactate plus fumarate was three times greater than observed after growth on glucose. Transduction studies with phage P 1 showed that the two mutations are very closely linked and probably affect <b>the</b> same gene, <b>menC,</b> which is cotransducible with nalA (23 %), glpT (51 %), and purF (8 to 14 %). The gene order nalA-nrdA-glpTA-menC-purF was indicated. The results were consistent with 2 -succinylbenzoate being an intermediate in menaquinone biosynthesis and show that <b>the</b> gene designated <b>menC</b> (located at 48. 65 min of the E. coli chromosome) {{is involved in the}} conversion of chorismate to 2 -succinylbenzoate.

40|$|Background During {{a citywide}} {{epidemic}} of serogroup C meningococcal disease in Salvador in 2010, Brazil, {{the state government}} initiated mass vaccination targeting two age groups with high attack rates: individuals aged < 5 years and 10 – 24 years. More than 600, 000 doses of me-ningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines were administered. We performed a case-control study to evaluate vaccine uptake, document vaccine effectiveness and identify rea-sons for non-vaccination. Methods and Findings Population-based surveillance identified patients with laboratory-confirmed invasive meningo-coccal C (MenC) disease during 2010. Information onMenC vaccination was obtained from case patients and age-matched individuals from <b>the</b> same neighborhoods. <b>MenC</b> vaccine ef-fectiveness was estimated based on the exact odds ratios obtained by conditional logistic re-gression analysis. Of 51 laboratory-confirmed cases of serogroup Cmeningococcal disease among patients < 5 and 10 – 24 years of age 50 {{were included in the}} study and matched with 240 controls. Overall case-fatality was 25 %. MenC vaccine coverage among controls in-creased from 7. 1 % to 70. 2 % after initiation of the vaccination campaign. None of the 50 case patients but 70 (29. 2 %) of the 240 control individuals, including 59 (70. 2 %) of 84 matched with cases from <b>the</b> period after <b>MenC</b> vaccination, had received at least one MenC vaccine dose. Overall effectiveness of MenC was 98 %with a lower 95 % exact confidence limit of 89 %.
