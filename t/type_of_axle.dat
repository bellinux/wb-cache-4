5000|$|A {{dead axle}} (or hub and bearings) {{is much less}} common than the live axle setup used on most mini choppers. As opposed to a [...] "live" [...] axle, where the axle spins along with the wheel, this axle does not spin. The wheel or hub has {{built-in}} bearings {{to allow it to}} spin. Depending on the setup, all spinning components are attached to the hub or to the rim itself. The bearings and hub spin on the axle. This is the type of setup that is used on most motorcycles. Often, the axle is inserted into slotted dropouts and the chain is adjusted by moving the wheel forward or backward within the slots. This allows the engine to be mounted which makes the bike's drive train much more rigid and reliable. There are also other advantages to this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>axle,</b> including the possibility of a cleaner and more attractive rear axle area, but this setup is often more expensive than a live axle and custom parts are much more difficult to locate.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to predict}} the Dynamic Load Coefficient (DLC) of tyre forces from truck axles. Dynamic Load Coefficient is {{frequently}} used to characterise the dynamic loads generated by axles. It is a simple measurement of the dynamic variation magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> load, for a specific combination of road roughness and speed. Under normal operating conditions, the DLC's value is typically {{in the range of}} 0. 05 - 0. 3, and close to zero when the truck's wheels are moving over a perfectly smooth road. To achieve the objectives of this study, which is to determine the DLC's value for seven different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles,</b> a simple validated quarter-truck model was excited by a random road surface profile, in order to simulate a vehicle-road interaction. Points are equally spaced along the simulated road to generate dynamic loadings over a broad range of truck speeds. Multiple trucks gross-weight conditions were used to present realistic traffic behaviour. The results showed that irregular road profiles, exciting the vehicle as it travelled, caused continually changing tyre forces. Also, dynamic loading was seen to be fundamentally influenced by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> suspension (i. e., air and steel), loading condition, and vehicle speed. For example, the DLC value of the tyre forces of the quarter-truck fitted with a steel suspension was found to be more than twice that of the truck fitted with an air suspension. Tyre forces of the one-third laden truck were more aggressive than any other loading condition, due to the uncertain body-bounce generated by the truck, which was strongly dependent on surface irregularities. At low speed, the DLC was greatly decreased if the load was increased. Furthermore, DLC value was always lower for trucks with air suspension over steel suspension, for the same load and vehicle speed. However, air suspension efficiency was clearly better for higher axle loads...|$|R
