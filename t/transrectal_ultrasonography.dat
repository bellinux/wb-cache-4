This study determined the influence of melatonin treatment on follicular growth patterns and on in vitro oocyte developmental competence. In a first experiment, the effects of melatonin supplementation on follicular dynamics were evaluated using daily <b>transrectal</b> <b>ultrasonographies</b> for 21 days, in 7 multiparous Sarda goats receiving a subcutaneous implant of 18 mg of melatonin and in 5 control untreated does.

40|$|<b>Transrectal</b> {{real-time}} <b>ultrasonography</b> {{has proved}} to be a rapid and reliable technique for studying reproductive functions in cattle. Through ultrasonography it is now established that follicular growth occurs in wave-like patterns during each estrous cycle. It has been shown that follicular growth and regression continue during early pregnancy, as well as in the postpartum anestrous period. Ultrasound has also helped us to understand the influence of dominant follicles on medium and small follicles. Among the numerous demonstrated applications of ultrasonography, early pregnancy diagnosis, fetal sexing, and postpartum reproductive management appear to be promising areas for immediate application. The new information that has been generated through ultrasound has thrown light on hitherto poorly understood areas of ovarian follicular dynamics, corpus luteum function, pregnancy establishment, and embryonic development in cattle, thereby opening newer areas for research. Still there is great potential for the continued application of this technology to further our understanding of the reproductive processes and to maximize reproductive efficiency of the bovine species. The significant contributions of real-time ultrasonography to the study of bovine reproduction in general and its practical applications in particular are discussed in this paper.

Followup visits at 12, 26 and 52 weeks included International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume determination.

At baseline median patient age was 74 years and median prostate size was 67 ml. Median 133 kJ. were administered. Nine patients underwent re-treatment and 11 were lost to followup. The re-treatment rate after 1 year was 25 % (95 % confidence interval 11 to 40).

Animals- 10 intact male dogs that required euthanasia {{for reasons other than}} prostatic disease. Procedures- Prostatic length (L), width (W) and height (H) were measured in T A (L 1, W 1 and H 1) and TR (L 2 and H 2) ultrasonography. Prostatic volume was calculated using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid (VE 1 and VE 2) or for a box (VB 1 and VB 2) in TA and TR procedures, respectively. The dogs were euthanized, {{the prostate}} gland removed, and actual prostate dimensions and volume were measured. Linear regression was used to compare prostatic dimensions and volume measured by ultrasonography to actual ones. Results- In TR ultrasonography there was no damage to rectum, the time for evaluation {{of the prostate}} gland was faster and the resolution of prostatic images was better than other procedure. There was highly significant correlation between prostatic parameters and their actual dimension. VB 1, VE 1 and VB 2 were greater and VE 2 were lesser than actual prostatic volume.

40|$|Abstract Background In the ewe, ovarian antral follicles emerge or {{grow from}} {{a pool of}} 2 – 3 mm follicles in a wave like pattern, {{reaching}} {{greater than or equal to}} 5 mm in diameter before regression or ovulation. There are 3 or 4 such follicular waves during each estrous cycle. Each wave is preceded by a peak in serum FSH concentrations. The role of pulsatile LH in ovarian antral follicular emergence and growth is unclear; therefore, the purpose of the present study was to further define this role. Methods Ewes (n = 7) were given 200 ng of GnRH (IV) every hour for 96 h from Day 7 of the estrous cycle, to increase LH pulse frequency. Controls (n = 6) received saline. In a second study, ewes (n = 6) received subcutaneous progesterone-releasing implants for 10 days starting on Day 4 of the cycle, to decrease LH pulse frequency. Controls (n = 6) underwent sham surgery. Daily <b>transrectal</b> ovarian <b>ultrasonography</b> and blood sampling was performed on all ewes from the day of estrus to the day of ovulation at the end of the cycle of the study. At appropriate times, additional blood samples were taken every 12 minutes for 6 h and 36 min or 6 h in studies 1 and 2 respectively. Results The largest follicle of the follicular wave growing when GnRH treatment started, grew to a larger diameter than the equivalent wave in control ewes (P Conclusion We concluded that waves of ovarian follicular growth can occur at LH pulse frequencies lower than those seen in the luteal phase of the estrous cycle but frequencies seen in the follicular phase, when applied during the mid-luteal phase, in the presence of progesterone, do enhance follicular growth to resemble an ovulatory follicle, blocking the emergence of the next wave. </p...|$|R

We compared the clinical characteristics of adolescent CP/CPPS patients with those of young adults. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 20 adolescents with CP/CPPS aged < 20 years who visited our outpatient department from August 2005 to April 2012. The control group comprised 120 young adult CP/CPPS patients. A complete medical history, physical examination, {{the national institute of}} health-chronic prostatitis symptoms index (NIH-CPSI) questionnaire, urinalysis, expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or semen analysis, <b>transrectal</b> prostate <b>ultrasonography,</b> and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were performed.
