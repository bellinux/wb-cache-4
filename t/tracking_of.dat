40|$|Abstract. According to the {{principle}} producing the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter, to study the influence <b>of</b> the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter {{on the process of}} high speed ball-end milling, the single-factor models for evaluating the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter are established. Adopting four kinds of the typical cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter, the experiment of high speed ball-end milling is processed. The model of multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter is established, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter is accomplished by the application of fuzzy mathematics theory. Results show that the cutting contact curve of cutter affects directly the process of high speed ball-end milling, fuzzy and uncertain properties exist in the evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter. The optimum cutting track can be selected by multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter...|$|R

5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E

5|$|Descent: FreeSpace {{was well}} {{received}} as a single-player space simulation that integrated all the desired features of its genre, from competent AI wingmen, {{to the presence of}} large capital ships that not only dwarf the fighters piloted by the player, but also explode spectacularly when destroyed. However, the game's multiplayer mode was criticised, as it was plagued by lag and inaccurate <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> statistics. An expansion for the game, which was less well received, was also released in 1998 under the title of Silent Threat, and focuses on events after the main game's campaign with the player working for an intelligence branch of the Terrans' armed forces that later attempt to overthrow the Terran government. A sequel to Descent: FreeSpace entitled FreeSpace 2, was released in 1999 to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} surrounding the telescope's <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> space probes, this only {{took up a}} fraction of its observing time, with the remainder used for scientific observations. These include using radar to measure {{the distance to the}} Moon and to Venus; observations of astrophysical masers around star-forming regions and giant stars; observations of pulsars (including the discovery of millisecond pulsars and the first pulsar in a globular cluster); observations of quasars and gravitational lenses (including the detection of the first gravitational lens and the first Einstein ring). The telescope has also been used for SETI observations.|$|E
5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E

Moreover, the <b>track</b> <b>of</b> eye can be used also for detecting the indecision behind a final reply to a query. Therefore, taking decision making on WEB survey as an example, the decision making mechanism under the network environment was investigated by observing the <b>track</b> <b>of</b> eye. A correlation between a <b>track</b> <b>of</b> eye and the <b>track</b> <b>of</b> mouse was also estimated to investigate a relation between a <b>track</b> <b>of</b> mouse and a mentality on decision making. In experiments, a question was answered in a multiple answered query and by a slide bar. The eye and mouse track in the multiple-query can be used to evaluate the value of the bar as a confidence factor. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2010 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(環境学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 3492 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科人間環境学専...|$|R
5|$|On 3 June, Van der Sloot {{was arrested}} near Curacaví by the Investigations Police of Chile while {{traveling}} {{in a rented}} taxi on Highway 68 between the coastal city of Viña del Mar and the capital of Santiago. He was found with a laptop, foreign currency, a business card case, detailed charts of ocean currents around Lima, and bloody clothes. His phone's SIM card was missing, which made mobile phone <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> his location impossible. He told Chilean police that unidentified armed robbers hid {{in the hotel room}} and killed Flores when she disobeyed their order to be quiet. Van der Sloot's Dutch attorney claimed that his client {{was on his way to}} Santiago to turn himself in. He was subsequently expelled and transported by Chilean police in a Cessna 310 back to Arica to be handed over to Peruvian authorities at the Chacalluta border crossing on 4 June.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E

5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of the pack.|$|E
