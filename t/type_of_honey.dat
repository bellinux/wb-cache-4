Specific objectives relates to the determination of residues of streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin in 18 samples <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey,</b> such as: acacia honey, linden honey and polyfloral honey. Honey was purchased from Bacau County, in 2012, from the following localities: Moineşti, Onesti and Bacău. Antibiotic residues were determined with the RIA - Charm II test. The results revealed the existence of streptomycin residues in all samples <b>of</b> analyzed <b>honey,</b> above the permissible limits (40 ppb), except linden honey samples from Bacău. Tetracycline residues were found in all samples, the limits were exceeded only for acacia honey from Moineşti and linden honey from Oneşti. Erythromycin residues have not exceeded the limits admitted to any sample, but they showed great variability. In conclusion, at the county level, all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> often contain residues of antibiotics, although European rules on consumer safety forbid adding them for prevention. The danger of toxicity is evidenced by the existence <b>of</b> several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics in the same batch <b>of</b> <b>honey,</b> regardless <b>of</b> their concentration, due to their potential synergistic effect...|$|R
