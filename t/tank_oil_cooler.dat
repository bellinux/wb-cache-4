5000|$|On June 26, 41-2666 was {{assigned}} to the 8th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron, which provided reconnaissance for the Fifth Air Force. Due to their proximity to one another in Townsville, Australia, the squadron was frequently attached to the 435th. It was with the 435th that it flew its first mission on June 8, 1942, to Lae, a Japanese-held town on the coast of New Guinea. In July, '666 suffered an unusual accident in which a life raft somehow inflated while in flight, blew out a waist window and damaged the tail of the aircraft. The accident began the plane's reputation as a [...] "Hard Luck Hattie," [...] suffering frequent damage on its various missions. In December 1942, after being transferred to the 403rd Bomb Squadron of the 43rd Bomb Group, '666 was badly shot up after a mission to Rabaul, suffering hits to a gas <b>tank</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> with the left aileron and right elevator controls plus the main rib in the right wing shot out as well.|$|R
50|$|The Bristol Hercules 734 radial {{engines that}} powered the type, {{along with all}} of its major {{subsystems}} such as the cowling, <b>oil</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>cooler</b> and control cables, could also be easily detached for servicing; an entire engine replacement could be performed within 90 minutes. The fuel system is uncomplicated, being contained within a pair of 300-gallon fuel tanks positioned in the interspar bays of the wings; neither fuel tanks or hydraulic pipelines were present in the outer wings. The only elements that necessitated the use of the hydraulic systems were the clamshell doors and flaps. The electrically controlled carburation system had three different intakes, each suited to starting the engine under different conditions - these being hot, sub-zero, and temperate climates.|$|R
40|$|Two {{case studies}} {{completed}} {{under the direction}} of Jacobs Engineering are presented and discussed. In the first case study, the economics of the installation of an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> are examined. A vapor recovery unit (VRU) for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) facility in Grieve, WY, will be installed to capture the vapors from an <b>oil</b> <b>tank.</b> With the installation of the VRU, a question arose: would an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> proposed to be installed before the <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> be necessary? A simulation and economic analysis of the process suggests that <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> installation is still economically favorable. When the low pressure (LP) separator is operated at the typical temperature of 140 Â°F, nine additional barrels of oil per day (BOPD) are recovered through the use of an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> The net present worth (NPW) of <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> installation is calculated to be 248, 000. In the second case study, an overfill protection line was proposed to be installed for a gas flotation unit on an offshore oil rig. It was postulated {{that there might be a}} risk of hydrocarbon diffusion through the stagnant liquid in the line, presenting a hazard to equipment and personnel. Calculations were performed to approximate the rate of gas flux through the line. As the physical situation is difficult to model without precise information, alternative preventative methods are presented. ...|$|R

It introduces the operation of Bearing for lubricating oil film in monitoring method, common fault causes and treatment measures. Finally, the bearing cooling system structure is discussed, providing reference for practical engineering application. There are many reasons to cause the failure of the bearing lubrication such as bearing assembly defects, the error of size and cooling system problems. By detecting and contrast parameters, this study analyze the determine data and correct the fault.

5000|$|A minor {{problem was}} the oil hose from {{the lower part of}} the engine to the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This was too short since a running engine was moving {{separate}} from the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This hose was almost solid being under pressure and in time the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would crack.

30|$|As a {{consequence}} of this, and because Nfg and Np values are derived directly from the CVD data, any lack of compliance with stock <b>tank</b> <b>oil</b> material balance conservation is automatically (yet unintendedly) absorbed by Nfo. At high pressures, the differences in actual and calculated total stock <b>tank</b> <b>oil</b> are relatively small compared to Nfo; thus, the error is small and can be neglected. However, lower pressures exhibit greater differences in total stock <b>tank</b> <b>oil</b> and, therefore, the error can become significant. The imposition that total stock <b>tank</b> <b>oil</b> (NfgÂ +Â NfoÂ +Â Np) should remain the same during depletion (while actually decreasing with pressure depletion due to BO PVT shortcomings) invariably leads to a consistent overestimation of Nfo. This, in turn, leads to a consistent underestimation of Boâas per its definition shown in Fig.Â  1 and as illustrated in TableÂ  1.|$|R

Finally, by placing the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R

5000|$|... / - The {{sources of}} the main issues with the 6.0L were the {{in-block}} <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> and the EGR <b>cooler</b> materials. The <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> {{is located in the}} valley of the engine block, underneath the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> will develop small cracks in the aluminum tubes from the constant heating and cooling of the engine. This situation usually results in oil pushing it's way into the cooling system. The sludge created from the mixture of oil and coolant creates a high pressure environment in the EGR cooler (due to the viscosity change in the coolant), leading to cracking of the EGR cooler's coolant passages. Once the EGR cooler cracks, it begins to leak coolant into the intake system and is then routed into the engine's cylinders to be burnt. The burning of coolant in the cylinders then causes a steam buildup, thus increasing cylinder pressures and the stretching of the head bolts; which leads to head gasket failure. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to pre-mature failure without <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> issues, also resulting in head gasket failure.|$|R
