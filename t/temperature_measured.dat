25|$|Snow was {{observed}} {{to fall from}} cirrus clouds. The clouds formed at a level in the atmosphere that was around −65°C, so the clouds {{would have to be}} composed of water-ice, rather than carbon dioxide-ice (dry ice) because, at the low pressure of the Martian atmosphere, the temperature for forming carbon dioxide ice is much lower—less than −120°C. As a result of the mission, it is now believed that water ice (snow) would have accumulated later in the year at this location. This represents a milestone in understanding Martian weather. Wind speeds ranged from 11 to 58km per hour. The usual average speed was 36km per hour. These speeds seem high, but the atmosphere of Mars is very thin—less than 1% of the Earth's—and so did not exert much force on the spacecraft. The highest <b>temperature</b> <b>measured</b> during the mission was −19.6°C, while the coldest was −97.7°C.|$|E
25|$|On 19 January 2012 the {{interior}} of the primary containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with an industrial endoscope. This device, 8.5 millimeters in diameter, is equipped with a 360 degrees-view camera and a thermometer to measure the temperature at this spot and the cooling-water inside, in an attempt to calibrate the existing temperature-measurements that could have an error-margin of 20 degrees. The device was brought in by a hole at 2.5 meter above the floor where the vessel is located. The whole procedure lasted 70 minutes. The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the containment vessel. But they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside. According to TEPCO the photos showed no serious damage.

2500|$|Bailyn also {{distinguishes the}} two {{macroscopic}} approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic. The thermodynamic view {{was taken by}} the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century. It regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of <b>temperature,</b> <b>measured</b> primarily by calorimetry. A calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system, with its own temperature and internal energy; when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer, changes in it measure heat transfer. The mechanical view was pioneered by Helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century, largely through the influence of Max Born. It regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept, defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer, the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics, defined by macroscopic mechanics. According to Born, the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer of matter [...] "cannot be reduced to mechanics". It follows that there is no well-founded definition of quantities of energy transferred as heat or as work associated with transfer of matter.|$|E
2500|$|When {{considering}} lighting for an aquarium, {{there are}} generally two factors to consider: wattage and color temperature. Depending {{on the type}} of lighting (i.e. fluorescents, metal halide, etc.) the wattage of light emitted may vary considerably, from tens of watts to several hundred watts in a lighting system. Wattage, while not indicative of color, is equivalent to power and essentially determines how brightly the light will shine. Due to the scattering of light in water, the deeper one's tank is, the more powerful the lighting required. Color <b>temperature,</b> <b>measured</b> in kelvins (albeit slightly unrepresentively) refers to the color of light being emitted by the lamp and is based on the concept of blackbody radiation. [...] Light from the sun has a color temperature of approximately 5900 K and lighting systems with color temperatures >5000 K tend to be best for growing plants in both the marine and freshwater setting. 10,000 K light appears bluish-white and emphasizes coloration in fishes and corals. Higher up on the spectrum there are 14,000 K and 20,000 K bulbs that produce a deep blue tint which mimic the lighting conditions underseas, creating an optimal ambience for invertebrates and livestock present.|$|E

40|$|Various biometeorological indices and <b>temperature</b> <b>measures</b> {{have been}} used to assess heat-related health risks. Composite indices are {{expected}} to assess human comfort more accurately than do <b>temperature</b> <b>measures</b> alone. The performances of several common biometeorological indices and <b>temperature</b> <b>measures</b> in evaluating the heat-related mortality in Brisbane, Australia—a city with a subtropical climate—were compared. Daily counts of deaths from organic causes [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 9 th Revision, (ICD 9) codes 001 – 799 and ICD, 10 th Revision, (ICD 10) codes A 00 –R 99] during the period from 1 January 1996 to 30 November 2004 were used. Several composite biometeorological indices were considered, such as apparent temperature, relative strain index, Thom discomfort index, the humidex, and wet-bulb globe temperature. Hot days were defined as those days falling into the 95 th percentile of each thermal stress indicator. Case-crossover analysis was applied to estimate the relationship between exposure to heat and mortality. The performances of various biometeorological indices and <b>temperature</b> <b>measures</b> were compared using the jackknife resampling method. The results show that more deaths were likely to occur on hot days than on other (i. e., control) days regardless of the <b>temperature</b> <b>measure</b> or biometeorological index that is considered. The magnitude of the odds ratios varied with temperature indicators, between 1. 08 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 02 – 1. 14] and 1. 41 (95 % CI: 1. 22 – 1. 64) after adjusting for air pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm and ozone). Average temperature performed similarly to the composite indices, but minimum and maximum temperatures performed relatively poorer.
