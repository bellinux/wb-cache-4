40|$|The {{emphasis}} on schools providing reading materials {{for students at}} home is {{very much on the}} primary school years, when the skill of reading is being acquired. Little consideration has been given to the impact of curtailing school-mediated access <b>to</b> <b>books</b> beyond this point. Regular recreational reading offers a wide range of benefit, and is essential for supporting ongoing literacy development. Without easy access <b>to</b> <b>books,</b> it can be readily surmised that capacity for regular engagement in reading can be limited. This article adds to the body of research supporting the benefit of student access <b>to</b> <b>books</b> in the home, linking access <b>to</b> <b>books</b> in the home with improved attitudes toward, and frequency of engagement in recreational book reading, particularly in boys. It also provides analysis of data on students' access <b>to</b> <b>books</b> in the home, as well as discussing alternative avenues of access <b>to</b> <b>books,</b> such as the library and devices. The implications of the findings are explored, with educators ultimately urged to support increased access to self-selected home reading materials through the secondary school...|$|R

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution <b>to</b> <b>book</b> three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two.

5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid.

5|$|After a {{successful}} first contest, the second faced several location problems. The event originally {{should have been}} organised by British broadcaster ITV in Manchester.

It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount. The EBU approached Croatian broadcaster HRT, who had won the previous contest, to stage the event in Zagreb; though it later emerged that HRT had 'forgotten' <b>to</b> <b>book</b> the venue in which the contest would have taken place. It was at this point, with five months remaining until the event would be held, that Norwegian broadcaster NRK stepped in to host the contest in Lillehammer.|$|E

5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not <b>to</b> <b>book</b> busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{expected}} TV commercials during such TV hits as Friends and Law & Order, {{as well as}} one in {{the second}} quarter of Super Bowl XXXVII, there was also a tie-in with Kraft, an in-store promotion at Wal-Mart, a marketing campaign with Hamilton Watch Company, who designed the watch Matt wears in the film, and a weeklong Daredevil segment on Entertainment Tonight. As part of an online form of marketing, a viral e-mail drive was started, where participants would be entered in a contest where they could win prizes such as Daredevil T-shirts, Game Boy Advance games, and cufflinks. To enter the drawing, the user had <b>to</b> <b>book</b> tickets for the film online, then pass an e-mail on to someone else. The idea was to encourage online ticket booking, which at the time was seen as a growing trend. The Game Boy Advance Daredevil game was released on February 14, 2003, and was created by Encore, a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation. The soundtrack to the film, , was released in February 2003.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it <b>to</b> <b>book</b> trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction.

Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book, they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from {{the political and social}} issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang <b>to</b> <b>book</b> them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E
