5|$|Supporters of Newcastle United {{are drawn}} {{from all over the}} North East and beyond, with supporters' clubs in some {{countries}} across the world. The club's nickname is 'The Magpies', while the club's supporters are also known as the Geordies or the Toon Army. The name Toon originates from the Geordie pronunciation of town. In a 2004 survey by Co-operative Financial Services, it was found that Newcastle United topped the league table for the cost incurred and distance travelled by Newcastle-based fans wishing to travel to every Premier League away game. The <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> for a fan to attend every away game from Newcastle was found to be equivalent to a round-the-world trip. In the 2009–10 season, when the club were playing in English football's second tier, the Football League Championship, the average attendance at St James' Park was 43,388, the fourth-highest for an English club that season. At the end of the 2011–12 Premier league season, Newcastle United held the third-highest average attendance for the season, at 49,935. This figure was only surpassed by Arsenal and Manchester United, the only two clubs in the Premier League with larger stadiums.|$|E

2500|$|In cricket, the striker's end stumps and {{the bowling}} crease are [...] apart. The popping creases are [...] {{in front of}} the stumps and thus are [...] apart. The bowler's release point could be perhaps [...] beyond his popping crease (both {{positions}} change every over). The batsman tends to [...] "take guard" [...] or [...] "block" [...] on the popping crease, i.e. he stands [...] in front of his stumps. That nets to a typical distance of about [...] between delivery point and bat. In baseball, the pitcher's release point could be about [...] depending on his delivery style, but the batter also tends to stand back or [...] "deep" [...] in the batter's box, to maximise his time to [...] "look the ball over", up to [...] further from the pitching rubber than the point of home plate is. Thus the horizontal distance, from release of the ball by the pitcher/bowler to its arrival at the batter/batsman, is similar in both sports. However, the ball usually travels further in cricket as it normally bounces off the ground first, adding a significant vertical component to the <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> <b>travelled.</b>|$|E

In an attempt to increase crop performance on poor patches, spatially selective field operations may be performed by agricultural robotics to apply additional inputs with targeted requirements. This paper addresses the route planning problem for an agricultural robot that has to treat some poor-patches in a field with row crops, {{with respect to the}} minimization of the <b>total</b> non-working <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> during headland turnings and in-field <b>travel</b> <b>distance.</b> The traversal of patches in the field is expressed as the traversal of a mixed weighted graph, and then the problem of finding an optimal patch sequence is formulated as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem and solved by the partheno-genetic algorithm. The proposed method is applied on a cropping field located in Northwestern China. Research results show that by using optimum patch sequences, the <b>total</b> non-working <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> during headland turnings and in-field <b>travel</b> <b>distance</b> can be reduced. But the savings on the non-working distance inside the field interior depend on the size and location of patches in the field, and the introduction of agricultural robotics is beneficial to increase field efficiency...|$|R

50|$|The trace {{closest to}} the centrefield is the {{distance}} trace. The stylus moves {{up and down with}} distance travelled, producing a zig-zag pattern, often referred to as a 'V' trace.

40|$|The {{models and}} {{algorithms}} developed for transportation planning, vehicle routing, path finding and {{the software that}} utilize them are usually based on <b>distance</b> and constant <b>travel</b> times between the relevant locations and aim at minimizing <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> or <b>travel</b> time. However, constant travel time assumption is not realistic on road networks as the traffic conditions may vary from morning/evening rush hours to off-peak noon/night hours, from the weekends to business days, even from one season to another. Thus, distance/time based optimization does not exactly reflect the real fuel consumptions, hence the actual costs; neither can they be used to accurately account for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A distance/constant time based optimization model may even yield an infeasible solution when time-windows exist or the route length is time limited. In this study, we first analyze the peculiar characteristics of the Greenest Path Problem (GPP) where {{the objective is to}} find the least GHG generating path from an origin to a destination on the road network. We then propose a fast heuristic method for determining the greenest path, by incorporating fuel consumption and GHG emission objectives. Finally, we integrate the proposed algorithm into the Green Vehicle Routing Problem that minimizes the GHG emissions rather than the <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> or <b>travel</b> time. The developed heuristic is benchmarked against the existing algorithms by using synthetic traffic data on a real road network to illustrate potential savings and sustainability benefits...|$|R

The current aim is for Opportunity to reach Solander Point before winter reaches the Martian southern hemisphere as the area has ground tilted to the north allowing the rover to stay active during the winter months. In addition Solander Point has a large geological stack for Opportunity to explore.In April 2013, the rover passed through a three-week-long solar conjunction, when communication with Earth was blocked because of the Sun. The rover arm was positioned on a rock during that time so the APXS could collect data.|$|E
