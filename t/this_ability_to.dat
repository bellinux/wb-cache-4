5|$|Another type of play, called apad, is {{used for}} {{conveying}} linguistic messages from one player to another. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> mimic the intonations of the Maguindanao language on the three highest-tuned gongs has dubbed the gandingan as the talking gongs.|$|E
5|$|Part of White's appeal lies in <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> summon a powerful, {{particular}} {{vision of}} pre-industrial England. He offers his readers {{the key to}} a walled garden of mellow Queen Anne brick, lying beside Thomas Gray's country churchyard and an ancient water meadow.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> digest food {{outside the}} body, starfish can hunt prey {{much larger than}} their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5000|$|Thorndike {{identified}} {{the three main}} areas of intellectual development. The first being abstract intelligence. <b>This</b> is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> process and understand different concepts. The second is mechanical intelligence, which is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> handle physical objects. Lastly there is social intelligence. <b>This</b> is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> handle human interaction ...|$|R

5|$|Great mullein most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats has been linked to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Phil Senter {{published}} {{a study on}} dromaeosaurid toes and showed that their range of motion was compatible with the excavation of tough insect nests. Senter suggested that small dromaeosaurids such as Rahonavis and Buitreraptor were small enough to be partial insectivores, while larger genera such as Deinonychus and Neuquenraptor could have used <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> catch vertebrate prey residing in insect nests. However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E
5|$|Other moons in the Solar System {{are also}} tidally heated, and they too may {{generate}} additional heat through the friction of subsurface magma or water oceans. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> generate {{heat in a}} subsurface ocean increases the chance of life on bodies like Europa and Enceladus.|$|E

5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E
25|$|Readaptation: the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{change over}} time in {{response}} <b>to</b> the environment. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> is fundamental <b>to</b> {{the process of evolution}} and is determined by the organism's heredity, diet, and external factors.|$|R

2500|$|The Canadian {{courts have}} {{reserved}} {{the right to}} add and entrench principles and conventions into the Constitution unilaterally.

5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|Nao is {{a first-year}} student at Hoshinoumi Academy {{and is also}} its student council president. She is a hardworking, intelligent, and shrewd girl, but is also narcissistic, self-righteous, and short-tempered. She {{has the ability to}} make herself invisible, but this is limited to one person of her {{choosing}} at a time. She uses <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> her advantage to attack others she believes deserve to be kicked, but this causes her to be shunned and bullied by her peers. Although she initially shows no attraction towards Yuu, she eventually falls in love with him and stays by his side even after he loses all of his memories of her. She is a fan of Zhiend, influenced by her older brother , who once had the ability to control air movements and vibrations, which he used when playing the guitar.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are small- to {{medium-sized}} seabirds. The largest, {{the giant}} petrels with a wingspan of , {{are almost as}} large as albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan of , are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).|$|E
40|$|A new {{salmonella}} subgenus I serotype is described. Strein C. S. 1608 / 73, serotype 67 :R: 1, 2, {{was isolated}} from activated sewage sludge and was assigned the name S. crossness.

25|$|As family sizes decrease, the children's pester power, their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> force {{adults to}} do what the want, increases. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> enables them <b>to</b> have easier access to calorie-packed foods, such as candy and soda drinks.|$|R
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> provide {{real-time}} tissue {{loading data}} allows {{the computer to}} indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented flexibility of dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country uses {{a series}} of map screens to track the players' progress. Between each level, players control their {{character}} on the map screen, navigating {{to the next level}} they want to play. Each level on the map is marked with an icon: unfinished levels are marked by Kremlings (the game's main enemy), while friendly areas are marked by members of the Kong family. Every individual world map screen has one boss enemy {{at the end of the}} course, which must be defeated to travel back to the main map screen of the whole island. It is possible to access previous world maps without defeating the boss by finding Funky Kong and borrowing his barrel plane. Players use <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> select the world from the main screen, then the level within it. During play the game interface hides most game-related information, such as the number of bananas, letters, and animal tokens collected, as well as the number of lives remaining. When an item is collected, the relevant information briefly appears on the screen.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, {{the family}} moved to the village of Georgetown, Ohio, where five more {{siblings}} were born: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie, and Mary. At the age of five, young Grant began his formal education, starting at a subscription school and later was enrolled in two private schools. In the winter of 1836–1837, Grant was a student at Maysville Seminary, and in the autumn of 1838 he attended John Rankin's academy. In his youth, Grant developed an unusual ability to ride, work with, and control horses. Expressing a strong dislike for the tannery, Grant's father instead put <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use giving Ulysses work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people. Unlike his siblings, Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents. For the rest of his life, he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination. To others, including late in life, his own son, Grant appeared to be an agnostic. He inherited some of Hannah's Methodist piety and quiet nature while adopting his father's Whig political inclinations.|$|E
30|$|One skill {{considered}} {{necessary in}} this field is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> transform natural language statements to abstract conceptual structures that adhere to particular syntactic structures specified in a modeling language (Frederiks & van der Weide, 2006). One prerequisite for <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> is <b>to</b> {{be able to determine}} whether a given model is syntactically correct (Overhage, Birkmeier, & Schlauderer, 2012).|$|R
50|$|However, {{despite all}} <b>this,</b> the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make replayable {{recordings}} was extremely useful, {{and even with}} subsequent methods coming into use (direct-cut discs and Philips-Miller optical film) the Marconi-Stilles remained in use until the late 1940s.|$|R

5|$|On November 1, 2002 Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's Smallville: Dragon, {{about an}} ex-convict who assumes the abilities and {{appearance of a}} dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives {{him to try to}} kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special abilities. A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' Flight, about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is being abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother. Flight (like See No Evil) was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain that they could get the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped. Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, Hauntings follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house. Little, Brown Young Readers then published Animal Rage by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches). Heather uses <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> harm people who hurt animals until Clark discovers it and stops her. Aspect published Dean Wesley Smith's Whodunit, in which Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister while Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try rescuing Lionel himself.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
