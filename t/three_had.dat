During the campaign, 46 {{members of her}} crew had died; of these, only <b>three</b> <b>had</b> been killed in combat.|$|E
5|$|Three junior-age {{players were}} invited to {{training}} camp {{to take part in}} practices. All <b>three</b> <b>had</b> been drafted in the 1972 NHL Entry Draft and were clients of Alan Eagleson. The three stayed with the team during the Canadian stage of the series.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the <b>three</b> <b>had</b> reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
50|$|All <b>three</b> <b>have</b> {{had their}} numbers retired by the Islanders, and all <b>three</b> <b>have</b> been {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Bossy was inducted in 1991, Trottier in 1997, and Gillies in 2002.|$|R

5|$|Development of Wild Guns {{began when}} a small team of Natsume staff was asked to create a game quickly and cheaply while waiting for their next major assignment. The team {{consisted}} of three core members: Shunichi Taniguchi for game design and graphics, Toshiyasu Miyabe for programming, and Hiroyuki Iwatsuki for sound. Two other people helped as support staff. The team chose to develop for the Super NES because the <b>three</b> <b>had</b> worked together previously on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for that system. Development of Wild Guns lasted approximately five months and was led by Taniguchi.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the British {{government}} {{decided that the}} campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in Suakin. The New South Wales Contingent sailed for home on 17 May, arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885. Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while <b>three</b> <b>had</b> been wounded during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Last Exile {{was created}} by Gonzo in celebration of the company's 10th anniversary. It {{featured}} a production team led by director Koichi Chigira, character designer Range Murata, and production designer Mahiro Maeda.

5|$|The film starred Roekiah, Rd Djoemala, Kartolo, and Annie Landouw and {{featured}} Titing, Ismail, and Ramli. Roekiah had regularly been paired on-screen with Rd. Mochtar– {{despite being}} married to Kartolo– beginning with Terang Boelan. In 1938 the <b>three</b> <b>had</b> come to Tan's, where they acted together in three films beginning with Fatima. However, after a wage dispute following Siti Akbari (1940), Mochtar left the company. To replace him, Tan's hired the tailor Djoemala as Roekiah's romantic foil. Sorga Ka Toedjoe was their first film together.|$|E
5|$|When {{the ride}} opened in 2000, Cedar Point chose High End Systems, {{headquartered}} in Austin, Texas, {{to light the}} ride. Rob Decker, Cedar Point’s Corporate Director of Planning & Design, said that they thought {{they would have to}} mount multiple floodlights on the tower. However, they were able to install thirty EC-1 floodlights {{at the base of the}} lift hill structure which provided lighting throughout the ride's structure. Of the six main support towers, <b>three</b> <b>had</b> six EC-1s, and three towers had four EC-1s. The three tallest towers had another unit in the middle.|$|E
5|$|After 10 days of {{questioning}} Winter {{was taken to}} Rennes, where he was joined three days later by Captain Burton, Hollings, and Orr. These <b>three</b> <b>had</b> managed to stay together when the boat was sunk, and were captured by a German parachute unit carrying out manoeuvres. Burton {{was sent to a}} prisoner of war camp in Germany, Winter, Hollings and Orr were taken to Frankfurt and handed over to the Gestapo for further questioning, after which Winter was sent to a prisoner of war camp at Memmingen. The fate of Hollings and Orr has never been established. Winter and a Special Air Service officer escaped from the camp in April 1945, disguised as French soldiers. Desgranges was also able to escape from captivity, travelling via Spain to Britain, where he joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE).|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command. All but two or <b>three</b> <b>had</b> served in colonial or state government during their careers. The vast majority (about 75%) of the delegates were or had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during the Revolution. Several had been state governors. Just two delegates, Roger Sherman and Robert Morris, would be signatories {{to all three of}} the nation's founding documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of which <b>three</b> <b>had</b> fallen and twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, the libraries, combined, {{employed}} about 120 people (FTE), {{of which}} 23 were librarians. The <b>three</b> <b>had</b> {{a total of}} almost 1.6 million volumes in the collections, 16,992 serials, 2.1 million microform documents, and 3,849 e-books. The Valley Library alone contained 1.4 million volumes and 14,000 serials out of those totals. Valley also has over 500,000 government documents and maps, as it {{has served as a}} Federal Depository Library since 1907 and is a deposit library for the state government as well. The three libraries combined had a budget of $10.8 million and a circulation of 347,000 while servicing 24,000 inter-library loans and averaging about 34,000 people per week at the libraries.|$|E

5|$|Hardy next {{competed in}} the SmackDown! King of the Ring tournament, losing to {{eventual}} winner Booker T in the opening round thanks to a low blow and distraction from Sharmell. Hardy also became {{the first man to}} defeat Mr. Kennedy in singles' competition. On July 25, after the SmackDown! taping, Hardy was taken out of action after doctors found the remnants of the staph infection that had plagued him the previous year. He was sidelined until August 25 while he healed. Hardy made a surprise appearance backstage at Unforgiven after Jeff's match against Johnny Nitro. Lita joined the two in the segment, making this the first time the <b>three</b> <b>had</b> been seen together on WWE television since February 2003.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{issued an}} {{executive}} order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. Sherman agreed with Hayes that the <b>three</b> <b>had</b> to resign, but he made clear {{in a letter to}} Arthur that he had no personal grudge against the Collector. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements but the Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees.|$|E
5|$|Ignoring the batteries, Stopford {{ordered his}} {{squadron}} to attack at 09:00 on 24 February, HMS Defiance leading the line. Shortly after the main batteries of Stopford's ships {{of the line}} came into the battle, the French ships were overwhelmed {{one by one and}} shortly after noon all <b>three</b> <b>had</b> been driven ashore with heavy casualties. British histories recount that all three were destroyed, although French histories report that they were salvaged but found to be damaged beyond repair. The fleet under Willaumez was trapped in the anchorage at Basque Roads on 26 February and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in April with heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|Kunivas' {{condition}} worsens, and Korris, Konmel, and Worf {{are present}} when he dies, {{and the three}} let out a fierce roar as per Klingon custom. As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question {{the nature of the}} attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the <b>three</b> <b>had</b> commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small raiding party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on the Plum River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, <b>three</b> <b>had</b> left when the raiding party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton was hunting nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside and looked up to see a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two ships}} {{of the ten}} were completed: Cöln and Dresden. Five other ships were launched, but not completed—these ships {{received}} names—and the remaining <b>three</b> <b>had</b> only had some work done to their keels before work ceased. These latter three ships were known only by their contract names. Cöln and Dresden had very limited careers, since they were completed so late in the war. They both participated in a fleet sortie into the northern North Sea that attempted to intercept a heavily-escorted convoy from Britain to Norway. And they {{were assigned to the}} abortive final sortie in October 1918. Both cruisers were interned in Scapa Flow and scuttled there in June 1921, and both remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
