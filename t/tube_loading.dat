50|$|Geometric unsharpness {{is caused}} by aspects of the {{geometry}} of the X-ray beam. Two principal factors play simultaneously: the apparent focal spot size and the ratio between object-film distance (OFD) and focus-film distance (FFD). Fine focal spot sizes will minimise geometric unsharpness, and therefore give more detailed images, but it is often impossible to employ them due to the <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> necessary in the exposure. Keeping the ratio FFD:OFD high will minimise geometric unsharpness. This is most easily done by keeping the OFD to a minimum, i.e., keeping {{the part of the}} body being X-rayed as close to the detector as possible. If this is not possible however, then increasing FFD beyond the normal 100-110 cm will be necessary to keep the unsharpness level acceptable.|$|E

30|$|The {{choice of}} imaging {{parameters}} determines the image {{quality and the}} radiation dose. Generally, examinations with high kV and mAs settings, thin collimation and low pitch result in the best image quality. The downside is a relatively high radiation exposure of the patient and increased examination time and <b>tube</b> <b>loading.</b> <b>Tube</b> <b>loading</b> is no longer relevant for the newer multidetector-row CTs (MD-CT). For older generation scanners, the technical ability of the scanner will determine the practically achievable collimation, pitch and exposure factors. The examination time can be a relevant factor for image quality. Breathing and especially movement artefact can significantly affect image quality. In particular, movement artefact can render examinations non-diagnostic. In confused or otherwise uncooperative patients, exam speed rather than top resolution might be the main priority.|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, the {{variability}} {{of the percentage of}} correct answers was high for iDose in the range of 220 – 160 mAs, whereas it was much lower with IMR, even at reduced <b>tube</b> <b>loading.</b> This was due to possible reconstruction limitations of iDOSE, which might stress the perception variability among observers. As previously described, psychological factors could, in fact, affect the test results [10]. As observers have performed the test in different moments of the day, diagnostic accuracy, visual accommodation, reading time, subjective ratings of fatigue and visual strain, before and after a day of clinical reading, may all have contributed as confounding factors in terms of image quality evaluations. Image texture, artefacts and over-smoothing of images with higher strengths of IR may have affected diagnostic results [24].|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{uniformity}} in radiological imaging, {{it is recommended that}} the concept of equivalence in shape (quality) and size (quantity) of clinical Xray beams should be used for carrying out the comparative evaluation of image and patient dose. When used under the same irradiation geometry, X-ray beams that are strictly or relatively equivalent in terms of shape and size will produce identical or relatively identical image quality and patient dose. Simple mathematical models and software program EQSPECT. FOR were developed for the comparative evaluation of the performance characteristics in terms of contrast (C), contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and figure-of-merit (FOM = CNR 2 /DOSE) for spectrally equivalent beams transmitted through filter materials referred to as conventional and k-edged. At the same value of operating potential (kVp), results show that spectrally equivalent beam transmitted through conventional filter with higher atomic number (Z-value) in comparison with that transmitted through conventional filter with lower Z-value resulted in the same value of C and FOM. However, in comparison with the spectrally equivalent beam transmitted through filter of lower Z-value, the beam through filter of higher Z-value produced higher value of CNR and DOSE at equal <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> (mAs) and kVp. Under the condition of equivalence of spectrum, at scaled (or reduced) <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> and same kVp, filter materials of higher Z-value can produce the same values of C, CNR, DOSE and FOM as filter materials of lower Z-value.

30|$|Referring to Fig.  5, on the {{one hand}} the {{percentage}} of correct answers is a proper quantification of the efficiency of the application of the various reconstruction algorithms for low-contrast details identification, on the other hand the standard deviation is a good descriptor of inter-observer’s variability of image quality evaluation. The comparison between the different acquisition and image reconstruction modalities confirmed the highest efficiency for IMR, level 3 [22]. In fact, in all tested conditions low-contrast detection rates were greater for IMR than for FBP or iDOSE; low-contrast detectability was preserved with IMR up to a <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> reduction to 40 mAs.

30|$|Image quality {{analysis}} anyway confirmed data already reported in literature, supporting {{the efficiency of}} the novel IR methods if compared to standard reconstruction algorithms such as FBP [17, 18]. Regarding noise, it initially increased while mAs values were lowered using FBP reconstruction. The application of iDose constantly reduced it, even at decreasing mAs, and IMR kept it low while <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> reduced to 50 mAs. Below this value, noise increased with a consequent degradation of the image quality due to IR limits at very low mAs values [19]. It was observed that the uniformity values were within the advised limit (ΔHU[*]≤[*] 4) [20]. iDOSE provided, therefore, a similar image resolution to that obtained with FBP at significantly higher mAs values. Our results represent, therefore, a valuable confirmation that the use of IR algorithms preserves the spatial resolution while reducing mAs [21], except at very low tube load (i.e. <[*] 50 mAs) where a very small decrease in spatial resolution was found [19].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{quality of}} a {{radiography}} system is affected by several factors, a major one being the focal spot size of the x-ray tube. In fact, the measurement of such size is recognized to be of primary importance during acceptance tests and image quality evaluations of clinical radiography systems. The most common device providing {{an image of the}} focal spot emission distribution is a pin-hole camera, which requires a high <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> in order to produce a measurable signal. This work introduces an alternative technique to obtain an image of the focal spot, through the processing of a single radiograph of a simple test object, acquired with a suitable magnification. Methods: The radiograph of a magnified sharp edge is a well-established method to evaluate the extension of the focal spot profile along the direction perpendicular to the edge. From a single radiograph of a circular x-ray absorber, it is possible to extract simultaneously the radial profiles of several sharp edges with different orientations. The authors propose a technique that allows to obtain an image of the focal spot through the processing of these radial profiles by means of a pseudo-CT reconstruction technique. In order to validate this technique, the reconstruction has been applied to the simulated radiographs of an ideal disk-shaped absorber, generated by various simulated focal spot distributions. Furthermore, the method has been applied to the focal spot of a commercially available mammography unit. Results: In the case of simulated radiographs, the results of the reconstructions have been compared to the original distributions, showing an excellent agreement for what regards both the overall distribution and the full width at half maximum measurements. In the case of the experimental test, the method allowed to obtain images of the focal spot that have been compared with the results obtained through standard techniques, namely, pin-hole camera and slit camera. Conclusions: The method was proven to be effective for simulated images and the results of the experimental test suggest that it could be considered as an alternative technique for focal spot distribution evaluation. The method offers the possibility to measure the actual focal spot size and emission distribution at the same exposure conditions as clinical routine, avoiding high <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> {{as in the case of}} the pin-hole imaging technique...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to discuss {{strategies}} to minimize contrast medium (CM) doses in patients at risk of CM-induced nephropathy (CIN) after computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and percutaneous catheter angiography (PCA) and vascular interventions (PVI).

In high CIN-risk patients (e. g., eGFR < 45 ml/min or multiple risk factors), it is recommended to keep the g-I/eGFR ratio < 0. 5. In azotemic patients, 80 kVp CTA may be accomplished with 100 - 150 mg I/kg while x-ray <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> must be increased to maintain the contrast-to-noise ratio at an acceptable level. Peripheral PCA/PVI based on digital subtraction technique may be performed with 75 - 150 mg I/ml, or even lower if the equipment permits manual setting of the x-ray tube potential. Coronary arteriography/interventions may be achieved with 140 - 150 mg I/ml, i. e., less than half the routinely used concentrations (similar to 320 - 370 mg I/ml), especially in thinner patients with increased iodine attenuation due to automatic down regulation of the x-ray tube potential.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 There {{has been}} a large {{increase}} in the number of three-phase diagnostic x-ray systems installed in hospital special-procedure rooms during the last decade. The reason for this is the capability of three-phase systems of making possible the very short exposure times and increased <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> required for some of the recently developed radiological procedures. Analysis of the voltage waveforms indicates that x-ray beams produced by three-phase systems have a higher effective energy and a higher exposure rate than those produced by single-phase equipment operated at the same kilovoltage and tube current. This study compares dose distributions for single- and three-phase x-ray systems operated under conditions similar to those used in medical radiography. Depth-dose data were taken using thermoluminescent dosimeters in a tissue equivalent (Mix D) phantom at 40, 60, 80, 100, 125, and 150 kVp. Measurements were made at 1 cm intervals from the incident phantom surface to a depth of 13 cm, and at 2 cm intervals from 13 to 25 cm. The source to phantom surface distance was 30 inches. Curves of equivalent kilovoltage, which would provide approximately the same radiographic results, were derived for single- and three-phase systems. The data were normalized for equal exposures for various phantom thicknesses related to the energy used, and dose differentials were determined for both equal and equivalent kilovoltages...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} a new method based on a coded aperture mask combined with a digital x-ray imaging detector for measurements of the focal spot sizes of diagnostic x-ray tubes. Common techniques for focal spot size measurements employ a pinhole camera, a slit camera, or a star resolution pattern. The coded aperture mask is a radiation collimator consisting of a large number of apertures disposed on a predetermined grid in an array, through which the radiation source is imaged onto a digital x-ray detector. The method of the coded mask camera allows one to obtain a one-shot accurate and direct measurement of the two dimensions of the focal spot (like that for a pinhole camera) but at a low <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> (like that for a slit camera). A large number of small apertures in the coded mask operate as a ???multipinhole??? with greater efficiency than a single pinhole, but keeping the resolution of a single pinhole. Methods: X-ray images result from the multiplexed output on the detector image plane of such a multiple aperture array, and the image of the source is digitally reconstructed with a deconvolution algorithm. Images of the focal spot of a laboratory x-ray tube (W anode: 35 ??? 80 kVp; focal spot size of 0. 04 mm) were acquired at different geometrical magnifications with two different types of digital detector (a photon counting hybrid silicon pixel detector with 0. 055 mm pitch and a flat panel CMOS digital detector with 0. 05 mm pitch) using a high resolution coded mask (type no-two-holes-touching modified uniformly redundant array) with 480 0. 07 mm apertures, designed for imaging at energies below 35 keV. Measurements with a slit camera were performed for comparison. A test with a pinhole camera and with the coded mask on a computed radiography mammography unit with 0. 3 mm focal spot was also carried out. Results: The full width at half maximum focal spot sizes were obtained from the line profiles of the decoded images, showing a focal spot of 0. 120 ???mm× 0. 105 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 6. 1, with a detector entrance exposure as low as 1. 82 mR (0. 125 mA???s tube load). The slit camera indicated a focal spot of 0. 112 ???mm× 0. 104 ???mm at 35 kVp and M = 3. 15, with an exposure at the detector of 72 mR. Focal spot measurements with the coded mask could be performed up to 80 kVp. Tolerance to angular misalignment with the reference beam up to 7 ° in in-plane rotations and 1 ° deg in out-of-plane rotations was observed. The axial distance of the focal spot from the coded mask could also be determined. It is possible to determine the beam intensity via measurement of the intensity of the decoded image of the focal spot and via a calibration procedure. Conclusions: Coded aperture masks coupled to a digital area detector produce precise determinations of the focal spot of an x-ray tube with reduced <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> and measurement time, coupled to a large tolerance in the alignment of the mask...|$|E
40|$|X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is an {{essential}} imaging technique for different diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. However, ionizing radiation from CT scanners represents the largest source of medical exposure for the population of industrialized countries. In order to reduce CT dose during patient examination, iterative reconstruction algorithms {{have been developed to}} help existing dose reduction methods. In this paper, we studied the image quality performance of a 64 -slice CT scanner (Optima CT 660, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) that implements both the conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) and the Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (ASIR, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) algorithm. In order to compare the performance of these two reconstruction technologies, CT images of the Catphan® 504 phantom were reconstructed using both conventional FBP and ASIR with different percentages of reconstruction from 20 % to 100 %. Noise level, noise power spectrum (NPS), contrast-to -noise ratio (CNR) and modulation transfer function (MTF) were estimated for different values of the main radiation exposure parameters (i. e. mAs, kVp, pitch and slice thickness) and contrast objects. We found that, as compared to conventional FBP, noise/CNR decreases/increases non-linearly up to 50 %/ 100 % when increasing the ASIR blending level of reconstruction. Furthermore, ASIR modifies the NPS curve shape (i. e. the noise texture). The MTF for ASIR-reconstructed images depended on both <b>tube</b> <b>load</b> and contrast level, whereas MTF of FBP-reconstructed images did not.

Purpose The aim {{of this research was}} to determine optimal X-ray beam energy for cardiac image acquisition in a system-independent manner, for a range of paediatric and adult patient sizes. Methods Patients and iodine based contrast medium were simulated using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and tin respectively. X-ray tube voltage (kVp) and Cu X-ray beam filtration were independently varied and images were captured on a flat panel detector based cardiac X-ray imaging system. Tin detail contrast was calculated and flat field image noise was measured to determine the contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Entrance surface and effective dose measurements were obtained to calculate CNR 2 / dose, which determined dose efficiency. Results Lower kVp was favoured, more so for thinner PMMA; as Cu increased, lower kVp was favoured. For the smallest phantom (8. 5 cm), CNR 2 / dose was highest at 50 kVp with 0. 4 mm Cu considering both dose measurements. For the largest phantom (30 cm), using 80 kVp with 0. 25 mm Cu and 85 kVp with no filtration provided the highest CNR 2 / dose for entrance surface and effective dose respectively.

This study examined independently the effects of peak x-ray tube voltage (kVp), copper (Cu), and gadolinium (Gd) x-ray beam filtration on the image quality to radiation dose balance for adult patient sizes. Methods: Image sequences of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantoms representing two adult patient sizes were captured using a modern flat panel detector based x-ray imaging system. Tin and copper test details were used to simulate iodine-based contrast medium and stents∕guide wires respectively, which are used in clinical procedures. Noise measurement for a flat field image and test detail contrast were used to calculate the contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Entrance surface dose (ESD) and effective dose measurements were obtained to calculate the figure of merit (FOM), CNR(2) ∕dose. This FOM determined the dose efficiency of x-ray spectra investigated. Images were captured with 0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 4, and 0. 9 mm Cu filtration and with a range of gadolinium oxysulphide (Gd 2 O 2 S) filtration. Results: Optimum x-ray spectra were the same for the tin and copper test details. Lower peak tube voltages were generally favored. For the 20 cm phantom, using 2 Lanex Fast Back Gd 2 O 2 S screens as x-ray filtration at 65 kVp provided the highest FOM considering ESD and effective dose. Considering ESD, this FOM was only marginally larger than that from using 0. 4 mm Cu at 65 kVp. For the 30 cm phantom, using 0. 25 mm copper filtration at 80 kVp was most optimal; considering effective dose the FOM was highest with no filtration at 65 kVp. Conclusions: These settings, adjusted for x-ray <b>tube</b> <b>loading</b> limits and clinically acceptable image quality, should provide a useful option for optimizing patient dose to image quality in cardiac x-ray imaging. The same optimal x-ray beam spectra were found for both the tin and copper details, suggesting that iodine contrast based imaging and visualization of interventional devices could potentially be optimized for dose using similar x-ray beam spectra...|$|E
