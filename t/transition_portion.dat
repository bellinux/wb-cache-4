It summarizes a previous method {{to develop a}} first order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the landing surface shape, based on kinematics and dynamics, which limits the equivalent fall height (EFH) on landing. These are compared with theoretical expressions for EFH in tabletop jumps, which are shown to have linearly increasing and possibly large EFH values near {{the ends of the}} tabletop and linear landing surface portions. Finding solutions to the ODE is explored, with a large emphasis on determining the singular point where the ODE numerical integration can begin. Analysis is conducted to determine a good way to design a curved in-run <b>transition</b> <b>portion</b> of the jump that limits the additional centripetal acceleration on a particle undergoing the required velocity change of direction of a given amount. This turn can be accomplished using a unique curve known as a clothoid, which minimizes jerk along the path.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the sufficient perceptual cues used in the recognition of four voiceless fricative consonants [s, f,, f] followed by the same vowel [i:] in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adult listeners. Subjects identified the four CV speech tokens in a closed-set response task across a range of presentation levels. Fricative syllables were either produced by a human speaker in the natural stimulus set, or generated by a computer program in the synthetic stimulus set. By comparing conditions in which the subjects were presented with equivalent degrees of audibility for individual fricatives, it was possible to isolate the factor of lack of audibility from that of loss of suprathreshold discriminability. Results indicate that (a) the frication burst portion may serve as a sufficient cue for correct recognition of voiceless fricatives by normal-hearing subjects, whereas the more intense CV <b>transition</b> <b>portion,</b> though it may not be necessary, can also assist these subjects to distinguish place information, particularly at low presentation levels; (b) hearing-impaired subjects achieved close-to-normal recognition performance when given equivalent degrees of audibility of the frication cue, but they obtained poorer-than-normal performance if only given equivalent degrees of audibility of the transition cue; (c) the difficulty that hearing-impaired subjects have in perceiving fricatives under normal circumstances may be due to two factors: the lack of audibility of the frication cue and the loss of discriminability of the transition cue.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 A {{modeling}} {{study is}} undertaken {{to better understand}} the physics of katabatic flows. This study is divided into three topics; a comparison between a large eddy simulation (LES) and a mesoscale model of katabatic flows, a sensitivity study of katabatic flows to various physical parameters, and an investigation into the effect of subgrid scale terrain features on katabatic flow models. In the first topic, a comparison between LES, and a mesoscale model, ARPS, of katabatic flows is made to better quantify the accuracy of subgrid parametenzation in ARPS. It is shown that, although the modeled flows agree on a number of parameters, the LES model produces a lower and faster jet than that of ARPS, and also cools more near the surface. The momentum budgets of the two models agree well with each other. The ARPS model has a higher amount of TKE than the LES model, due to an overproduction by shear in the ARPS subgrid parameterizations. The second portion of this thesis represents a sensitivity study of katabatic flows to various physical parameters. The depth and strength of katabatic flows are shown to vary with surface heat fluxes, slope angle, and ambient stratification. Katabatic flows are shown to grow in depth and magnitude as slope angle increases, due to an increase in entrainment of overlying ambient air. The ratio of advection to mixing is shown to collapse to a near universal value regardless of surface heat fluxes. With increasing ambient stratification, entrainment in katabatic flows becomes small and the momentum equation is reduced to a two-way balance between buoyancy and drag. In this case, the heat flux of entrained air into the katabatic flow approaches that of the surface cooling, and the flow ceases to grow in the down-slope direction. Finally, predictions for bulk velocity and buoyancy strength scales are developed as a function of slope angle and surface heat fluxes. The last portion of this study focuses on the effect of subgrid scale terrain features on katabatic flows. It is shown that in areas of inadequate terrain resolution, the effect of the terrain smoothing routine in ARPS is to increase the slope height in areas of concave mountains. The concept of energy conversion in katabatic flows is introduced, and it is shown that the effect of raising terrain is to assign parcels more buoyant potential energy than they would otherwise have, and thus over-predict the magnitude of katabatic flows. Finally, an investigation into the effect of changing upper slope angle on katabatic flows over combined slopes is made. It is concluded that a combined slope cannot be predicted using a linear combination of simple slopes, since the <b>transition</b> <b>portion</b> of the slope results in a turbulent hydraulic jump with enhanced mixing. The magnitude of mixing in the turbulent hydraulic jump in combined slopes is shown to depend on the difference between upper and lower slope angle...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a transient pressure analysis method for analyzing the rate decline of a constant pressure well producing in an infinite double-porosity reservoir, without wellbore skin. This analysis method {{may be used}} to interpret well test rate data, and to compute the rate behavior of an infinitely acting reservoir that is being produced at constant pressure. The development of the pseudo steady state log-log type curve Is presented along with a hypothetical example of its use. This type curve allows the estimation of the two controlling parameters in double-porosity systems: {lambda} and {omega}. The first parameter, {lambda}, describes the interporosity flow, and the second parameter, {omega} describes the relative fracture storativity. This paper considers the estimation of these two parameters. The estimations of permeabilities and storativities have been described in the past, hence, are not considered. In a double-porosity system, with pseudo steady state interporosity flow, the initial infinite acting rate decline, representing only the fracture system, is followed by a constant rate flow period. The length of this constant rate flow period is controlled by the parameter {omega}. The beginning of this period is controlled by the interporosity flow parameter, {lambda}. Following this constant rate period, the rate resumes an infinite homogeneous decline, representing the total system, fractures and matrix. The parameters {lambda} and {omega} may be estimated from a log-log match of rate data to the type curve. A comparison between rate responses of two transient flowing matrices and the pseudo steady state matrix Is presented. Transient interporosity flow allows the matrix to increase the well flowrate in the early and <b>transition</b> <b>portions</b> of the flow. The final decline, representing the total system, is identical to the decline with a pseudo steady state matrix...|$|R

Method: College students (N = 388) at a midsized northeastern public university were assessed during the summer before matriculation and during the spring semesters of their freshman and sophomore years. A recently developed mixed model for analyzing longitudinal response patterns with predominating zeros was employed to examine categorical <b>transitions</b> (binary <b>portion)</b> and growth (intensity portion). Results: As expected, there were strong effects of time reflected in both the binary and intensity portions of the models across the three outcomes (weekly alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and alcohol-related problems). Parental permissiveness of drinking and student intention to affiliate with fraternity/sorority organizations predicted the transition to use and consequence status for all three outcomes and for increases in alcohol use and consequences. Peer disapproval of drinking strongly predicted all alcohol use and consequence outcomes. Parental disapproval of heavy drinking, parental monitoring, and male gender were variably influential across the outcomes at low to moderate levels. Conclusions: Our findings indicate the importance of the parental context (e. g., parental permissiveness of drinking) as well as peer influences (e. g., intended fraternity/sorority involvement) in drinking behavior among college students. These findings underscore the need to examine both onset and growth of drinking outcomes. Intervention and prevention implications are explored...|$|R

Unlike sorption, helium desorption off the powder sample was bimodal, while desorption off the lumps, after the third sorption–desorption cycle, was not (Romanov and Soong 2009).

To test the functional significance of alternative hinge regions, we constructed transgenic fly lines in which fast muscle isovariant hinge A was switched for slow muscle hinge B in the MHC isoforms of indirect flight and jump muscles. Substitution of the slow muscle hinge B impaired flight ability, increased sarcomere lengths by approximately 13 % and resulted in minor disruption to indirect flight muscle sarcomeric structure compared with a transgenic control. With age, residual flight ability decreased rapidly and myofibrils developed peripheral defects. Computational analysis indicates that hinge B has a greater coiled-coil propensity and thus reduced flexibility compared to hinge A. Intriguingly, the MHC rod with hinge B was approximately 5 nm longer than myosin with hinge A, consistent with the more rigid coiled-coil conformation predicted for hinge B. Our study demonstrates that hinge B cannot functionally substitute for hinge A in fast muscle types, likely as a result of differences in the molecular structure of the rod, subtle changes in myofibril structure and decreased ability to maintain sarcomere structure in indirect flight muscle myofibrils. Thus, alternative hinges are important in dictating the distinct functional properties of myosin isoforms and the muscles in which they are expressed...|$|R

The behaviour of each species will be evaluated by the total time spent in each portion of the cage (upper, middle, lower), number of hops and <b>transition</b> between the <b>portions,</b> number of interactions with the novel object, and the time elapsed when the researcher opens the cage to when the bird successfully flees. A common garden experiment suggests that selection can act on neophobia amongst hoarding birds that inhabit harsh vs. mild environments. Building on this, non-hoarding great tits are predicted to exhibit more neophilic tendencies than coal tits, who can use their food caches to buffer environmental fluctuations in food abundance. Neophilic tendencies in hoarding vs. non-hoarding tit specie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a quasispecies model where cells can adopt a two-cell survival strategy. Within this strategy, pairs of cells join together, {{at which point}} one of the cells sacrifices its own replicative ability {{for the sake of}} the other cell. We develop a simplified model for the evolutionary dynamics of this process, allowing us to solve for the steady-state using standard approaches from quasispecies theory. We find that our model exhibits two distinct regimes of behavior: At low concentrations of limiting resource, the two-cell strategy outcompetes the single-cell survival strategy, while at high concentrations of limiting resource, the single-cell survival strategy dominates. Associated with the two solution regimes of our model is a localization to delocalization <b>transition</b> over the <b>portion</b> of the genome coding for the multicell strategy, analogous to the error catastrophe in standard quasispecies models. The existence of such a transition indicates that multicellularity can emerge because natural selection does not act on specific cells, but rather on replicative strategies. Within this framework, individual cells become the means by which replicative strategies are propagated. Such a framework is therefore consistent with the concept that natural selection does not act on individuals, but rather on populations.

40|$|Nitrate is an {{essential}} nutrient for plants, and crops depend on its availability for growth and development, but its presence in agricultural soils is far from stable. In order to overcome nitrate fluctuations in soil, plants have developed adaptive mechanisms allowing them to grow despite changes in external nitrate availability. Nitrate can act as both nutrient and signal, regulating global gene expression in plants, and the root tip has been proposed as the sensory organ. A set of genome-wide studies has demonstrated several nitrate-regulated genes in the roots of many plants, although only {{a few studies have}} been carried out on distinct root zones. To unravel new details of the transcriptomic and proteomic responses to nitrate availability in a major food crop, a double untargeted approach was conducted on a <b>transition</b> zone-enriched root <b>portion</b> of maize seedlings subjected to differing nitrate supplies. The results highlighted a complex transcriptomic and proteomic reprogramming that occurs in response to nitrate, emphasizing the role of this root zone in sensing and transducing nitrate signal. Our findings indicated a relationship of nitrate with biosynthesis and signalling of several phytohormones, such as auxin, strigolactones, and brassinosteroids. Moreover, the already hypothesized involvement of nitric oxide in the early response to nitrate was confirmed with the use of nitric oxide inhibitors. Our results also suggested that cytoskeleton activation and cell wall modification occurred in response to nitrate provision in the transition zone...|$|R
40|$|Starburst dendrimers (SBDs) of {{different}} generations (size) {{and level of}} protonations of their surface amino groups and solutions of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles were analyzed, both separately and in mixtures of the two components, by negative-staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and, mainly, by computer-aided continuous wave (CW) - and pulsed-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). For the EPR study, the SBDs were labeled with a nitroxide radical (SBD-T). TE micrographs showed the vesicles as multilamellar structures of spherical shape with diameters ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 2 m. DLS measurements provided the mean vesicle diameter (d) at ca. 400 nm, whereas the diameter of generation 6 was 7 nm. No large-sized permanent supramolecular structures (d> 400 nm) were formed. EPR measurements at room temperature were poorly informative, since (1) {{a fraction of the}} dendrimers was not interacting with the vesicles, and (b) the labels that were interacting with the vesicles were rotating quickly around the main axis. Interactions between the dendrimers and the vesicles (tested by a decrease in rotational mobility of the label) became EPR-observable and quantifiable below the freezing <b>transition</b> of a <b>portion</b> of the solution, which could not be detected by EPR analysis. The fraction of the dendrimers interacting with the vesicles underwent a glass transition. Dendrimer-vesicle interactions modified the direction of the fast-rotation axis of the radical, and the interaction was more effective for protonated dendrimers of a large...|$|R
