40|$|Abstract__ In {{the course}} of history, {{flooding}} of rivers and the sea brought misery to humanity. Low lying delta’s of large rivers like Bangladesh, New Orleans, the Nile delta or the Netherlands belong to the most vulnerable for flood disasters. Since ancient times people pondered about strategies to avoid flood risks. During last decades of raising awareness about climate change, thinking about dealing with flood risks changed considerably in the Netherlands. The conceptual turnover suits in a broader development towards integrated and interactive water management. Here ‘fighting against’ turned to ‘living with’ water. The way the new perspectives on flood management in the Netherlands developed, is the central theme of this paper. How does thinking about flood management evolve? An analysis of the different policy visions and documents shows the incremental change. Interviews with decision-makers and professional water managers confirms {{that it seems to}} be the <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> transition towards sustainable, or interactive, flood management...|$|E
40|$|As {{clearly stated}} by the Conference's proposal, {{after a decade}} of European urban and spatial policies, it seems the <b>time</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> deeper {{reflection}} on their influences in spatial and urban planning practices in the EU countries. A brief survey on what concerns Italy allows us to observe that EU planning intervention has affected practically all the levels of territorial government, through many dimensions of what is first and foremost a material innovation, triggered as if by contamination by the arrival on the scene of the new institutional player. Changes are mainly visible in: - the shaping of spatial frameworks for planning policies; - the proliferation of new, different tools for regional and urban planning; - a progressive re-equilibrium between "central" and "peripheral" regions; - new institutional and administrative attitudes to negotiation and partnership; - the cultural way of treating urban problems and conceiving planning; - new emerging competences and "jobs" for planners. A reflection on the deepest meaning of those many changes - and, more generally, on the substantial reasons of the (not institutionalised) EU intervention in planning policies - could contribute to better understanding on what, not only in Italy, can be expected from EU planning and what, consequently, can be improved in European development strategie...|$|E

CD 40 ligand deficiency is X-linked form of the disease, which results in a lack of immunoglobulin class switching from IgM to IgG in B cells.

The present study elaborates the potential of a previously isolated phage with biocontrol capability, to survive and adsorb in various physicochemical environments. ΦSP- 3, a Salmonella specific lytic phage capable of infecting host in nutrient deprived states with an added advantage of high host specificity and absence of virulence genes as previously reported was chosen for the study. Salmonella Enteritidis was used as host. Basic growth parameters like time taken for phage adsorption, optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) and one step growth curve, were determined, followed by physicochemical characterization. Various parameters studied include temperature, pH, salinity and presence of sugars and CaCl 2. 25 minutes of exposure time was required for 100 % adsorption and optimal MOI was calculated as one. The latent period and the rise period was 30 minutes each with a subsequent burst size of 60 phages per bacterium. ΦSP- 3 could survive upto 70 ºC. 1 M NaCl was optimal for phage viability while 0. 25 M favored maximal adsorption. The optimum pH for ΦSP- 3 viability and adsorption was 8. Among the sugars,Arabinose was most influential in inactivating ΦSP- 3. 100 % adsorption was achieved at both 37 ºC and at 40 ºC. 10 mM of CaCl 2 to be optimum for ΦSP- 3.

40|$|We {{take our}} {{world to be}} an {{objective}} reality, but is it? The assumption that the physical world exists {{in and of itself}} has struggled to assimilate the findings of modern physics <b>for</b> some <b>time</b> <b>now.</b> <b>For</b> example, <b>an</b> objective space and time would just "be", but in relativity, space contracts and time dilates. Likewise objective "things" should just inherently exist, but the entities of quantum theory are probability of existence smears, that spread, tunnel, superpose and entangle in physically impossible ways. Cosmology even tells us that our entire physical universe just "popped up", from nowhere, about 14 billion years ago. This is not how an objectively real world should behave! Yet traditional alternatives don't work much better. That the world is just an illusion of the mind doesn't explain its consistent realism and Descartes dualism, that another reality beyond the physical exists, just doubles the existential problem. It is time to consider an option we might normally dismiss out of hand. This essay explores the virtual reality conjecture, that the physical world is the digital output of non-physical quantum processing. It finds it neither illogical, nor unscientific, nor incompatible with current physics. In this model, quantum entities are programs, movement is the transfer of processing, interactions are processing overloads and the fields of physics are network properties. It has no empty space, no singularities and all the conservations of physics just conserve processing. Its prediction, that the collision of high frequency light in a vacuum can create permanent matter, will test it. If the physical world has the properties of a processing output, physics must rewrite the story behind its equations.
