2500|$|There is no set {{format for}} jury deliberations, {{and the jury}} takes {{a period of time}} to settle into {{discussing}} the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine. [...] Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present. [...] The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors' views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion. [...] Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial. [...] The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved. [...] In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.|$|E

When an English jury has to choose between a plain fact ON the surface and a long explanation UNDER the surface, it always takes the fact in preference to the explanation. For example, Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's sake) declares she has slept at a certain house, and it is proved that she has not slept at that house. You explain this circumstance by entering into the state of her mind, and deducing from it a metaphysical conclusion.

6000|$|Was he in Mrs. Farnaby's confidence, on {{the subject}} of her {{domestic}} differences with her husband? Did those differences lead to her withdrawing herself from her husband's roof? Did Mrs. Farnaby inform him of the place of her retreat? To these three questions the witness, speaking quite readily in each case, answered Yes. Asked next, what the nature of the 'domestic differences' had been; whether they were likely to affect Mrs. Farnaby's mind seriously; why she had passed under an assumed name, and why she had confided the troubles of her married life to a young man like himself, only introduced to her a few months since, the witness simply declined to reply to the inquiries addressed to him.

'His {{advice is}} the same as that which, as I {{mentioned}} this afternoon, Levine gave when I told him of the circumstances, and which I have no doubt he will repeat when he has further thought the matter over, namely, that unless we can obtain some evidence to support your denial, we have no chance of obtaining a verdict if we go into court. Danvers says that, of course, to those who know you, the idea of your taking these diamonds is absolutely preposterous; still, as <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> not know you, and the public who read the report will not know you, they can only go by the evidence. He says that trying to {{look at it as a}} stranger, his opinion would be that it was an extraordinary case, but that unless we believed thoroughly that you had not taken the things, we should never have taken so hopeless a case into court. Still, he thinks that the verdict of those who only look at the outside of things would be that the denial was almost worse than the act. Had it not been for the unfortunate rumours previously circulated, many people might be of opinion that it was a case of kleptomania, and that no woman in her senses would have thus openly carried the things away from a place where she was well known.' ...|$|E
