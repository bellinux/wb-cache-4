5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a whiskey trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's {{nickname}} became Fort Whoop-Up. The whiskey trade led to <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Hills Massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873. The North-West Mounted Police, sent {{to stop the}} trade and establish order, arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October 1874. They managed the post for the next 12 years.|$|E
5|$|The Poinciana Parkway is a two-lane, controlled-access toll highway, {{designed}} to be expanded to a four-lane expressway, that runs between the Polk-Osceola County line and <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Parkway (CR 580) in Poinciana, with a large section crossing undeveloped swampland. The highway is contiguous with Kinney Harmon Road in Polk County, which connects the Poinciana Parkway with US 17/US 92 in Loughman. Across US 17/92, the road continues as the Ronald Reagan Parkway (former County Road 54), which provides indirect access from the Poinciana Parkway to Interstate 4.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina.

There are vines that are as wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes. Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E

5|$|The second-place bidder, Lane Construction Corporation, sued OCX {{after an}} {{appeal of the}} {{decision}} {{was rejected by the}} OCX board. Lane alleged that scoring of the bids were improperly skewed in Jr. Davis' favor and that the latter was not properly licensed. Lane's bid was cheaper, at $62million, but OCX determined that the Jr. Davis bridge design was superior. Lane did not succeed with the lawsuit and a notice to proceed, authorizing construction to begin, was issued in December 2013. To construct the bridge, a temporary haul road was constructed across the RCMB. The northern segment of the Poinciana Parkway, from US17/US92 to Marigold Avenue, opened to traffic on April 30, 2016; the southern segment of the Poinciana Parkway, from Marigold Avenue to <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Parkway, opened on November 18, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, {{a move that would}} effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way would be in the public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>cypress</b> domes and strands retain {{moisture}} and block out {{much of the}} sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E

5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation were killed in <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North-West Mounted Police {{with the intention of}} mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States might choose to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1808, Taylor {{joined the}} U.S. Army, {{receiving}} a commission {{as a first}} lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment. He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress {{in response to the}} Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship, sparking calls for war. Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs. Under the command of James Wilkinson, the soldiers at Terre aux Boeufs suffered greatly from disease and lack of supplies, and Taylor was given an extended leave, returning to Louisville to recover. Taylor was promoted to captain in November 1810. His army duties were limited at this time, and he attended to his personal finances. Over the next several years, he began to purchase slaves and a good deal of bank stock in Louisville. He bought a plantation in Louisville for $95,000 that had 83 slaves attached to it, as well as <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Grove Plantation near Rodney, Jefferson County, Mississippi, bringing the total number of slaves under him above 200. In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory, where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled. In only a few weeks, he was able to restore order in the garrison, for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison. Taylor was temporarily called to Washington to testify for Wilkinson as a witness in a court-martial, and so he did not take part in the November 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe against the forces of Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief.|$|E
25|$|Built in {{the late}} 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Street Viaduct, a stretch of Interstate 880, was a {{double-deck}} freeway section made of nonductile reinforced concrete that was constructed above and astride Cypress Street in Oakland. Roughly half of the land <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Viaduct was built on was filled marshland, and half was somewhat more stable alluvium. Because of new highway structure design guidelines—the requirement of ductile construction elements—instituted following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, a limited degree of earthquake reinforcement was retrofitted to <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Viaduct in 1977. The added elements were longitudinal restraints at transverse expansion joints in the box girder spans, but no studies were made of possible failure modes specific to <b>the</b> <b>Cypress</b> Viaduct. When the earthquake hit, the shaking was amplified on the former marshland, and soil liquefaction occurred.|$|E
