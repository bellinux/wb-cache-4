He flung me among old papers, smoking-caps, slippers, and other odds and ends into a box, where I have remained until to-night. A month or more ago he rummaged in the box for some old letters, and coming upon me unexpectedly, he jagged {{his finger on the}} wire. 'Where on earth did you come from?' he asked me. Then he remembered, and flung me back among the papers with a laugh. Now we come to to-night. An hour ago I heard him blowing down something, then stamping his feet. From his words I knew that his pipe was stopped. I heard him ring a bell and ask angrily who had gone off with his pipe-cleaners. He bustled through the room looking for them or for a substitute, and after a time he cried aloud, 'I have it; that would do; but where was it I saw the thing last?' He pulled out several drawers, looked through his desk, and then opened the box in which I lay. He tumbled its contents over until he found me, and then he pulled me out, exclaiming, 'Eureka!' My heart sank, for I understood all as I fell leaf by leaf on the hearth-rug where I now lie. He took <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>off</b> me and used it to clean his pipe." ...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{development}} in smart structures has enhanced the great efforts {{in understanding the}} mechanical and thermo-mechanical behaviour of shape-memory alloy (SMA) materials. SMAs, in <b>the</b> form of <b>wires</b> and strips, have been embedded into advanced composite structures to control the shape and residual stress of the structures. It is well recognised that the mechanical properties of embedded SMA composites are highly dependent on {{the integrity of the}} interface, particularly by the existence of high thermal-induced shear stress at the SMA wire/epoxy interface. This paper discusses the debonding failure mechanism of embedded pre-strained SMA wires in an epoxy matrix environment using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. It was found that debonds occurred at the SMA wire/matrix interface for a wire with a pre-strained level of 8 % at a temperature above A sub f.

The main focus in this study is on the application of reduced order modelling techniques and the development of the associated models for fast evaluation and analysis. The discussion is on methods for approximate response surface modelling based on interpolation techniques using Kriging and radial basis functions.

40|$|This work is {{directed}} towards realizing large scale shape changes of wing like structures. It {{is relevant to}} discuss the work carried out in this area so far. AMR BAZ (ref l) details the work in which SMA is embedded in sleeves located at the neutral planes and arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the composite beam. Here {{emphasis is placed on}} describing quasi-static theory of shape control and implementation of this theory to composites incorporated with SMA. Emphasis has been placed on full utilization of shape memory effect without compromising on structural stiffness of the composite beam. Koryo Miura et a 1 (ref. 2) explain about adaptive structures and their use in aerospace applications. Here a variable geometry (VG) truss concept is presented. Comparison is made between tetrahedral and octahedral truss elements. Since octahedral is richer in symmetry, it is considered to be adequate for adaptive structures. DC motor is used as an actuator. It is shown that VG truss is the basic form of adaptive structures. The basic formulations for its geometrical as well as vibrational properties are established. Some applications such as second generation manipulator arm, support architecture for a space station and others are discussed here. Deepak. S. Ramrakhyani et a 1 (ref. 3) explains about the use of compliant cellular truss where tendons are used as active elements. This tendon actuated elements can be used for local or global shape changes. Here an octahedral unit cell is developed for bending deformations and compliant joints are made of cylindrical elements of superelastic shape memory alloys. Several concepts of morphing skin were also presented. Tendon actuators are presently under development. The tendons could be actuated locally or combined from a remote location such as the root of the wing. Since we are looking for large deflection of thin beams we have deliberately embedded <b>the</b> SMA <b>wires</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> neutral axis of the beam. In the literatures there is hardly any material that deals with this type of an approach. In this the effect of embedding <b>the</b> thermal SMA <b>wires</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> neutral plane of thin beams was studied. These wires were prestrained and embedded off the neutral axis to produce high amount of recovery forces when electrically energized. Superelastic SMA (SESMA) wires were used {{on the other side of}} the beam so as to increase the spring back effect of the beam when de-energized. Thus we were able to obtain large deflection together with faster return back to original position when de-energized...|$|R

Electron impact ionization, thermal ionization, and three-body recombination have been considered as the charged particle production and loss mechanisms. The electrode surfaces {{are considered to be}} absorbing and the initial density of the particles is small, but nonzero, A gap length of 0. 5 mm is investigated and the gas medium is air or argon at atmospheric pressure. The temporal development of the profiles of ion and electron number densities, potential and electric field, and current growth on both the electrodes are presented when the applied voltage is 1500 and 2500 V for both positive and negative <b>wires.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> is negatively biased, the peaks in the radial distribution of both of the charged particle densities near <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> occur <b>off</b> <b>the</b> axis except during the very early part of the breakdown. With positive polarity, the electron density maximum always occurs on the discharge axis, while for ions it moves away from the axis, later in the transient, due to the reverse particle drift in the electric field from the negative polarity case, The discharge spreads farther out into the ambient (almost two times the gap length) when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> is negatively biased than with positive polarity.

The third area forms the core of the thesis. The key challenges in creating the virtual environment to train for generic sensor fault tolerant algorithms are considered and addressed. The evolved algorithms are analysed and then verified using the demonstrator in practice. The practical results showed that sensor fault tolerant control was successfully achieved. ...|$|R

The reduced order modeling approach uses prediction data for the electrothermomechanical behavior of <b>the</b> power module <b>wire</b> bond design obtained through nonlinear transient finite element simulations, in particular, for the fatigue lifetime of <b>the</b> aluminum <b>wire</b> attached to <b>the</b> silicon chip and the warpage (displacement) of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> in <b>the</b> module. These reduced order models are used for the analysis of the effect of design uncertainties on the reliability of these advanced electronics modules. To assess the effect of uncertain design data, different methods for estimating the variation of reliability-related metrics of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> bond model are researched and tested. Sample-based methods, such as full-scale Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube, and analytical approximate methods, such as first order second moment (FOSM) and point estimation method (PEM), are investigated, and their accuracy is compared. The optimization modeling analyzes the probabilistic nature of the reliability problem of <b>the</b> aluminum <b>wire</b> bond structures under investigation. Optimization tasks with design uncertainty are identified and solved using a particle swarm optimization algorithm. The probabilistic optimization deals with two different characteristic performance metrics of the design, the electrothermomechanical fatigue reliability of <b>the</b> aluminum <b>wire</b> attached to <b>the</b> chip and the thermally induced warpage of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> in <b>the</b> module structure. The objective in this analysis is to ensure that the design has the required reliability and meets a number of additional requirements...|$|R

40|$|Wire bonding {{is still}} the {{dominant}} interconnection technology for power semiconductors in power modules, e. g. for automotive or photovoltaic applications. In the past, many research activities {{have occurred in the}} field of reliability of power modules, where the life time of the complete module is affected by bond <b>wire</b> lift <b>offs,</b> heel cracks and other failures. Less effort was spent for investigating the degradation process at <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> bond itself. This paper addresses a new approach and focuses on the investigation of the cracks in the interface region between the die and <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> by using <b>the</b> shear test. These cracks form after several thousand temperature swings due to CTE mismatch and ultimately lead to <b>wire</b> bond lift <b>off.</b> New results of active power cycling with different temperature amplitudes and medium temperatures will be discussed. Shear tests have been carried out in regular intervals to monitor the degradation of <b>the</b> 400 m <b>wire</b> bonds on power MOS-FETs. It wa s found out that the rate of the shear force reduction was mostly dependent on the amplitude of the temperature cycling. A significant effect of different medium temperatures could not be identified. These results will {{contribute to the development of}} an enhanced life time model for heavy wire bonds on power semiconductors...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} in the inter-face between <b>the</b> heavy Al <b>wire</b> and <b>the</b> Al metallization of {{the power}} semiconductor {{is one of the}} major failure causes of power modules and discrete devices. These fatigue cracks are primarily caused by mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the Al of <b>the</b> bonding <b>wire</b> and <b>the</b> Si of the chip. During thermal cycling periodic plastic and elastic strains occur in the interface region weakening <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> material with every cycle. Typically this leads to the initiation and growth of cracks in the interface between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> and <b>the</b> metallization. The final result is a bond lift off and a failure of the device. The main influencing factors for this degradation are the temperature swing and the maximum temperature of <b>the</b> cycle, <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> material and diameter and <b>the</b> initial <b>wire</b> bond quality. In the past, many publications in this field were concentrated on the reliability of complete power modules with many wire bonds. In these works the degradation process of a single wire was not monitored. Only the final result of the degradation - <b>the</b> bond <b>wire</b> lift <b>off</b> - was considered. To gain more insight into the degradation process in the interface between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> bond and <b>the</b> chip metallization, crack initiation and growth has to be monitored on a single wire basis. Since electrical measurements of cracks lengths in the micrometer range are not feasible and common inspection methods such as X-Ray and Acoustic Microscopes do not deliver high enough spatial resolution only metallographic cross sectioning followed by SEM or light microscope inspection can reveal the correct crack length and possibly the grain structure around the crack tip. Metallographic cross sectioning is a manual step and thus very time consuming. It is feasible only for a small number of samples but on a power semiconductor many wires (up to 20) are bonded in parallel to increase current capability and reliability of the module. In this case, cross sectioning of every wire is not possible. Typically the interface quality of heavy wire bonds right after the bonding process is evaluated by the shear test. During the shear test, a shear tool is shearing through <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> material at a defined height above the pad metallization. The measured shear force and the coverage of the sheared bond site with wire material give a clue about the bonding quality. If during thermal cycling a crack is initiated and growing this must be detectable by decreasing shear forces and coverage of the shear site. For this reason the shear test is used for detecting the crack growth. In this poster shear results after power cycling with different temperature swings and maximum temperatures are presented. In addition, cross sections and microstructure analyses reveal that the exact path of the crack is not directly in <b>the</b> interface between <b>wire</b> and metallization but in a layer above the interface. This layer is characterized by fine grains below and coarse grains above. Also, the analysis of the crack tip area shows mainly intercrystalline crack growth...|$|R
