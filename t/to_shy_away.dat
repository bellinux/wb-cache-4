This film had been planned since 1946, but production was delayed due {{to a combination of}} difficulties with the censor, and Paramount's reluctance for Ladd to play such a challenging part. It was not a big success at the box office and its mixed critical and commercial reception caused Ladd <b>to</b> <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> from serious dramatic roles afterwards.|$|E

McNulty seems to accept this with good grace, but tries to help the detail unofficially. Daniels persuades Rawls to let McNulty return by taking on the murders of the fourteen women. McNulty's first assignment is to go undercover as a client visiting a local brothel, much to the amusement of his colleagues. He also flirts with Russell, who has been assigned to Daniels' detail, though he seems <b>to</b> <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> from a relationship.|$|E

George commissioned him to illustrate Rosemary Sutcliff's historical children's novel The Silver Branch. He was unenthused by the ancient Roman subject matter, but experimented with double page spreads and drawings in the margins, and was quickly assigned more books by Sutcliff and others, including Henry Treece. This began a professional relationship with Oxford University Press, for whom he illustrated more books than for any other publisher. Keeping, along with Victor Ambrus, established a new, exuberant style of illustration for children's historical fiction, refusing <b>to</b> <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> from the violence of warfare.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} the RUF was a depleted threat, civilians {{were able to}} return from refugee camps and begin rebuilding their lives. But the peace was fragile and negotiations were ongoing. The RUF was reluctant to put down their arms, concerned over potential retribution {{at the hands of}} army units and civilian militias alike. There was a planned deployment of UN peacekeepers meant to ease these concerns and help with the transition to peace, but things began to unravel. International contributors began <b>to</b> <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> from further peacekeeping initiatives; such as an expensive and open-ended mission in a strategically unimportant country. As a result, the UN's intervention force was slow to come to fruition and then came to a halt completely when Sankoh argued the size of the contingent of 740 UN peacekeepers was too large.|$|E

Of the latter respondents, 19% considered the bias to be pro-protest and 11% identified it as pro-government. The electronic and print media in Bulgaria are generally regarded as tending <b>to</b> <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> from publishing materials explicitly critical of governments, but businessman and direct democracy supporter Petar Klisarov insists that the main media were passive and relatively objective in their reporting of the 2013 anti-Borisov protests while {{from the very beginning}} they unequivocally took the side of the protesters in their coverage of the anti-Oresharski movement. According to academic Orlin Spasov, the protests saw significantly more intra-societal cleavages (Russophiles vs. Russophobes, communists vs. anti-communists and so on) compared to the winter discontent against Borisov's cabinet that mainly juxtaposed the political elites against the people, which made it much more difficult for the media anchors to cover them.|$|E

Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: [...] "All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats.

[...] This was in reference to two singing contests being held during that timeSearch for the Star in a Million on ABS-CBN and Pinoy Pop Superstar on GMA Network. Initially, the program was scheduled to begin on July 29, 2006, but ABC moved it to July 30, 2006.

500|$|On {{retirement}} as a player, O'Reilly {{became a}} cricket columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, remaining {{in that position}} until his health declined in 1988. [...] His first engagement was England's tour of Australia in 1946–47, and during this season he began {{a partnership with the}} Daily Express of London, going on to cover several Ashes series for them. O'Reilly's articles for The Sydney Morning Herald were reproduced in its sister publication, The Age of Melbourne. Later, his writing was syndicated to newspapers in India, South Africa and New Zealand. His style was described by Wisden as [...] "muscular, very Australian... flavoured with wit and imagery ('You can smell the gum-leaves off him', he wrote of one country boy just starting with Queensland)." [...] Jack McHarg said that [...] "The clarity, wit and pungency of his writing, together with almost infallible judgment, never deserted him", even as his health began to restrict him. He was a highly respected and forthright pundit, who hated one-day cricket, describing it as [...] "hit and giggle". He condemned the omission of Keith Miller in 1949–50 and said that to call it [...] "a complete surprise would be a cowardly way of describing a botch". Reacting to the selection of the dour batting all rounder Ken Mackay, he wrote [...] "words fail...to express adequately my contempt for this howler". In 1952 he had a falling-out with Lindwall after condemning his protégé for bowling five consecutive bouncers at Everton Weekes in a Test. In comparison with his illustrious contemporary on-field and on paper, [...] "while Sir Donald walked the corridors of cricketing power O'Reilly was the rumbustious backbencher." [...] In 1956, O'Reilly strongly criticised Australian captain Ian Johnson, a Melburnian, for his leadership during the 1956 Ashes tour. The Age took exception to this and asked their sister publication to rein in their pundit. O'Reilly refused <b>to</b> <b>shy</b> <b>away</b> from his opinions and was dropped by the Melbourne publication. In the 1980s, when Bob Simpson became the first coach of Australia, O'Reilly, himself self-taught, spoke out against the creation of such posts. He was a strong critic of the breakaway World Series Cricket, the commercialisation of the sport and the erosion of the social norms that were followed during his playing career.|$|E

It also did not help that the band did not stick to a style and give it chance to succeed before trying something new. Diamond Head never performed in the U.S.A until 2002, by which time everything had changed.|$|E
