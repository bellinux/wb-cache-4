40|$|Summary: <b>Tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen,</b> {{measured}} by both a polyclonal antibody (TPA IRMA Prolifigen®) and a monoclonal antibody prototype kit (TPA-M IRMA Prolifigen®), and the tissue polypeptide specific antigen were evaluated. The markers were measured in 266 serum samples and in 291 tumour cytosols from patients with primary breast cancer. The three markers {{were available in}} matched pairs of both serum and cytosol from the same patient in 144 cases. Diagnostic sensitivity of serum levels of the three markers was not significantly different when using cut-off values calculated {{on the basis of}} healthy subjects. In the cytosol, <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA IRMA), <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA-M IRMA) and tissue polypeptide specific antigen were significantly correlated with steroid receptor Status, while their serum levels were not. Cytosol and serum levels of the three markers were not significantly associated. All three were significantly corre-lated both in serum and in cytosol. The association was closer between <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA IRMA) and <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA-M IRMA) than between each of these two markers and tissue polypeptide specific antigen. From these findings we dfäw the following conclusions: 1. Tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPA IRMA) and <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA-M IRMA) probably provide superimposable information both in serum and in cytosol; 2. Tissue polypeptide specific antigen and <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA IRMA) or <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA^M IRMA), although closely associated, probably measure in part different cytokeratins. Therefore, they should not be considered interchangeable in individual patients; 3. The determination of the markers in serum and in cytosol provides diiferent information concerning the tumour phenotype...|$|E

This is the first clinical study specifically designed to compare <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> and CA 125 tumour associated antigen. Three hundred and eighty-four new lung cancer patients (309 males) were studied at their first clinical presentation and then strictly followed-up. Anthropometric, clinical and laboratory data – including <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> and CA 125 tumour associated antigen serum levels – were prospectively recorded. A total of 1000 <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> and CA 125 tumour associated antigen serum assays (384 pre-treatment and 616 posttreatment assays) were performed. Both <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> and CA 125 tumour associated antigen correlated significantly with the T, N and M stage descriptors at diagnosis (Rho: 0. 200, 0. 203, 0. 263 and 0. 181, 0. 240, 0. 276, respectively), {{and then with the}} objective response to treatment (Rho: 0. 388 and 0. 207, respectively). A pleural neoplastic involvement was mainly associated to an increase of CA 125 tumour associated antigen (Rho: 0. 397). Both <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> and CA 125 tumour associated antigen were strongly predictive of the patients' outcome, as assessed by the univariate analysis of survival (log-rank test: 37. 24 and 29. 01) and several Cox' proportional hazards regression models.

The {{aim of this study}} was to validate in patients suffering from NonAlcoholic SteatoHepatitis the clinical utility of this marker after different programs of weight reduction. METHODS: Overweight/obese patients with visceral adiposity and liver histology compatible were assigned to a Calorically-Restricted diet (n = 22), a Calorically-Restricted diet plus EXercise (n = 19) or No Healthy Life Style (control group, n = 21) for six months. The presence of Body-Weight loss was assessed by a Body Mass Index decrease of at least three points. Serum ALanine aminoTransferase, HOmeostasis Model Assessment method value and <b>Tissue</b> <b>Polypeptide</b> Specific <b>antigen</b> concentrations were determined at time 0, after 3 and 6 months in both the Intervention groups and in the controls' one. RESULTS: In NonAlcoholic SteatoHepatitis patients who obtained Body-Weight reduction, a significant decrease of the serum <b>Tissue</b> <b>Polypeptide</b> Specific <b>antigen</b> values was showed with a clear linear trend across time, P = 0. 0001. Decrement of <b>Tissue</b> <b>Polypeptide</b> Specific <b>antigen</b> concentrations best differentiated the Body-Weight loss from the body-weight maintenance in respect to <b>Tissue</b> <b>Polypeptide</b> Specific <b>antigen</b> and HOmeostasis Model Assessment method values.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between renal function and the blood level of some tumor markers that are low molecular weight proteins, that is, tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI), squamous cells carcinoma antigen (SCC), cytokeratin 19 fragments (CYFRA 21 - 1), <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA), and M 3 -specific epitope of <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPS). In 41 adult patients without evidence of neoplastic disease, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the blood levels of creatinine and of the tumor markers were determined. The decrease in GFR was accompanied by an increase in serum levels of TATI, SCC, CYFRA 21 - 1, and TPA. The serum level of tumor markers increased particularly when GFR fell below 40 ml/min.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Copious {{literature}} {{shows that}} in lung cancer many serum markers, especially the cytokeratin degradation products, correlate with the extent of disease. In 1995, we suggested the possibility of predicting the resectability of non–small cell lung cancer by measuring the plasma level of the <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen,</b> a marker of the cytokeratin family. This study was designed (1) to confirm the earlier data in a new prospective evaluation, (2) to comparatively assess another classic biomarker (ie, the carcinoembryonic antigen), and (3) to incorporate their results into the preoperative evaluation of non–small cell lung cancer. Methods: We analyzed the database of a single institution over a 5 -year period (1994 - 1998) in a community-based hospital and second referral level institution for a province of 500, 000 people. The database included 124 consecutive patients (105 men) with pathologically documented lung cancer (50 % with adenocarcinoma) accurately staged, clinically judged operable or potentially operable, and eventually operated on. Anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory data (including the carcinoembryonic antigen and <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> serum levels) {{and the results of}} a complex staging workup were prospectively recorded. Receiver-operating characteristic curves and diagnostic formulas were used for data analysis. Results: Computed tomography of the thorax, upper part of the abdomen, and brain was the most accurate preoperative method to assess tumor resectability (receiver-operating characteristic area: 0. 76, 95 % confidence intervals: 0. 67 - 0. 86, P =. 000; accuracy rate: 77 %, confidence intervals: 69 %- 84 %). <b>Tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> was also predictive for tumor resectability (receiver-operating characteristic area: 0. 62, 95 % confidence intervals: 0. 51 - 0. 73, P =. 035; accuracy rate at a threshold level of 110 U/L: 65 %, 95 % confidence intervals: 56 %- 73 %). Carcinoembryonic antigen was diagnostic only at the extreme values of its distribution (accuracy rate at a level up to 10 ng/mL: 69 %, 95 % confidence intervals: 60 %- 77 %). The probability of finding resectable disease {{at the time of the}} operation increased from 78 % (baseline computed tomography–based probability) to 83 % when the concentration of <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> was lower than 90 U/L and to 85 % when the concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen was below 10 ng/mL. The probability of discovering an advanced disease increased from 68 % (baseline computed tomography–based probability) to 89 % when <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> levels were abnormal and to 100 % when carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations were higher than 10 ng/mL. Conversely, the predictability of computed tomography was diminished by contrasting biomarker results, requiring further clinical investigations. Conclusions: Computed tomography remains the gold standard for the preoperative evaluation of non–small cell lung cancer, although it may significantly underestimate the real tumor extension. The addition of the easy and inexpensive <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> test (with or without carcinoembryonic antigen) is capable of correcting this underestimation and helps to decide whether to completely rely on computed tomography or order additional clinical investigations.

40|$|Background: Malignant {{melanoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} malignant types of skin cancer. Incidences are on the rise worldwide and in the Czech Republic an increase of 5 % in diagnosed cases is noted each year. Early detection and early surgical removal are associated with reduced mortality. The strong aggressiveness of this malignant disease is caused by its local invasive growth and tendency to metastasize early. Aim of the study: The malignant melanoma is highly metabolically active tumor that releases a number of enzymes, cytokines, growth hormones and other molecules. The aim of this work was to determine the usability of preoperative and postoperative serum and plasma levels of biomarkers in primary diagnosis of tumor activity and in the postoperative follow-up care. These findings would be of clinical relevance for the patient's prognosis, modification of multimodal treatment and follow-up of patients with malignant melanoma. Methods: We measured circulating levels of several biomarkers in a group of 77 patients with malignant melanoma and cohort of 34 patients without cancer as a control group.

40|$|Introduction: Although {{numerous}} tumour markers {{are available}} for periampullary tumours, including pancreatic cancer, their specificity and sensitivity have been questioned. Materials and methods: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic values of <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> specific <b>antigen</b> (TPS), carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) we took serum samples in 56 patients with mass lesions in the pancreatic head. Among these patients, further investigations revealed pancreatic cancer in 20 patients, other malignant diseases in 12 and benign conditions in 24. Results: Median CEA in all patients was 3. 4 microg/L (range 0. 5 - 585. 0), median CA 19 - 9 was 105 kU/L (range 0. 6 - 1 300 00), median TPS 123. 5 U/L (range 15. 0 - 3350) and median VEGF-A 132. 5 ng/L (range 60. 0 - 4317). Area under the curve was 0. 747, standard error (standard error [SE] = 0. 075) for CEA, 0. 716 (SE= 0. 078) for CA 19 - 9 and 0. 822 (SE= 0. 086) for TPS in ROC plots based {{on the ability of}} the tumours to distinguish between benign and malignant conditions.

40|$|Background: One major {{impediment}} {{to improving the}} management of breast cancer is the current lack of tumor marker with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. A {{growing body of evidence}} implicates the diagnostic potential of circulating miRNAs in cancer detection. MiR- 155 {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of breast cancer. However, the level of circulating miR- 155 and its clinical relevance are not well established. The objective of the current study was to learn more about serum miR- 155 in patients with breast cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we demonstrated that serum miR- 155 had significant increased levels in breast cancer patients (n = 103) compared with healthy subjects (n = 55) (p, 0. 001), which had a mean fold change of 2. 94. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that miR- 155 had considerable diagnostic accuracy, yielding an ROC-AUC (the areas under the ROC curve) of 0. 801 (sensitivity 65. 0 %, specificity 81. 8 %). In addition, sera from a subset of breast cancer patients (n = 29) were collected after surgery and after four cycles of chemotherapy to evaluate the effects of clinical treatment on serum levels of candidate miRNAs. Surprisingly, a decreased level of serum miR- 155 was found; whereas the concentrations of carbohydrate antigen 15 - 3 (CA 15 - 3), carcinoembryonic <b>antigen</b> (CEA) and <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> specific <b>antigen</b> (TPS) did not show this trend.

40|$|AIM [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> specific (TPS) <b>antigen</b> for the early detection of cyclosporin A (CyA) induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases. METHODS [...] Serum concentrations of TPS antigen were analysed using a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay and whole blood CyA concentrations were measured using high pressure liquid chromatography. Infection with Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus was detected by determining levels of IgM and IgG antibodies directed against viral capsid antigen (VCA). Immunohistochemistry and analysis of clonality were carried out on formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue. RESULTS [...] The mean serum concentration of TPS antigen in the eight transplant recipients investigated was 60 U/l during periods without complication (control), 101 U/l during infection, 166 U/l when the diagnosis of a lymphoma was confirmed, and 172 U/l when lymphoma and infection coincided. Increased TPS antigen concentrations were detected in six patients one month before detection of malignancy.

40|$|TPS (<b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> {{specific}} <b>antigen)</b> is a well−documented {{tumor marker}} for epithelial malignancies. It measures an antigenic determinant associated with human cytokeratin 18, utilizing an epitope {{defined by the}} monoclonal antibody M 3. TPS is a marker of tumor cell activity, rather than the more commonly used markers related to tumor burden. The main clinical value of TPS lies in early detection of recurrent disease and in rapid assessment of treat− ment efficacy. Decreasing TPS levels during therapy monitoring indicate response and {{in case of a}} fast decrease, a favorable prognosis is often indicated. Further, increasing TPS levels in patients with clinically stable disease or partial remission is a reliable indicator of progression with a considerable lead time. When tumor marker determi− nations are applied in a proper way in the appropriate situation, the biomarker results can assist the oncologist. TPS {{has been shown to be}} of value in gastrointestinal malignancies, the site of more cancers than any other body organ system as exemplified by colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. In advanced colorectal cancer, TPS is a power− ful parameter during post−surgical follow−up and in monitoring palliative treatment. TPS levels significantly cor− relate with clinical outcome and therapy response. TPS is associated with aggressive disease and provide also prog− nostic information in colorectal cancer. In pancreatic cancer, TPS is a valuable indicator of the malignant process, important as a highly discriminative marker for differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancre− atitis.

40|$|Objective: To explore Hongteng Yangwei {{decoction}} {{on patients}} with gastric cancer serum associated antigen (MG 7 -Ag), pepsin (PG), <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> specific <b>antigen</b> (TPS) and osteopontin (OPN) levels, {{so as to}} {{provide the basis for}} treatment of gastric cancer. Method: From April 2012 to April 2015 due to gastric cancer received treatment of 90 cases of patients into the study, and then balance divided into group A, group B, group C, 30 cases of each group. Group A patients took Hongteng Yangwei decoction treatment, group B taking Wei Fu Chun pills treatment, group C with western medicine treatment. Before treatment for all patients, after January, the treatment of February after the detection, the main indicators of detection MG 7 -Ag, PG, TPS and OPN. Result: Level comparison MG 7 -Ag and SFAS in patients who received treatment before treatment, 1 month, 2 months of serum MG 7 -Ag detection after treatment patients were lower than those before treatment, difference had statistical significance: group A, patients taking Yangwei decoction treatment group C, B group of patients, the difference had no statistical significance. Treatment for 1 month, 2 months, a group of patients with serum PG levels higher than before treatment, and higher than that of B and C groups of patients, the differences were statistically significant. Serum levels of OPN and TPS level was significantly lower than that before treatment, difference was statistically significant, a group of patients with serum OPN, TPS level lower than B and C groups of patients, the difference was statistically significant. Conclusion: For the patients with gastric cancer Hongteng Yangwei decoction, serum levels of OPN and TPS decreased significantly. Serum PG increased, effect was significant, the patient serum MG 7 -Ag level with the western medicine, Wei Fu Chun pills in efficacy had no significant change, should be further in-depth study...|$|R
40|$|Serum TATI (tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor) was {{measured}} in 41 control subjects, 30 patients with pancreatic cancer, 53 with chronic pancreatitis, and 47 with extrapancreatic diseases, mainly of gastrointestinal origin. TATI {{was found to be}} elevated in some subjects in all groups of patients; patients with chronic pancreatitis studied during an acute exacerbation of the disease had the highest percentage (68 %) of pathological values. TATI was found to be correlated with elastase 1, <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen,</b> and total and pancreatic isoamylase. A significant relationship was also found between TATI and serum creatinine levels...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the predictive performance of serial <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA) testing after curative intent resection for detection of recurrence of colorectal malignancy. Methods: Serum samples were obtained in 572 patients from three different hospitals during follow-up after surgery. Test characteristics of serial TPA testing were assessed using a cut-off value of 75 U/L. The relation with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and the potential additive value of <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> testing upon standard carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing were investigated. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of TPA for recurrent disease was 0. 70, indicating marginal usefulness as a predictive test. Forty percent of cases that were detected by CEA testing would have been missed by TPA testing alone, whilst most cases missed by CEA were also not detected by TPA testing. In the subpopulation of patients with stage III disease predictive performance was good (area under the curve 0. 92 within 30 days of diagnosing recurrent disease). In this group of patients, 86 % of cases that were detected by CEA were also detected by TPA. Conclusions: Overall, TPA is a relatively poor predictor for recurrent disease during follow-up. When looking at the specific subpopulation of patients with stage III disease predictive performance of TPA was good. However, TPA testing was not found to be superior to CEA testing in this specific subpopulation...|$|E
40|$|The tumour markers {{carcinoembryonic antigen}} (CEA), <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (TPA), TPS, CA 19 - 9, CA 50 and CA 242 were {{analysed}} in serum from 203 potentially curable colorectal cancer patients. The levels of all markers increased with increasing tumour stage, and all markers correlated with survival. Multivariate analyses {{indicated that the}} Dukes stage had the best prognostic explanatory power, followed by TPA. In the subset of 166 potentially cured patients, the prognostic information by the markers was substantially reduced. We conclude that preoperative serum tumour marker measurements {{have the potential to}} aid therapy selection, but also that their clinical usefulness is not immediately apparent...|$|E
40|$|Several <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigens</b> of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi are {{recognized}} by human or primate convalescent sera {{and may be}} important protective immunogens. Molecular cloning and expression of the genes encoding the 110 K (110 kilodalton) and 56 K <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigens</b> of R. tsutsugamushi Karp were accomplished in the lambda gt 11 expression vector system. Southern blot analysis with the cloned fragments for the 56 K <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (0. 7 kilobases) and the 110 K <b>polypeptide</b> <b>antigen</b> (5. 4 kilobases) confirmed that the insert DNA was rickettsial and not host cell in origin. Expression of a complete 110 K polypeptide was shown to be independent of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction, suggesting that an intact rickettsial promoter was operational. Epitopes of the 56 K polypeptide were expressed as lac promoter-dependent beta-galactosidase fusion proteins. Polyclonal antibody, affinity purified against the recombinant 110 K and 56 K polypeptides, reacted with polypeptides of similar size in the Kato and Gilliam strains of R. tsutsugamushi. Group-reactive, but not strain-specific, monoclonal antibodies against the 56 K polypeptide reacted with the cloned portion of the 56 K polypeptide. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the cloned 56 K Karp antigen gene product is recognized by human convalescent serum...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship of}} serum pulmonary surfactant-associated pretein (SP-D), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), matrix metalloproteinases- 9 (MMP- 9), <b>tissue</b> <b>polypeptide</b> specific <b>antigen</b> (TPS) and lung adenocarcinoma-related antigen (KL- 6) with the effect and survival of treating advanced recurrent {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC), and to establish a survival predication model. Methods: ELISA was applied to detect peripheral serum SP-D, TGF-α, MMP- 9, TPS and KL- 6 levels in 114 patients with recurrent NSCLC, and to analyze their relationship with the effect of erlotinib by combining with clinical symptoms, while one-way and multi-way analysis of variances were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox multi-way survival analysis model in order to establish the survival predication model. Results: The total effective rate and stability rate of erlotinib in 114 patients were 22. 8 % and 72. 8 % with progression-free survival (PFS) and 1 -year survival rate being 5. 13 months and 69. 3 %, respectively, and they were higher in SP-D > 110 ng/mL group than in ≤ 110 ng/mL group (P＝ 0. 011, P ＝ 0. 017). The stability rate in MMP- 9 ≤ 535 ng/mL and TPS 535 ng/mL (P ＝ 0. 009) and TPS ≥ 80 U/L groups (P ＝ 0. 002) respectively, while mPFS in SP-D > 110 ng/mL, MMP- 9 ≤ 535 ng/mL, KL- 6 535 ng/mL (5. 83 months vs. 3. 47 months, P ＝ 0. 046), KL- 6 ≥ 500 U/mL (6. 03 months vs. 3. 40 months, P ＝ 0. 040) and TPS ≥ 80 U/L groups (6. 15 months vs. 2. 42 months, P＝ 0. 014), respectively. Cox multi-way analysis showed that smoking history, wild EGFR genes, effective progression of terminal chemotherapy, free-of-rash during erlotinib treatment, increased LDH and TPS ≥ 80 U/L were independent risk factors for PFS. Additionally, patients were divided into 4 groups according to the predicative indexes in prognostic predication model: low risk group,medium-low risk group, medium risk group and high risk group, with PFS being 9. 12, 6. 88, 3. 52 and 0. 93 months, respectively, and there were significant differences (P ＝ 0. 000). Conclusion: The establishment of prognostic survival model by detecting TPS level in serum tumor markers combined with clinical symptoms is of great significance in guiding and predicating erlotinib treatment on patients with recurrent NSCLC in clinic...|$|R
