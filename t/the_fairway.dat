25|$|Grass on {{golf courses}} {{is kept in}} three {{distinct}} conditions: that of the rough, <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> and the putting green. Grass on <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball. Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses.|$|E
25|$|As a way {{of opening}} his first course design in the UK (Chart Hills in Kent), Faldo teed up on the dog-leg right par five. He drove into the middle-right of <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> he then teed another ball and drove off, the two balls {{finished}} within 6inches {{of each other and}} to this day can be seen set into <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> in a protective case. This was a mark of the man's golfing ability at his peak. Faldo also worked on several overseas golf courses like The Fortress at Louisbourg Resort Golf & Spa on Cape Breton Island, Canada. Most recently, he designed a world-class course in San Miguel de Allende, México. Ventanas de San Miguel hosts an 18-hole par-70 course that was opened in late 2010.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other courses}} in Oklahoma, Oak Tree {{is a very}} windy course and can often have winds of at least 30 miles per hour (48km/h).

25|$|At the 2006 Open Championship, Woods almost {{exclusively}} used long irons {{off the tee}} (he hit driver only one time the entire week—the 16th hole of the first round), he missed just four fairways all week (hitting <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> 92% of the time), and his score of −18 to par (three eagles, 19 birdies, 43 pars, and seven bogeys) was just one off of his major championship record −19, set at St Andrews in 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). The victory was an emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father's memory.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{relatively}} flat course with medium-sized greens. The greens are traditionally known for being real smooth and fast. The oak and pine trees form tree-lines along <b>the</b> <b>fairways.</b> There are grass and sand bunkers around the greens and on <b>the</b> <b>fairways.</b> There are about four to five bunkers per hole. Water hazards (three ponds) come into play on six holes. The signature hole is #16, a 150-yard, par 3, requiring a tee shot over water to a green that is surrounded by trees and bunkers.|$|R
50|$|Ruth Park Golf Course has {{a unique}} design that uses the {{slightly}} hilly terrain. <b>The</b> <b>fairways</b> are very wide throughout, but the greens are quite small. Several holes have out of bounds to the right off the tee. The course has undergone some work as of late to improve <b>the</b> <b>fairways,</b> and <b>the</b> transition to completely zoysia fairways, with bent grass greens. The second, sixth, and seventh hole are tree lined. There is a small practice putting green {{to go along with}} the driving range.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, Mickelson won the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial with a −14, {{one shot}} ahead of Tim Clark and Rod Pampling. Mickelson shot a first-round 65 {{to start off}} the tournament at −5. He ended the day tied with Brett Wetterich, two shots behind leader, Johnson Wagner. Mickelson shot a second round 68, and the third round 65, overall, being −12 {{for the first three}} rounds. On the final hole, after an {{absolutely}} horrendous tee shot, he was in thick rough with trees in his way. Many players would have punched out, and taken their chances at making par from <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> with a good wedge shot. Instead, he pulled out a high-lofted wedge and hit his approach shot over a tree, landing on the green where he one-putted for the win.|$|E
25|$|Camilo Villegas had {{his best}} major {{finish with a}} tie for fourth, which was his second top 10 finish at the 2008 majors. He backed up his 67 earlier {{in the third round}} with a two-under 68 to finish four strokes behind Harrington. J. B. Holmes, who was one shot back to start the final round, triple bogeyed the first hole en route to an 11-over-par 81. Henrik Stenson had his second {{straight}} top 5 at the majors despite shooting a two-over 72 to fall into a tie with Villegas. Steve Flesch found the cup from <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> on the 18th to become the first on the day to birdie the hole. He finished by himself in sixth place and recorded his second top 10 finish at the majors in 2008. Phil Mickelson birdied three of his first four holes to put himself in contention, but did not birdie another hole and fell into a tie for seventh with Andrés Romero. Romero was unable to back up the 65 he shot in the third round and never mustered up a challenge for the leaders.|$|E
25|$|MD 192 {{from the}} 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) west to Seminary Road was paved as a macadam road by 1923. The macadam road was {{extended}} to Kensington by 1927. MD 192's original western terminus was at St. Paul Avenue, which was the original course of MD 193. The highway was extended west along Metropolitan Avenue and Plyers Mill RoadMD 193 (now MD 185) was relocated around the center of Kensington after its grade separation of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was built in 1936by 1950. MD 192 was extended east from MD 97 along Forest Glen Road to Sligo Creek starting in 1934. That same year, a separate segment was built {{on a part of}} Forest Glen Road then named Fairway Avenue from US 29 west to Dallas Avenue. <b>The</b> <b>Fairway</b> Avenue segment was designated MD 597 by 1939, but became part of MD 192 when the portion of Forest Glen Road between Sligo Creek and Dallas Avenue was brought into the state highway system by 1946. This middle segment between Sligo Creek Parkway and Dallas Avenue was transferred to Montgomery County by 1961. The eastern segment of MD 192, whose eastern end had been shorn off by the construction of US 29's interchange with I-495, was removed from the state highway system in 1977. The final eastern segment of MD 192 from MD 97 to Sligo Creek Parkway was transferred to county maintenance between 1989 and 1991.|$|E

500|$|Strong's {{architectural}} work {{was to be}} commended as praise worthy for its originality. He excelled in making his golf courses stand out with interesting features such as multi-tiered greens and deep, cavernous bunkers. Strong managed to advance his art form {{to a higher level}} not always approached by other architects. Asked to articulate his philosophy of golf course design, Strong said, [...] "the duty of the golf architect is to build natural beauty into every possible feature of play." [...] He believed in the need for good shot-making and felt that a player should pay a high price for a poorly executed shot—occasionally with very dire results. [...] His greens were what set him apart and often set more of the strategy than the equally daunting bunkers. [...] He designed boldly contoured greens that required careful approach, from the ideal side of <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> to avoid running through the green and into trouble beyond. [...] Strong is credited with designing the first island green in the United States. [...] Strong designed this oft-copied challenge—the dreaded 9th hole—in 1928 on the Ocean Course at Ponte Vedra Inn and Club. [...] The course was scheduled to host the 1939 Ryder Cup matches if World War II had not intervened. [...] The island itself, lying 157 yards from the tee, is edged by palm trees and peppered with bunkers; the hole seldom plays easy due to stiff ocean breezes. The Ocean Course was redesigned by Robert Trent Jones Sr. in 1947, then again by Bobby Weed in 1998. The 1947 redesign by Jones was an attempt to reduce some of the severity of Strong's design features.|$|E
