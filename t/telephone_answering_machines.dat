50|$|Tape-based <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> {{had come}} into the {{residential}} telephone market, but they weren't used much in the corporate environment due to physical limitations of the technology.

Further, the manufacturers of PBXs (private branch exchanges—the name for corporate phone systems) used proprietary digital phone sets in order to increase the functionality and value of the PBX.

50|$|The Mini-Cassette, often written minicassette, is a {{magnetic}} tape audio cassette format introduced by Philips in 1967. It is used primarily in dictation machines {{and was also}} employed as a data storage for the Philips P2000 home computer. Unlike the Compact Cassette, also designed by Philips, and the later Microcassette, introduced by Olympus, the Mini-Cassette does not use a capstan drive system; instead, the tape is propelled past the tape head by the reels. This is mechanically simple and allows the cassette to be made smaller and easier to use, but produces a system unsuited to any task other than voice recording, as the tape speed is not constant (averaging 2.4 cm/s) and prone to wow and flutter. However, {{the lack of a}} capstan and a pinch roller drive means that the tape is well-suited to being repeatedly shuttled forward and backward short distances as compared to microcassettes, leading to the Mini-Cassette's use in the first generations of <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines,</b> and continuing use in the niche markets of dictation and transcription, where fidelity is not critical, but robustness of storage is, and where analog media are still widely preferred.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Increased {{incidence}} of <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> {{and the use}} of such devices to screen calls pose a potential threat to the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys. Using data from nine statewide surveys, this analysis examines the ex-tent to which answering machines are used to screen calls and the demographic characteristics associated with answering ma-chine use and call screening. Results show that at most two to three percent of households use answering machines to screen calls, and that such screening is more likely to take place in households with higher family incomes, outside rural areas, and which include individuals who are younger and have higher levels of education. While call screening does not presently threaten the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys, the in-creased {{incidence of}} answering machines together with the in-creased percentage of households indicating these devices ar...|$|E

One of the methods for improving the process is MMSE based Wiener filter. The objective of speech enhancement {{is to improve the}} quality of a speech signal, often degraded by some type of distortion (for example communication channel distortion, additive noise, convolution filtering operation, etc.) The quality of a speech signal is judged, depending on the application, by one or more of the following factors intelligibility, perceptual quality, listener fatigue, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), speech distortion, and (occasionally) recognition accuracy of an automatic speech recognizer. Numerous schemes have been proposed and implemented that perform speech enhancement under various constraints/assumptions and deal with different issues and applications An application of these estimators in an auditory enhancement scheme using the masking threshold of the human auditory system is formulated, resulting in the GMMSE auditory masking threshold (AMT) enhancement method.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether leaving messages on answering machines would aid control recruitment via random-digit telephone dialing, a randomized trial was conducted during 1992 - 1994 involving 1, 323 western Wash-ington households with answering machines. For the experimental group, a message was left informing {{them about the}} study and promising a call-back; for the control group, no message was left. Leaving a message increased the response rate by about 20 percentage points (p = 0. 002). More households were successfully screened for eligible controls, and individuals found eligible {{were more likely to}} participate. Leaving a message can help to improve response rates in telephone surveys. Am J Epidemiol 1996; 144 : 704 - 6. epidemiologic methods; health surveys; telephone Telephone surveys are often used for sampling and for data collection in epidemiologic studies. Achieving high response rates has been complicated by the in-creasing use of <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines,</b> now estimated to be present in over half of US households (1). A telephone interviewer who reaches an answering machine can either hang up or leave a message. If the potential respondent is at home and using the machine to screen out unwanted calls, a message may convince him or her that the call is for worthy research purposes and motivate acceptance of the call. Even if nobody is home, leaving a message may enhance the likelihood of making contact on a follow-up call. However, in-terviewer time is required to listen to the machine's outgoing message and to record the incoming one. Received for publication September 8, 1995, and accepted fo...|$|E

50|$|To {{prevent the}} DSL signal from {{entering}} the phone lines into <b>telephones,</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines,</b> faxes and other devices where it could cause interference, DSL modems come with low pass filters which must be plugged into the phone lines going to all voiceband devices on the same line.

A filter must not be inserted in the phone line going to the DSL modem, because it would block the communication between the modem and switching center.|$|R
