5|$|The hull is {{constructed}} from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter {{and easier to}} weld than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These tiles were developed by the Australian DSTO: as the United States and United Kingdom would not share their information on <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> used on their nuclear submarines, Australian researchers had to develop <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> from scratch. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> were moulded {{in the shape of}} the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat's eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing tiles, as of March 2007, none have been lost from a Collins-class boat.|$|E

5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> have different sizes, so they are not all congruent to each other.|$|E
50|$|Another method {{involves}} soaking <b>the</b> <b>tile,</b> setting <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> then {{allowing it}} to dry, sealing <b>the</b> <b>tile,</b> then grouting. This method prevents the grout from sticking to <b>the</b> <b>tile.</b>|$|R
50|$|Purchase {{building}} tiles - by discarding currency cards of the {{one type}} of combined value {{greater than or equal}} to the value printed on <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> assigned to <b>the</b> currency in <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> market, a player may purchase <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> and either place it in their reserve or in their Granada. A player may also choose to flip <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> over before placing it: if the player chooses to flip <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> and immediately place it in their Granada, a number of currency cards with combined value at least 3 must be discarded; flipping <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> and placing it in the reserve is free. Once placed tiles may not be flipped for the remainder of the game.|$|R
50|$|You {{might ask}} if it's {{possible}} to seal just {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> before setting...the problem is that soaking <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> allows it to bond more strongly with the mortar, and you probably don't want to seal <b>the</b> <b>tile,</b> then soak it in water.|$|R
5|$|Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, {{overlapping}} like <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> on a roof.

5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E
5|$|The color {{matching}} required in a tiling by Wang dominoes {{can easily be}} achieved by modifying the edges of <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> like jigsaw puzzle pieces {{so that they can}} fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings. Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.|$|E
50|$|A player, lacking {{only one}} piece {{to form a}} legal hand (whether {{completing}} a chow, pong, eye or special hand) may steal the discard and wins (this takes precedence over any other players attempt to steal <b>the</b> <b>tile.</b> If two players can use <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> to go mahjong, the player with the most hand-points takes <b>the</b> <b>tile.</b> If their hands are equal, the player closest to the player who discarded <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> wins <b>the</b> hand.|$|R

5|$|A normal tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{for which}} every tile is topologically {{equivalent to a}} disk, the intersection of any two tiles is a single connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius {{can be used for}} all <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.|$|E
5|$|Excavation of {{the site}} began in 1971, and became the largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|In February and March 2011, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism {{sponsored}} {{a test of}} the route by shipping roof tiles to Europe via the Trans-Siberian. <b>The</b> <b>tiles</b> were transported by ship from Hamada, Shimane to Vladivostok, then by the railway to Moscow. The transit time was expected to be 30 days, in comparison with the 50 days on average it takes to ship cargo by ship from Hamada to ports in western Russia. If successful, the ministry would use the results of the test to encourage other Japanese companies to utilize the Trans-Siberian over the sea route.|$|E

40|$|A {{chemical}} treatment reduces the convective and radiative {{contributions to the}} effective thermal conductivity of porous fibrous thermal-insulation <b>tile.</b> <b>The</b> net effect of the treatment is to coat the surfaces of fibers {{with a mixture of}} transition-metal oxides (TMOs) without filling the pores. The TMO coats reduce the cross-sectional areas available for convection while absorbing and scattering thermal radiation in the pores, thereby rendering <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> largely opaque to thermal radiation. The treatment involves a sol-gel process: A solution containing a mixture of transition-metal-oxide-precursor salts plus a gelling agent (e. g., tetraethylorthosilicate) is partially cured, then, before it visibly gels, is used to impregnate <b>the</b> <b>tile.</b> <b>The</b> solution in <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> is gelled, then dried, and then <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> is fired to convert the precursor salts to the desired mixed TMO phases. The amounts of the various TMOs ultimately incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> can be tailored via the concentrations of salts in the solution, and the impregnation depth can be tailored via the viscosity of the solution and/or the volume of the solution relative to that of <b>the</b> <b>tile.</b> <b>The</b> amounts of the TMOs determine the absorption and scattering spectra...|$|R
5|$|It transpired {{that the}} only {{manufacturer}} able to supply suitable tiles was Royal Doulton, although they were {{unable or unwilling to}} replicate DeMorgan's designs, and they were duly commissioned to manufacture the 24 tiles, delivered in May 1908. Mary Watts was unhappy with the design of <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> which were significantly different in colour and appearance from DeMorgan's original tiles, and they were installed without ceremony on 21 August 1908, immediately below DeMorgan's original row of tiles.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings {{are simple}} {{examples}} of aperiodic tilings {{of the plane}}. A tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> normally have {{a finite number of}} shapes, called prototiles, and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles. The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a period of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be non-periodic. A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th or 8th century, damaged by Viking raids and rebuilt and refounded in the 10th century. It owned and managed local land.

Most of the buildings were demolished and the stone used in local buildings, although the Abbot's House and reredorter survive. Some of <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> and other decorative features from the monastic church were reused in the adjacent parish Church of St Peter and St Paul. Since 1927 the ruins have been in public ownership.|$|E

5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish sides of <b>the</b> <b>tiles,</b> and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways {{but not in}} others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right.

In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|The player acts as {{pilot for}} a cargo ship, {{performing}} space runs for various corporations. The ship is a flat platform {{made up of}} hexagonal tiles. The player places weapons and modules on <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> in order to defend the ship from enemies and hazards. Different structures have varying placement requirements, or may require more than one tile to be placed. For example, most weapons must be placed facing outward into empty space, while some require power to be supplied by an adjacent power source.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} using the 256 {{graphics}} tiles on the NES was handled with special programming techniques. The team streamlined the process by dividing the number of tiles into two groups of 128 and separating them into enemy characters and protagonists.

40|$|We present <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> style, an {{architectural}} style {{that allows the}} creation of distributed software systems for solving NP-complete problems on large public networks. <b>The</b> <b>tile</b> style preserves <b>the</b> privacy of the algorithm and data, tolerates faulty and malicious nodes, and scales well to leverage {{the size of the}} public network to accelerate the computation. We exploit the known property of NP-complete problems to transform important real-world problems, such as protein folding, image recognition, and resource allocation, into canonical problems, such as 3 -SAT, that <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> style solves. We provide a full formal analysis of <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> style that indicates the style preserves data privacy as long as no adversary controls {{more than half of the}} public network. We also present an empirical evaluation showing that problems requiring privacy-preservation can be solved on a very large network using <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> style orders of magnitude faster than using existing alternatives. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study {{self-assembly}} systems, in particular, {{we focus on}} <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> complexity of shapes. Using <b>the</b> standard <b>tile</b> assembly model proposed by Rothemund and Winfree, we give two lower bounds on <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> complexity of arbitrary shapes {{in terms of the}} radius and diameter of the shape. Applying our results to a square yields a partial answer to a problem of Rothemund and Winfree. We also introduce a new model of self assembly—the step assembly model—which can significantly reduce <b>the</b> number of <b>tile</b> types needed to assemble a given shape. For this model, we give an upper bound on <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> complexity of arbitrary shapes and exhibit a family of shapes with constant tile complexity. Furthermore, we relate <b>the</b> <b>tile</b> complexity of a shape in the step assembly model to the well known node search number of its underlying spanning tree...|$|R

5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for <b>the</b> <b>tiles</b> of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E
