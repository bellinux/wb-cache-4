5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E

500|$|Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{stated that}} [...] "Daddy" [...] was {{probably}} written {{specifically for the}} soundtrack album of Daddy's Little Girls and that it may even [...] "play a part in a pivotal scene." [...] Making reference to Beyoncé long-time relationship with Jay-Z and then recent rumors about them possibly getting married, Nero added that the song might leave several numerous fans wondering what could happen next. Marc Anthony Neal of the international webzine PopMatters considered [...] "Daddy" [...] to be the [...] "most affecting song on Dangerously in Love." [...] He went on writing that the song is an extraordinary tribute to her father Mathew Knowles, stating that Beyoncé [...] "embraces [...] the man <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> take the kind of artistic leap that Dangerously in Love represents." [...] He ended up by adding that [...] "By the time listeners get to the fifteenth and final track, they will have been so pleasantly surprised and impressed by Beyoncé's performance throughout, that 'Daddy' seems less corny" [...] {{but it is in}} this song that she finally accepts the state of being a woman, rather than a girl. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine described the song as an ode dedicated to the man that [...] "instilled perseverance".|$|E
500|$|The show {{features}} classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns, {{in combination}} with atypical elements. Much of the series {{is devoted to the}} science fiction plot surrounding the Orb, and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> Brisco maintain its cult status. In almost every episode, the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology. In the pilot episode, Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks. In the episode [...] "Brisco For the Defense", Brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence. Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology, including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium-filled zeppelin. Campbell told Starlog magazine, [...] "It's kind of Jules Verne meets The Wild Wild West." [...] The presence of futuristic technology in a Victorian era Western places the series in the steampunk genre; {{it is one of the}} few such shows to have aired on prime-time television. At least one-third of the show's episodes contain steampunk or Weird West elements. Though [...] "technology-out-of-time" [...] frequently intrudes into the plots of Brisco, the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again. Some of these out-of-time technologies were archaic imaginations of those prevalent in the 20th century, and two film researchers, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions, so useful in their own lives, are not exploited further.|$|E

500|$|At {{the onset}} of the fandom, Hasbro was {{generally}} tolerant of uploads of content and derivative works on sites such as YouTube. However, in late 2011, a fan-run website called [...] "Ponyarchive" [...] that was reposting for no cost the complete high-definition episodes that were being sold on iTunes closed down after receiving cease and desist letters from Hasbro. The otherwise [...] "hands-off" [...] policy has enabled the growth of the fandom. In another case, Hasbro was required to take legal action to protect the My Little Pony trademark against a group working on a massively multiplayer online game, MLP: Online, though the developers, after working with Hasbro's legal team, are seeking to develop a new Friendship Is Magic-related game without the trademark issues. Though many fan-created videos combine copyright footage of Friendship Is Magic with adult elements from films inappropriate for children like Inglourious Basterds or foul language from musical artists such as Wu-Tang Clan, Hasbro has not taken a stance against these videos and has recognized that the parodies and remixes form a culture of participation <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> to draw larger attention to the show. In light of the Stop Online Piracy Act, Daniel Nye Griffiths of Forbes considered the fans' re-use of copyrighted works and creation of new works from them as examples of the inevitable result of any media gaining a fandom, and praised Hasbro for embracing the means to extend the brand through this instead of trying endlessly to stop such infringements. More recently, Hasbro has taken a more proactive stance, including issuing cease and desist letters to more visible projects such as [...] and MLP Online, and selling episodes on YouTube, which in turn has caused some fan videos to run afoul of YouTube's Content ID system.|$|E

2500|$|Through these {{courts and}} system of {{patronage}} emerged the epic style of poetry, with Ferdowsi's Shahnama at the apex.

2500|$|The name can {{be based}} on many {{different}} factors. For instance, {{it is common for}} new chapters to take on an element from an existent chapter <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> them form. Theta Xi in Toronto adopted the Xi from their neighbor chapter in Michigan, and in turn chapters in Ontario started adding [...] "Theta" [...] as part of their name from their relationship to the Toronto chapter. There are now many chapters in Ontario and there is no pre-requisite to have a Theta in the name. Other times, a name is related to other factors like the Roman Catholic Villanova University chapter being named Alpha Omega due to the Christian significance.|$|E

2500|$|Sport {{is a very}} {{important}} part of Tamworth culture, and over 50 different sports and recreational pursuits are participated in by the community. Many major annual and one-off sporting events are held in the city because of the wide range of facilities and venues available. There are over 180 sporting clubs in the Tamworth region and the region has several strong competitions, including basketball, cricket, football (soccer), hockey, netball, rugby league, rugby union and Aussie rules football. As a result, the city has produced many sportspeople, including test cricketers, olympic shooters and hockey players, and many players in the National Rugby League. The Northern Inland Academy of Sport is one important institution in the city <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> talented sportspeople to establish themselves [...] "on and off the field". It was established in 1992 and has a wide range of community support.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{political}} scientists maintained that setting economic interdependence {{as a foreign}} policy goal may have exposed the United States to manipulation. As a result, the U.S. trading partners gained an ability to influence the U.S. foreign policy decision-making process by manipulating, for example, the currency exchange rate, or restricting the flow of goods and raw materials. In addition, more than 40% of the U.S. foreign debt is currently owned by the big institutional investors from overseas, who continue to accumulate the Treasury bonds. A Washington Post reporter wrote that [...] "several less-than-democratic African leaders have skillfully played the anti-terrorism card to earn {{a relationship with the}} United States <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> keep them in power", and suggested, in effect, that therefore foreign dictators could manipulate U.S. foreign policy for their own benefit.

[...] Parry Gettelman of the Orlando Sentinel rated the album two stars and found the band's attempt to merge rock music with dance rhythms underwhelming, saying, [...] "U2 lacks the zest for {{experimentation}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>helped</b> make electronic music so appealing to music fans weary of formulaic rock". John Sakamoto of Jam! Showbiz said, [...] "Far from an exercise in daring self-indulgence, Pop is too often guilty of a much more serious offence: not going far enough." [...] He added, [...] "as with so many elements of the ephemeral culture it both disparages and celebrates, it ends up being something considerably less than has been advertised." ...|$|E
