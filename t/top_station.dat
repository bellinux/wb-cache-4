500|$|The {{final phase}} of {{principal}} photography took place in Alberta in late November2009. The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort, Fortress Mountain. An elaborate set was assembled near the <b>top</b> <b>station</b> of the Canadian chairlift, taking three months to build. The production {{had to wait for}} a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived. The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan's favorite James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969): [...] "What I liked about it that we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{locomotive}} {{works at}} Darlington operated independently under Bouch until 1875, the locomotives having been renumbered by the NER {{a couple of}} years earlier. There was a varied range of locomotives, but the most common type was used on the mineral trains and had a wheel arrangement of 0-6-0; the later engines were of the Stephenson long boilered type. Most passenger locomotives had four driven wheels in the form 2-4-0; some were 2-2-2. Bouch had designed two bogie 4-4-0 locomotives for the line over Stainmore in 1860, and another fourteen with this wheel arrangement had been built by 1874. S services and those on the ECML called at different stations in Darlington until 1887, when S trains were diverted through a rebuilt Darlington Bank <b>Top</b> <b>station,</b> rejoining the route to Stockton from a junction south of Darlington and a new line to Oak Tree Junction. An extension from Stanhope to [...] opened in 1895, and the line over Stainmore to Tebay was doubled {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E

2500|$|As the Mission 66 Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg {{with a new}} {{battlefield}} {{observation deck}} was being completed in 1962, the nearby 1896 Zeigler's Grove observation tower was removed (the 1895 Big Round Top observation tower was removed in 1968). [...] In 1967, the NPS purchased the 1921 Gettysburg National Museum, which the NPS operated from 1971-2008.

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{tourists}} to the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield typically arrived at the borough by train and paid fees for horse-drawn jitney taxis to travel over the battlefield on primitive wagon roads of the private Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association.

[...] Similarly, the original battlefield roads had fallen into disrepair after the GBMA funds had become nearly exhausted by late 1882. [...] Despite the preceding 1884 Round Top Branch steamtrain railroad that operated across the field of Pickett's Charge and Hancock Avenue to Round <b>Top</b> <b>Station,</b> an 1892 meeting next-door at the Round Top School formed an opposition committee of Cumberland Township voters (William H.

5000|$|Kundala Valley Railway {{was built}} in 1902 and {{operated}} between Munnar and <b>Top</b> <b>Station</b> in the Kannan Devan Hills of Kerala [...] This railway was built to transport tea and other goods. Initially a cart road was cut in 1902, then later replaced by a monorail goods carriage system along the road leading from Munnar to <b>Top</b> <b>Station</b> {{for the purpose of}} transporting tea and other products from Munnar and Madupatty to <b>Top</b> <b>Station.</b> This monorail was based on the Ewing System and had a small wheel placed on the track while a larger wheel rested on the road to balance the monorail. This was similar to the Patiala State Monorail Trainways. The monorail was pulled by bullocks. <b>Top</b> <b>Station</b> was a transshipment point for delivery of tea from Munnar to Bodinayakkanur. Tea chests arriving at <b>Top</b> <b>Station</b> were then transported by an aerial ropeway from <b>Top</b> <b>Station</b> 5 km down hill to the south to Kottagudi, Tamil Nadu, which popularly became known as [...] "Bottom Station".
