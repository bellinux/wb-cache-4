25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderle later {{stated that}} the line [...] "was taken {{slightly}} out of context" [...] and that Love was {{more concerned with the}} [...] "bottom line" [...] than the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business. [...] Asher did not recall hearing the remark and could not verify whether it was actually spoken. He said that, [...] "it seems very much like Mike. And to tell the truth, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> point," [...] arguing that Pet Sounds [...] "was not much of a success" [...] and that its music [...] "was [...] not what Beach Boys fans were expecting." [...] Parks believes that Love's hostility toward Wilson and Smile was [...] "the deciding factor" [...] in the album's cancellation. In a 1998 deposition related to the memoir , Wilson testified that Love had never spoken the line to him, and when asked if Love's opposition to the lyrics made him shelve the album, he responded: [...] "No. There weren't as many lyrics as there was just—see, Smile wasn't a lyrical thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a child Baggott had {{the normal}} curiosity of {{wondering}} {{how the world}} worked. He {{was very interested in}} [...] "how stuff came to be". Baggott told science writer Brian Clegg that the reason why he went into the sciences was because he had some great schoolteachers. He loved physics but did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong enough talent for the mathematics that would be required. [...] "That said, my desire to seek explanations for things led me to chemical physics and it was with a great sense of pride and pleasure that I did manage to publish some entirely theoretical research papers, full of mathematical equations!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrison Ford {{considers}} Deckard to be human. [...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. [...] "I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> little reservation about that. I think {{he really wanted to}} have it both ways." [...] Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).|$|E
2500|$|Jack Limpert {{published}} {{evidence as}} early as 1974 that Felt was the informant. On June 25 of that year, {{a few weeks after}} All the President's Men was published, The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial, [...] "If You Drink Scotch, Smoke, Read, Maybe You're Deep Throat." [...] It began [...] "W. Mark Felt says he isn't now, nor has he ever been Deep Throat." [...] The Journal quoted Felt saying the character was a [...] "composite" [...] and [...] "I'm just not that kind of person." [...] In 1975, George V. Higgins wrote: [...] "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Washington Post alias borrowed from a dirty movie." [...] During a grand jury investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify and the prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights J. Stanley Pottinger, discovered that Felt was [...] "Deep Throat", but the secrecy of the proceedings preserved the secrecy of Felt's alter ego from the public.|$|E

2500|$|When Chandler came to {{work with}} Wilder he was already a {{recovering}} alcoholic. As Wilder noted, [...] "He was in Alcoholics Anonymous, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tough time with me – I drove him back into drinking..." [...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, {{to mention that the}} studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next project, the Best Picture-winning The Lost Weekend, about an alcoholic writer. Wilder made the film, in part, [...] "to explain Chandler to himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone in 1995, Jagger stated that Taylor never {{explained}} {{why he had}} left, and surmised that [...] " [...] {{wanted to have a}} solo career. I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith." [...] In the same interview Jagger said of Taylor's contribution to the band: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> big contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don't have now. Neither Keith nor Ronnie Wood plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave me something to follow, to bang off. Some people think that's the best version of the band that existed". Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Jagger said: [...] "I obviously can't say if I think Mick Taylor was the best, because it sort of trashes the period the band is in now." [...] Charlie Watts stated: [...] "I think we chose the right man for the job at that time just as Ronnie was the right man for the job later on. I still think Mick is great. I haven't heard or seen him play in a few years. But certainly what came out of playing with him are musically some of the best things we've ever done". Another statement in Guitar World in October 2002 made by Richards said [...] "Mick Taylor and I worked really well together ... He had some lovely energy. Sweetly sophisticated playing, way beyond his years. Lovely sense of melody. I never understood why he left the Stones, Nor does he, I think ... I had no desire to see him go." [...] Taylor later admitted in the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane that he had become addicted to heroin and hoped to protect his family from the drug culture surrounding the band by leaving.|$|E
