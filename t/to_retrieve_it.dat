5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a killer whale carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} a shark. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach. He wades over <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it</b> and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it</b> on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for crews' wages {{to be stopped}} when a ship was sunk. Famed Labour leader James Larkin {{raised the issue of}} the survivors' treatment in the Dáil Éireann. Citing the crew member who was told by the Labour exchange to 'go and get his record card', which was lost when Irish Oak sank, he suggested that the Dáil Éireann ask the German Consul-General to send a submarine <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The tip-of-the-tongue {{state is}} the {{phenomenon}} that occurs when people fail to recall information but still {{feel as if they}} are close <b>to</b> <b>retrieving</b> <b>it</b> from memory. In this sense an individual feels as if they [...] "know" [...] but cannot [...] "remember" [...] the actual information desired. It is a frustrating but common problem that typically occurs for individuals about once a week, is frequent among nouns and is typically resolved on its own. The occurrence of the tip-of-the-tongue state increases with age throughout adulthood. Such a feeling is indication that remembering will occur or is about to occur.|$|R

5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it</b> using a space shuttle. Hubble {{would then have}} most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E
5|$|Ralph was {{not chosen}} {{archbishop}} of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone. His election involved an {{assembly of the}} lords and bishops meeting with King Henry I of England. Ralph then received his pallium from Pope Paschal II, rather than travelling to Rome <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it.</b> As archbishop, Ralph was very assertive {{of the rights of}} the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland. Ralph also quarrelled for a time with Pope Paschal II.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when he bent under the table <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it</b> noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|SERN, an {{organization}} secretly researching time travel, learns {{of the time}} machine and sends people to the laboratory <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it,</b> killing Mayuri in the process.

He learns {{that he needs to}} undo all the changes their D-mails have caused, and does so until he realizes that undoing the first D-mail would return him to the timeline where Kurisu was found dead. Okabe and Kurisu tell each other about their romantic feelings for one another, after which Kurisu tells Okabe to save Mayuri. Daru hacks into SERN's database, and they delete the record of the D-mail, returning them to the original timeline.|$|E

The Doctor and Donna go to Caecilius's house <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it.</b> Unknown to them, they have been followed by a soothsayer who reports to the Sibylline Sisterhood that the prophesised man in the blue box has arrived, and the Sisters fear the prediction that his arrival brings fire and death.|$|E

Jessie {{explains}} that the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage. When Woody's arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it</b> and escape, but is foiled when Al's television set turns on, and blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her. The next morning, Woody's arm is fixed by a toy repair specialist, and Woody learns that Jessie once belonged to a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. Woody decides to stay, now believing that all toys will eventually get discarded by their owners.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it.</b> I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|However, SERN learns of {{the time}} machine and sends a group <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>it,</b> killing Mayuri in the process. Using Kurisu's time leap machine, Rintarō travels back in time {{numerous}} times {{to try to save}} Mayuri, but to no avail. As Rintarō reaches wit's end, he is approached by Suzuha Amane, a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine, who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta world line in which Mayuri won't die. By undoing the effects of the D-Mails that caused shifts in the time line, Rintarō regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier, allowing them to crack into SERN's systems and delete the evidence of Rintarō's original D-Mail. However, Rintarō realizes that by doing so, he would have to return to a world line in which Kurisu is dead. After realizing their feelings for each other, Kurisu tells Rintarō to save Mayuri. Reluctantly, Rintarō agrees and deletes the evidence of his D-Mail from SERN's database, returning him to the Beta world line.|$|E

50|$|Function {{pointers}} are obfuscated by XOR-ing with {{a random}} number, {{so that the}} actual address pointed to is hard <b>to</b> <b>retrieve.</b> So would be to manually change a pointer, as the obfuscation key used for the pointer {{would be very hard}} <b>to</b> <b>retrieve.</b> Thus, <b>it</b> is made hard for any unauthorized user of the function pointer to be able to actually use it. Also metadata for heap blocks are XOR-ed with random numbers. In addition, check-sums for heap blocks are maintained, which is used to detect unauthorized changes and heap corruption. Whenever a heap corruption is detected, the application is killed to prevent successful completion of the exploit.|$|R
