5|$|SEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer {{has agreed}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have three {{different}} licenses; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes {{and other kinds}} of security issues, another which is an ordinary driver's license, and then a special card that identifies the people who would be on the road.|$|E
25|$|What we have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reform, to civilize our masquerades, {{because we}} ought not to let these days of popular {{diversion}} disappear from among us, in a country that has suffered so much.|$|E
25|$|Gaston {{does not}} appear in QRN sur Bretzelburg (published in 1961-63), but in one scene Fantasio is about to endure painful agony by torturers in a totalitarian state. He thus decides that the best thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> focus on {{emptiness}} and think of Gaston.|$|E
50|$|All that <b>was</b> left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} Emperor.|$|R
50|$|Elsie {{decided that}} the best thing for them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> kill John and run away. Elsie conspired with a {{reluctant}} Jesse to poison John’s tea with arsenic so they could elope, but their attempt failed.|$|R
25|$|After {{hearing about}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, he decided the right thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{volunteer}} for the U.S. Army. In January 1942, he joined the Army as a private soldier and <b>was</b> assigned <b>to</b> the European Theatre of Operations.|$|R
25|$|The {{first thing}} a fast bowler needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed {{is to hold}} the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close {{together}} {{at the top of}} the seam with the thumb gripping the ball at the bottom of the seam. The image to the right shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls – see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{see that}} he [...] is clever and {{handsome}} and I, an old man, wish to have him as my adopted son... He need change neither his name nor his surname. I only want him to call me father temporarily so that I can faithfully transmit all the skills I have learned {{in my life to}} a single person. Later, when I die, all he has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> bury my old bones in the earth and not allow them to be exposed, and that is all".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the 1939 New York World's Fair {{itself and}} its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: [...] "...obviously the title refers to the World Expo {{and the spirit of}} that was looking at the future with a sense of {{optimism}} and a sense of the whimsical, you know, something that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're more cynical, more practical, ... I think what this film attempts <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edward Daffam of the Grenfell Action Group said, “They didn’t give a {{stuff about}} us. We were the carcass {{and they were}} the vultures. North Kensington was like a goldmine, only they didn’t have to dig for the gold. All they had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> marginalise the people who were living here, and that’s what they were doing.” ...|$|R
50|$|A settlor can declare him/herself {{trustee of}} his/her own {{property}}. The settlor already holds {{title to the}} property and all that needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make a valid declaration. However, a declaration of trust {{will not be allowed}} out of an invalid gift.|$|R
25|$|Taylor {{believed}} in transferring control from workers to management. He {{set out to}} increase the distinction between mental (planning work) and manual labor (executing work). Detailed plans, specifying the job and how it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> formulated by management and communicated to the workers.|$|R
500|$|When he {{is about}} 30, Widmerpool becomes engaged to a {{considerably}} older widow, Mildred Haycock. His main motivation appears to be his craving for social status; she {{is the daughter of}} Lord Vowchurch. In his analysis of Powell's works, Nicholas Birns wrote: [...] "What Widmerpool wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> 'marry up', to make a marriage that will cement his upward social mobility, and he is willing to take an older woman with two teenage children in order to accomplish this." [...] The engagement ends abruptly, over Widmerpool's impotence during an attempted premarital sexual union.|$|E
500|$|With {{effect from}} 3 March 2009, the {{residence}} requirement for overseas voters {{was reduced to}} an aggregate of 30 days during the three years immediately before the prescribed date, and the special dispensation of the requirement applying to citizens working or studying abroad at the Government's direction and their families was removed. The change was described in Parliament as a measure to [...] "allow more overseas Singaporeans to vote. All an overseas Singaporean needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> come home for 10 days a year to visit his family and friends." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> study her employer. After I {{went to work for}} Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|E
2500|$|Peru contested this view, {{stating that}} such {{discrepancies}} {{had already been}} solved in an arbitration {{that had taken place}} in 1945, and that all that had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> close the border following the guidelines of the Protocol and the ruling of the 1945 arbitration ...|$|R
50|$|According to Jan Smuts, {{the railway}} {{between the two}} towns was still intact, but since there were women and {{children}} in O'okiep town, all the commando <b>was</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> give O'okiep a tremendous fright with a harmless explosion. Boer General Ben Bouwer had inspected the trainload before it was sent hurtling into the besieged town, {{to make sure that there}} were no caps in the dynamite.|$|R

500|$|During his lifetime, Agagianian was {{considered}} the Catholic Church's leading expert on communism and the Soviet Union. Norman St John-Stevas wrote 1955 that Agagianian is [...] "uncommitted" [...] in the Cold War. In a January 1958 diplomatic report Marcus Cheke, UK Ambassador to the Holy See, wrote that Agagianian [...] "believes {{that the best thing}} for the Western powers <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> hang on, avoid war (and the more strongly armed and united they are, the less danger there is of Russia venturing on a war) and to wait for a transformation inside Russia, which he thinks will happen sooner or later." [...] In contrast, Agagianian called for a [...] "heroically Christian" [...] struggle against communism during his visit to Australia in 1959.|$|E
500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Marvel held a {{press event}} to {{announce}} the titles of their Phase Three films. The event, which drew comparisons to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, was done because all the information was ready. As Feige explained, [...] "We {{wanted to do this}} at [...] Comic-Con this year. Things were not set ... So the plan has been, since a few weeks before Comic-Con when we realized we weren't {{going to be able to}} do everything we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> decide 'let's do either something we haven't done in a long time, or something we've never done.' Which is a singular event, just to announce what we have when it's ready. I thought that might be early August, or mid-September, it ended up being [...]" ...|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the Times Higher Education, Andrew May, the Director of Estates, Hospitality and Contract Services at the University of Hertfordshire has asserted that what the University aims <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use the estates strategy as the delivery vehicle for driving corporate and cultural change. In 1992, it established University of Hertfordshire Press, whose first publication was a book celebrating the institution's change in status from polytechnic to university.|$|R
30|$|Pure::variants creates {{software}} product line {{artifacts from the}} source-code of a base application. Therefore, while using this tool, {{the first thing the}} subjects had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> implement this base application. Then, in DE they should generate the feature and the architectural models of the domain and define its variant environment. Finally, in AE the subjects should select the domain featured according to the application requirements and generate this application source-code.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} way {{to increase}} the retention rate - {{the percentage of students}} who return to study after the first year - <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase admission standards. Similarly, to increase the six-year graduation rates - the national effectiveness measure for students completing baccalaureate degrees - increase admission standards. The most heartless thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> accept students who are not ready. The most wasteful thing a university can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> take on students who will be unsuccessful in completing their studies. Lost opportunity costs accrue to both student and institution...|$|R
500|$|Others {{have noted}} {{that the lack of}} {{coverage}} is not simply a media issue. Peter Fahy, the spokesman on race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: [...] "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the best thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> try and avoid [...] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage. Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating [...] "there was {{no reason to believe that}} the attack was racially motivated".|$|E
500|$|On the game's community, Adams said, [...] "They are {{the reason}} I've {{been able to make}} the step from {{hobbyist}} to full-time developer. I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things." [...] On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, Adams said, [...] "It's really gratifying, because it's {{one of the things we}} set out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get people to write these narratives about their game." [...] Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves.|$|E
500|$|At dinner, Peter {{breaks the}} news to his children, but decides {{to keep it from}} Lois. He tries {{different}} jobs, such as cereal mascot and sneeze guard, but fails miserably. Brian pressures him to tell her the truth, but all he manages <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> tell Lois how fat she is. Brian insists that Peter must look out for his family's welfare. With the word [...] "welfare" [...] in his mind, Peter soon applies for a government assistance at a welfare office. But a processing error creates a weekly check for $150,000. Telling Lois he received a big raise, Peter spends his money on many foolish and extravagant things, such as renting the Statue of David, treating Meg to cosmetic surgery and even {{going so far as to}} surround his house with a moat to protect them from the Black Knight.|$|E
25|$|Poe is not {{in favor}} of divorce, stating that the first thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> first <b>is</b> <b>to</b> amend the Family Code of the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|A {{better way}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> refactor the {{business}} logic (in this example storing the filename to the registry) {{into a separate}} class.|$|R
50|$|Gesell's {{theory was}} that the trouble with the world was that people saved money so that what you had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make them spend it faster. Disappearing money is the {{heaviest}} form of continuous taxation ever devised. The theory behind this idea of Gesell's was that what <b>is</b> required <b>is</b> <b>to</b> stimulate trade - {{that you have to}} get people frantically buying goods - a perfectly sound idea so long as the objective of life is merely trading.|$|R
500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
500|$|The labourers {{worked in}} 12-hour shifts of 3,000–4,000 men, with three 20-minute breaks during each shift. The work {{continued}} around the clock, {{seven days a}} week, under giant floodlights during the night. The living and working conditions were extremely harsh, especially for the political prisoners and the eastern Europeans, who were given especially punitive treatment due to their status as the most expendable members of the workforce. For the non-German workers, falling ill or being unable to work through injury {{was the equivalent of}} a death sentence, as they would either be left to die or be transported back to the concentration camps from which they had been brought. A German commission that inspected the labour camps in the area in late 1943 commented: [...] "The Eastern [...] worker is very tough. He works at his job until he falls flat on his face in the mire, and all that is left for the doctor <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> issue the death certificate." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E
50|$|First off, {{the three}} players had a closest-to-the-hole contest {{in which they}} hit two shots from a {{location}} and the player who has the closest total distance to the hole wins and is safe from elimination. Players who miss the green were disqualified and headed into elimination. Both Annie and Kelly missed the green on their first shot, so all Mallory needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> hit the green on both shots to save herself from being eliminated, which she did.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{implementation}} of the four pillars of education; learning <b>to</b> know, <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and <b>to</b> live together (Directorate General Higher Education(DIKTI) : 2008, cited from UNESCO: 1996) has apparently been a rhetoric in higher education. Classes are still taught in traditional way. Competence-based curriculum seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> neglected {{when it comes to}} teaching method. Thus, this study <b>is</b> aimed <b>to</b> promote cooperative learning as a teaching method in EFL (English for Foreign Language) classroom in higher education to transform the four pillars of education. This two-cycle-classroom action research <b>is</b> employed <b>to</b> answer the research question; how can cooperative learning realize the four pillars of education in EFL classrooms?. Observation on the teaching and learning process <b>is</b> employed <b>to</b> know the effectiveness of the method and questionnaire <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> know the students’ opinions on the method. Results show that cooperative learning enables students <b>to</b> know, <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and <b>to</b> live together and students perceive the method in positive ways. Thus, cooperative learning is recommended as an alternative teaching method to promote the four pillars of education in EFL classrooms in higher education.

The winger took off on a {{spectacular}} diagonal run towards the Welsh goal. His speed and unexpected direction created a massive overlap. The Welsh suddenly looked {{as though they had}} only ten players in action and all Australia had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> transfer the ball carefully. They <b>did</b> so. Campese <b>to</b> Poidevin and then on to Lynagh, who scored between the posts." ...|$|R
