We examine the difference scores of Self Description form between two conditions. In the first condition we instruct subject {{to complete the}} form honestly (honest condition). On the other hand, in the second condition we instruct subject complete the form to make they look as good as possible (faking condition). Result suggest that in the item attributes that susceptible <b>to</b> <b>faking,</b> the score on the faking condition was higher than honest condition because subject were enable to improve their scores.

5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals <b>to</b> <b>fake</b> a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E

Filming took place from June 4 to June 20 with the final scenes being shot in Los Angeles, California. By July 13, principal shooting of the film had been completed and post-production had begun.|$|E

Shuu then recalls that Nageki's only relative—his adoptive brother—was, like Kazuaki, a quail. The {{terrorist}} incident occurred at Kazuaki and Nageki's orphanage and left them as the only survivors; witnessing Nageki's subsequent suicide drove Kazuaki insane, leading him <b>to</b> <b>fake</b> his own death, assume a new identity, and join the school's faculty to take revenge against Shuu, the head of Operation Hatoful.

The decision not to renew Badland's contract was announced on 18 September 2016, with Babe scheduled to depart from the series in 2017, three years after her debut. Badland made her final appearance in episode 5438, originally broadcast in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2017.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy <b>to</b> <b>fake,</b> such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E
5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>fake.</b> Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, {{they were able to}} replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E
40|$|Self-report {{measures}} {{are known to}} be susceptible <b>to</b> <b>faking,</b> and response distortion is a particularly critical issue in the context of assessing job applicants (Holden & Kroner, 1992; Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, & McCloy, 1990). However, the advent of conditional reasoning methodology makes it possible to assess personality more objectively by focusing on implicit rather than explicit cognitions. Previous research has suggested that the conditional reasoning methodology is resistant <b>to</b> <b>faking.</b> This study evaluates the fakability of a new measure of addiction, the Conditional Reasoning Test of Addiction Proneness, which was developed specifically to assess the implicit cognitions that justify engaging in addictive behavior (Bowler, Bowler, & James, 2011). This study examined whether respondents could successfully distort their responses on the Conditional Reasoning Test for Addiction Proneness as well as a self-report measure of addiction, the Self-Assessment of Behavior. Results indicate that the self-report measure is susceptible <b>to</b> <b>faking</b> but the conditional reasoning measure is resistant to response distortion, thus providing further support that Conditional Reasoning Test of Addiction Proneness does in fact assess implicit cognitions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of measures of automatic cognition {{is supposed to be}} that they are less susceptible <b>to</b> <b>faking</b> than explicit tests. It is an empirical question, however, to what degree these measures can be faked, and the response might well differ for different measures. We tested whether the Implicit Association Test (IAT, Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) cannot be faked as easily as explicit measures of the same constructs. We chose the Big-Five dimensions conscientiousness and extraversion as the constructs of interest. The results show, indeed, that the IAT is much less susceptible <b>to</b> <b>faking</b> than questionnaire measures are, even if no selective faking of single dimensions of the questionnaire occurred. However, given limited experience, scores on the IAT, too, are susceptible <b>to</b> <b>faking.</b> Key words: implicit cognition, automatic cognitive processes, faking, Implicit Association Test, Big Five “Physicians would not ask their patients to estimate their own white blood cell count ” (McCrae & Costa, 1999, p. 141).

5|$|Lucan's {{disappearance}} has captivated the public's imagination for decades, {{with thousands}} of sightings reported across the world. One of the earliest, shortly after the murder, {{turned out to be}} a British ex-politician, John Stonehouse, who had attempted <b>to</b> <b>fake</b> his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia {{turned out to be a}}n American businessman. John Miller, a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs, claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl, but was later exposed by the News of the World as a hoaxer. In 2003 a former Scotland Yard detective thought he had tracked the earl to Goa, India; the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from StHelens. In 2007, reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wesley Rackstraw is {{a retired}} pilot and ex-convict who served on an army {{helicopter}} crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosive possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted <b>to</b> <b>fake</b> his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot licenses; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.|$|E

Overseen by Tony Bramwell of NEMS Enterprises, the event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised. Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the avant garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses <b>to</b> <b>fake</b> stick-on nipples. Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.|$|E

5|$|During 1944, the {{division}} aided Operation Overlord {{in a number}} of formats. On 9 April, the 183rd Infantry Brigade ceased to exist as a formation and formed HQ Residue Concentration Area to aid the invasion preparation. The 4th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment and the 10th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment were attached to 21st Army Group to aid 185th Camouflage Field Company, Royal Engineers. The men of the 4th Northamptonshire Regiment created 150 fake Landing Craft Tanks (LCTs), made from steel tubing and canvas, and positioned them along the River Deben at Ipswich, as well as at Oulton Broad, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. The 10th Worcestershire Regiment constructed fake landing craft at Dover, Folkestone, and Harwich, in addition <b>to</b> <b>fake</b> LCTs on the River Orwell. By 6 June, the battalion had constructed 122 such dummy displays.

Here, in addition to 45th Infantry Division and Royal Marines, it allegedly took part in the build-up of the notional First United States Army Group (FUSAG). The division was then made part of the fictional British VII Corps, part of the equally fake Fourth Army, and 'travelled' to Scotland before returning south to FUSAG.
