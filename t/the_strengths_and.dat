40|$|This study {{attempts}} to examine <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> durability of concrete using low quality coarse aggregates from the circum-Pacific region. The research {{starts with the}} examination of <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> durability of low quality coarse aggregates from the circum-Pacific region, and subsequently examine for {{the influence of the}} low quality coarse aggregate on the concrete characteristics. Lastly, the quality improvement methods: the coating of coarse aggregate and combined with the normal aggregate methods, for concrete using the low quality coarse aggregates are proposed.

5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> weaknesses certain weapons and types of magic have {{against each other in}} a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{comprehensive}} {{series of}} drained triaxial compression tests {{were performed on}} crushed concrete aggregate (CCA) moist as compacted. When compared to ordinary natural well-graded gravelly soils, <b>the</b> peak <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness increase more significantly with dry density, while {{the effect of the}} degree of saturation during compaction is much less significant. In a range of confining pressure of 30 – 600 kPa, <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness of well-compacted CCA is similar to, or, in some cases even higher than, typical selected high-class backfill materials (e. g., well-graded gravelly soil of crushed quarry hard rock). <b>The</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness of CCA with a maximum particle size Dmax= 37. 5 mm obtained from a typical concrete crushing plant are noticeably lower than CCA sieved to Dmax= 19 mm compacted using the same energy. However, when compacted to the same dry density, the original CCA exhibits <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness higher than the sieved CCA. Effects of <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of original concrete on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness of compacted CCA are insignificant, while <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness of compacted CCA are, respectively, noticeably higher than, or similar to, the original concrete aggregate (i. e., natural gravelly soil) compacted using the same energy. All these results indicate that well-compacted CCA can be used as the backfill material for important civil engineering soil structures requiring a high stability while allowing a limited amount of deformation...|$|R

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Strategically, as {{a result}} of the {{fighting}} around Milne Bay, Japanese operations within the region were constrained. The defeat at Milne Bay kept them from bypassing the holding action that the Australians were conducting on the Kokoda Track. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. The Japanese commanders were then forced to change their plans in the region, shifting their focus towards repelling the US forces that had landed on Guadalcanal, while maintaining a smaller effort around Buna–Gona, under Major General Tomitarō Horii. Once they had retaken Guadalcanal, they planned to reinforce Horii's forces and launch a reinvigorated attack on the Australians around Port Moresby. In the end, subsequent defeats at Buna–Gona and on Guadalcanal did not allow them to implement these plans, as the Allies gained the ascendency in the region throughout late 1942 and the Japanese were forced to fall back to the northern coast of New Guinea. In the aftermath of the battle, a large amount of intelligence was also gained by the Allies, providing their planners with a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> weaknesses of the Japanese and their equipment. It also demonstrated that the Militia were an effective fighting force.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was an active}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}}, {{although most of the}} storms were weak and short-lived. Despite the high activity of weak storms during 2007, it was the first season to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane, a feat that would not be matched until 2017. It produced 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, sixhurricanes, and twomajor hurricanes. It officially started on June1 and ended on November30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed on May9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December13. The most intense hurricane, Dean, is tied for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall. The season was one of only six on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category5 hurricane.

40|$|Cement grouted soils, which {{consist of}} {{particulate}} soil media and cementation agents, {{have been widely}} used for the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness of weak ground and for the prevention of the leakage of ground water. <b>The</b> <b>strength,</b> elastic modulus, <b>and</b> Poisson’s ratio of grouted soils have been determined by classical destructive methods. However, the performance of grouted soils depends on several parameters such as the distribution of particle size of the particulate soil media, grouting pressure, curing time, curing method, and ground water flow. In this study, elastic wave velocities are used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> elastic modulus, which are generally obtained by classical strength tests. Nondestructive tests by using elastic waves at small strain are conducted before <b>and</b> during classical <b>strength</b> tests at large strain. The test results are compared to identify correlations between the elastic wave velocity measured at small strain <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness measured at large strain. The test results show that <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> stiffness have exponential relationship with elastic wave velocities.
