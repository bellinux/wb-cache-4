5|$|As {{public concern}} over the {{accident}} grew while information and education was limited, misconceptions arose {{about the nature of}} radiation hazards. Residents near a Buddhist temple protested and prevented the cremation of one of the victims, believing that the body could spread radiation, despite assurances by the OAEP <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congress overrode a Johnson veto to {{pass the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866 (also {{introduced}} by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a state <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government.|$|E
5|$|Curfew. Impose {{a curfew}} on {{specified}} persons, designating that they stay indoors or {{within a particular}} area between certain hours, unless they obtain a permit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> issued by a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant.|$|E
5000|$|The APA was not {{automatically}} hostile <b>to</b> immigrants--quite <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> Many members, perhaps a majority, were foreign-born, especially Orangemen (Protestants from Ireland), Britons, and Scandinavian Lutherans.|$|R

6000|$|... "First of all, I {{denied the}} most {{damaging}} statement--that I {{knew nothing about the}} thing. It seemed necessary <b>to</b> prove <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> which I did, though I had <b>to</b> admit <b>the</b> borrowing." ...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{academic}} suggestions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> in Salinas v. United States (1997), the Supreme Court {{held that}} the transaction itself need not involve federal funds. The $5,000 transactional amount may be satisfied by the value of intangible goods or services.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who, despite {{evidence}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> {{deny that the}} moon landings took place. The Apollo moon landing hoax claims helped propel conspiracy theories into a quasi-political narrative.|$|E
5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E
30|$|The {{method is}} pretty {{insensitive}} <b>to</b> noise; on <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> <b>the</b> results dramatically drops when the contrast turns non-uniform.|$|R
60|$|The major {{could not}} abstain from laughing, a little, at this {{exhibition}} of his father's esprit de corps; but native frankness, {{and love of}} truth, compelled him <b>to</b> admit <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1934, Gibson {{wrote and}} {{illustrated}} a children's book, The Teacup Whale, a tale which, while not explicitly radical, invited children to dream big dreams and <b>to</b> challenge <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> opinions of doubters.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} claims <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> Caroline Island {{was not the}} first point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show {{and replace it with a}} new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E
60|$|With respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first question, Hume {{denies that}} it is a {{necessary}} truth, {{in the sense that we}} are unable <b>to</b> conceive <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> <b>The</b> evidence by which he supports this conclusion in the Inquiry, however, is not strictly relevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> issue.|$|R

5|$|In 1758 the State of New Jersey {{purchased}} the Indian title to lands in that State, {{and as a}} consideration for the purchase, bought a tract of land as a residence for the Indians, having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State, any law or usage, or law then existing, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> notwithstanding. The Indians, {{from the time of}} purchase, lived upon the land until the year 1801, when they were authorized, by an act of the Legislature, to sell the land.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E

60|$|So Cardinal Perron {{after having}} spoke {{for an hour}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> admiration of all his hearers, <b>to</b> prove <b>the</b> {{existence}} of God; told some of his intimates {{that he could have}} spoken another hour, and much better, <b>to</b> prove <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{philosophy}} of science epistemological pluralism arose in opposition to reductionism <b>to</b> express <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> view {{that at least some}} natural phenomena cannot be fully explained by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach.|$|R
5|$|Marcus went {{to great}} lengths to {{sanitize}} her own and Wyatt's history. For example, she worked hard to keep both her name and the name of Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, , and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> exists.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent {{explicit}} congressional direction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> it must be presumed that a State does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car {{in which}} Baba was being driven went {{out of control and}} a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but from that point on he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move. In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
5|$|The Drapier's fourth letter, To the Whole People of Ireland, A Word or Two to the People of Ireland, A Short Defense of the People of Ireland, {{was written}} on 13 October 1724 and was either {{published}} on 21 October 1724 or on 22 October 1724, the day Lord Carteret arrived in Dublin. Throughout the letter, the Drapier pretends that Carteret's transfer to Ireland to enforce Wood's patent was a rumour produced by Wood's allies, although Swift had knowledge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Louvre is {{slightly}} askew of the Historic Axis (Axe historique), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins {{on the east}} in the Louvre courtyard and runs west along the Champs-Élysées. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune revealed that the Louvre was slightly askew of the Axe despite past appearances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> The Louvre {{can be reached by}} the Palais Royal– Musée du Louvre Métro or the Louvre-Rivoli stations.|$|E
