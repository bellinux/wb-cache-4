5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E

5|$|Fortune saw her occult novels as an {{important}} part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> of occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings.

5|$|Legacy of the Drow is a tetralogy, {{unlike the}} {{previous}} two trilogies.

The first three books, The Legacy, Starless Night, and Siege of Darkness, describe a drow attack on Mithril Hall. Wulfgar is seemingly slain by a yochlol, and Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to prevent his friends from being further attacked by dark elves. The drow launch a second attack against Mithril Hall during the Time of Troubles. It is eventually repelled and Drizzt returns to his friends.|$|E
