40|$|The <b>Thermoselect</b> <b>process</b> is a {{completely}} new solid waste treatment process which achieves pollution-free recycling of municipal solid waste and industrial waste by a high temperature gasification and reforming pro-cess. The process effectively recovers fuel gas from waste and recycles metal and other byproducts as resources. A stable gas engine power generation system using puri-fied synthesis gas from the <b>Thermoselect</b> <b>process</b> was also developed...|$|E
40|$|Lasting economizing is {{the only}} {{peaceful}} possibility for ensuring human life on Earth. Recycling of materials only contributes to lasting economizing if less resources and energy are required than for primary materials. Materials which have been collected and sorted after products have been disassemled result in secondary, tertiary etc. products with virtually the same properties as the primary materials. Non-specific material cycles connected with large scale processes e. g. shredders, hydrogenation, mixed waste recycling result in recycled goods of interior quality and costs which are greater {{than those of the}} primary materials. In contrast to metals, paper and glass, synthetic materials from products (e. g. televisions, surfboards, cars, washing machines etc.) especially require and permit differentiated recycling paths. Production waste: For decades now the sorted production waste generated during production, has been reintroduced to the production process of new products at the pr oduction location itself if financially interesting. At the same time {{this is one of the}} great advantages of synthetic materials when compared with other materials. Production waste made of steel, aluminium, glass and paper must be returned to the blast furnace, melting house or slurry. Specific synthetic material cycles: e. g. SMC, PVC window frames and floors, PET bottles, polystyrene, PE and PP disposable syringes, HDPE fuel tanks, PA 66 car suction pipes etc. Specific recycling processes: e. g. supercritical hydrooxidation for electronics waste and shredder light fraction alcoholysis for polyurethane. Non-specific recycling processes for organic raw materials: e. g. hydrogenation, high temperature gas generation, <b>thermoselect</b> <b>process</b> etc. Non-specific disposal procedures: e. g. shredders for synthetic materials (light fraction) lead to incineration or to the disposal site, because the costs for separating and sorting the mass synthetic materials are greater than the kilogram prices of the new materials. The selection of the optimum recycling of materials in the framework of lasting economizing takes place via integral accounting and evaluations...|$|E
