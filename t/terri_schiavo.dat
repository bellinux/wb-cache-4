5|$|<b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> died at a Pinellas Park hospice on March 31, 2005. Although {{there was}} concern that Schiavo would {{experience}} significant symptoms from dehydration with {{the removal of the}} feeding tube, studies have shown that patients who have their feeding tubes removed, such as the case of Schiavo, usually have a peaceful death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 25, 1990, <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> {{collapsed}} in a hallway of her St. Petersburg, Florida apartment. Firefighters and paramedics, arriving in response to her husband Michael's 9-1-1 call, found her face-down and unconscious. She was not breathing and had no pulse. They attempted to resuscitate {{her and she was}} transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her intubated and ventilated.|$|E
5|$|Jackson won {{re-election}} in the 2004 House of Representatives elections {{by a wide}} margin over Stephanie Kennedy Sailor. In 2005, Jackson supported legislation that gave the United States Federal Court of Appeals jurisdiction over the <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> case. In the 2006 election among Jackson's opponents was Libertarian Party candidate and African-American pastor Anthony Williams, an outspoken opponent of immigration. Jackson won with 85% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|From 1990 to 1993, Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers (<b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> parents) enjoyed an amicable relationship, {{with the}} Schindlers {{allowing}} Michael to live rent-free in their condominium for several months.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Fuhrman {{published}} Silent Witness: The Untold Story of <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> Death ( [...] ), which emphasized gaps in {{the medical}} and legal records that might allow {{for the possibility that}} Schiavo was murdered.|$|R
500|$|On June 18, 1990, {{the court}} {{appointed}} Michael <b>Schiavo</b> as <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> legal guardian; this appointment was not disputed by the Schindlers at the time. In May 1998, Michael Schiavo filed {{a petition to}} remove <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> feeding tube, which her parents opposed. Richard Pearse was appointed by the court as a second guardian ad litem (GAL), and on December 29, 1998, reported [...] "Dr. Jeffrey Karp's opinion of the ward's condition and prognosis is substantially shared among those physicians who have recently been involved in her treatment." [...] Pearse concluded from Karp's and Dr. Vincent Gambone's diagnosis of PVS that Schiavo was legally in a persistent vegetative state as defined by Florida Statutes, Title XLIV, Chapter 765, §101(12). This includes the [...] "absence of voluntary action" [...] and an [...] "inability to communicate or interact purposefully." ...|$|R
5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> was not responsive to swallowing tests and required a feeding tube, Judge Greer ruled {{that she was not}} capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E
5|$|On social issues, Lynch is {{considered}} a conservative to moderate Democrat. He is pro-life and has been attacked by pro-choice group NARAL. He sided with conservatives in the 2005 <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> case, voting for federal court intervention in the case. In more recent years, he has advocated for and defended funding for Planned Parenthoood. He has sided with Democratic leaders on gay rights issues, however, opposing a Federal Marriage Amendment and supporting granting medical benefits to domestic partners of federal employees. He supports same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|In November 1990, Michael Schiavo took Terri to the University of California, San Francisco for {{experimental}} nerve stimulation with a thalamic stimulator. The treatment took several months and was unsuccessful. He returned to Florida {{with her in}} January 1991 and admitted her as an inpatient to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center in Bradenton, Florida. On July 19, 1991, <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> {{was transferred to the}} Sabal Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular speech and occupational therapy until 1994. In mid-1993, Michael Schiavo requested a do not resuscitate order for her after she contracted a urinary tract infection.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the lack}} of a living will, a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge George Greer during the week of January 24, 2000 to {{determine}} what <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures. Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney George Felos, who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the Florida Supreme Court in 1990.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bill was}} {{signed into law}} while George W. Bush was Governor of Texas. Prior to the passage of this law, no protections or [...] "grace period" [...] existed.

5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

50|$|Five {{doctors are}} {{selected}} {{to provide their}} expert opinions to the trial. Schiavo's parents select Dr. William Maxfield, a retired radiologist, and Dr. William Hammesfahr, a neurologist. Michael Schiavo selects neurologists Dr. Ron Cranford and Dr. Melvin Greer (no relation to Judge George Greer). The court selects neurologist Dr. Peter Bambakidis. These five doctors examine <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Schiavo herself.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} weeks of <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo’s</b> life, {{patients}} and families in my clinical practice and in ethics con-sults referenced Ms. Schiavo during discussions of life-sustaining treat-ments. As the increasingly strident media discourse surrounding Ms. Schiavo and her family played itself out, I wondered how our hospital ethics committee (which also serves our hospital-affiliated hospice and nursing home) would address this case, and what lessons—if any—such a consult might offer.

5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 NDY {{protested the}} removal of <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo's</b> feeding tube.

The group has been highly critical of utilitarian philosophers such as Peter Singer of Princeton University. Coleman has called Professor Singer [...] "the most dangerous man on earth" [...] and accused him of advocating genocide. In June 2015 NDY organized protests against Singer's position that disabled newborn babies be killed. The protesters called for Princeton University to dismiss Singer.|$|R

Frist received enormous praise from former First Lady Nancy Reagan for supporting expanded federal financing for stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|Webster was {{a central}} figure in the <b>Terri</b> <b>Schiavo</b> case which {{involved}} a dispute between relatives on whether to remove the feeding tube of an unconscious {{woman who had been}} in a persistent vegetative state for years. In March 2005, he introduced SB 804 that would have prohibited such patients from being denied food and water if family members disagreed on the patient's wishes and if the patient had not expressed his wishes in writing when competent. The bill failed to pass the Senate by three votes.|$|E
