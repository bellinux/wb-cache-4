50|$|Bonds, {{mortgages}} and loans that are payable over a term exceeding one {{year would be}} fixed liabilities or long-term liabilities. However, the payments due on the long-term loans in {{the current fiscal year}} could be considered current liabilities if the amounts were material. Amounts due to lenders/ bankers are never shown as accounts payable/ <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>payable,</b> but will show up on the balance sheet of a company under the major heading of current liabilites, and often under the sub-heading of other current liabilites, instead of accounts payable, which are due to vendors. Other current liabilites are due for payment according to the terms of the loan agreements, but when lender liabilites are shown as current vs. long term, they are due within the current fiscal year or earlier. Therefore, late payments from a previous fiscal year will carry over into the same position on the balance sheet as current liabilities which are not late in payment. There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding past due payments to lenders, but this is not common practice. Lawsuits regarding loans payable are required to be shown on audited financial statements, but this is not necessarily common accounting practice.|$|E

40|$|Magistrska naloga temelji na obratnem kapitalu, kateremu bi vsa podjetja morala posvečati posebno pozornost. Dobro upravljanje z obratnim kapitalom pomeni premišljeno odločanje o obsegu zalog, terjatvah do kupcev in dolgovih. V nalogi se prepletata teoretični in empirični del. V empiričnem delu smo prikazali podatke za Skupino Gorenje, ki je eden izmed vodilnih evropskih izdelovalcev aparatov za dom. Na začetku naloge smo opredelili osnovne pojme, ki so povezani z obratnim kapitalom, v naslednjem poglavju smo opisali komponente obratnega kapitala, na koncu pa opredelili še politiko obratnega kapitala. Komponente obratnega kapitala so zaloge, terjatve do kupcev, denar in obveznosti do dobaviteljev, katerim smo v nalogi namenili največ pozornosti. Prikazali smo gibanje zalog, terjatev do kupcev in obveznosti do dobaviteljev za Skupino Gorenje, in sicer smo izračunali povprečne vrednosti le-teh, dneve vezav ter koeficiente obračanja. Ker mora podjetje obratna sredstva tudi financirati, smo poskušali preko krogotoka obratnega kapitala ugotoviti, kako hitrost obračanja obratnih sredstev vpliva na financiranje obratnega kapitala. Prišli smo do ugotovitve, da se s hitrejšim obračanjem obratnih sredstev znižujejo potrebe po virih financiranja. Za podjetje je dobro, da ima čim krajši cikel vezav zalog in terjatev do kupcev ter čim krajše dneve vezav obveznosti. Idealno bi bilo, če bi lahko podjetje zaloge in terjatve do kupcev financiralo z obveznostmi do dobaviteljev, vendar morajo podjetja v praksi običajno uporabljati še druge vire financiranja. V zadnjem poglavju smo se osredotočili na politiko obratnega kapitala, ki govori o višini obratnega kapitala v podjetju ter virih njihovega financiranja. Z ustrezno oblikovano politiko obratnega kapitala podjetje zniža potrebni obseg financiranja in poveča donosnost kapitala. The {{following}} master 2 ̆ 7 s dissertation {{is based}} on the working capital which companies should pay more attention to. Good working capital management means a well-informed decision-making when it comes to inventories, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables and debts. In the dissertation theoretical and empirical parts are intertwined with each other. The empirical part includes the data for Gorenje Group, one of the leading European manufacturers of household appliances. At the beginning of the dissertation there are definitions of basic concepts connected with the working capital, whereas the next chapter deals with the components of the working capital, finally followed by the working capital policy. Components of the working capital are inventories, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables, cash and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>payables</b> on which we have concentrated the most. The movements of inventories, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>payables</b> have been shown for Gorenje Group and furthermore, the average values of these, the turnover ratio in days and the turnover ratio have been calculated. Since the company needs to finance the working capital, we have tried to determine how the rate of turning affects the working capital financing by means of the working capital conversion cycle. We {{have come to the conclusion}} that the high turnover of the working capital reduces the need for financing the resources. It is better for the company to have shorter days of inventories turnover, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>payables</b> turnover. The perfect situation would be if the company could finance its inventories and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables with the <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>payables.</b> However, in reality companies need to search for other resources of financing. In the last chapter we are focused on the working capital policy, which talks about the amount of the working capital in the company and resources for their financing. With appropriately formed working capital policy the company reduces the necessary range of financing and increases the return of capital...|$|R

40|$|Internal Revenue Code section 351 (a) {{provides}} that no gain or loss shall be recognized if property {{is transferred to}} a corporation solely in exchange for its stock or securities and the transferors control the corporation immediately after the exchange. If, in addition to receiving stock or securities in an exchange that would otherwise qualify for section 351 treatment, a transferor receives other property or money [...] 2 ̆ 2 boot 2 ̆ 2 [...] any realized gain is recognized up {{to the amount of}} the money and the fair market value of the other property received. The transferee corporation 2 ̆ 7 s assumption of the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities or its acquisition from the transferor of property subject to a liability is not treated as boot unless the principal purpose of the assumption or acquisition was to avoid federal income tax or was not a bona fide business purpose. Regardless of the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s purpose, however, he will recognize gain under section 357 (c) {{to the extent that the}} sum of the liabilities transferred exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of the assets transferred. Section 357 (c) has caused significant problems for cash method taxpayers seeking to transfer the assets and liabilities of a going business in a section 351 exchange. In Peter Raich, a cash method taxpayer transferred all of the assets and liabilities of his sole proprietorship to a controlled corporation. The proprietorship 2 ̆ 7 s chief asset consisted of more than 77, 000 in trade accounts receivable; its liabilities exceeded 45, 000 and included more than 37, 000 in <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>payable.</b> While the Commissioner of Internal Revenue stipulated that the transaction qualified as a section 351 exchange, he successfully claimed in the Tax Court that the <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> were liabilities within the terms of section 357 (c), and that the trade accounts receivable had a zero basis. Accordingly, although the book value of the transferred assets was almost twice the face amount of the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities, Raich recognized a taxable gain of 34, 741. 08, the amount by which the liabilities assumed by the corporation exceeded his basis in the transferred assets. Two subsequent Tax Court cases, Wilford E. Thatcher and David Rosen, have followed Raich; the Second Circuit, in Bongiovanni v. Commissioner, has rejected it...|$|E

50|$|A more {{complete}} definition is that current liabilities are obligations {{that will be}} settled by current assets or by {{the creation of new}} current liabilities. <b>Accounts</b> <b>payable</b> are due within 30 days, and are paid within 30 days, but do often run past 30 days or 60 days in some situations. The laws regarding late payment and claims for unpaid <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> is related to the issue of <b>accounts</b> <b>payable.</b> An operating cycle for a firm is the average time that is required to go from cash to cash in producing revenues. For example, <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> for goods, services or supplies that were purchased for use in the operation of the business and payable within a normal period would be current liabilities. Amounts listed on a balance sheet as <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> represent allbills payable to vendors of a company, whether or not the bills are less than 31 days old or more than 30 days old. Therefore, late payments are not disclosed on the balance sheet for <b>accounts</b> <b>payable.</b> There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding age of <b>accounts</b> <b>payable,</b> but this is not common accounting practice.
