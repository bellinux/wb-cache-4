5|$|The 1999 UEFA Champions League Final was a {{football}} match between Manchester United of England and Bayern Munich of Germany, played at Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain, on 26 May 1999, {{to determine the}} winner of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League. It is remembered for injury time goals from Manchester United's Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær, which cancelled out Mario Basler's early goal to give Manchester United a 2–1 win. United's victory completed a treble-winning season, after they had won the Premier League and FA Cup. Bayern were also playing for a treble, having won the Bundesliga and reached the DFB-Pokal final, although they went on <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>that</b> match.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if {{the stakes are}} high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects of ego depletion. This may seem surprising but in fact it may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>that</b> capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength. When people do exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated.|$|E

Shikhar Dhawan, Dale Steyn and Cameron White were the only players who helped the team put up a fight.

Using his reliance and her discovering his real identity, he gets the once isolated Kai Qi to start opening up and warm up to others.

500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>that</b> option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lawsuit, which Rolling Stone called [...] "the music industry's nastiest legal skirmishes in years," [...] was {{problematic}} for Zomba for two main reasons. [...] First, having heard that 'N Sync was signed to Jive, the Backstreet Boys {{did not want}} to be a part of the label anymore. [...] Second, the lawsuit temporarily strained Zomba's relationship with BMG, whose distribution deal with Zomba was coming to a close. [...] Jive initially announced that they would not renew their deal with BMG, but reconsidered following the lawsuit with BMG and Trans Continental. [...] The distribution deal may have been a determining factor in the outcome of the lawsuit, since distributed Zomba product accounted for 5.5% of BMG's US market share, and company CEO Strauss Zelnick was under pressure not <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>that.</b> [...] They also signed a new deal with the Backstreet Boys that gave the band a 20% royalty rate.|$|E

In some countries, {{including}} the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, the band was credited as 'Starsound' and the medley itself was named [...] "Stars on 45".

2500|$|The Fanzine's Richard Parks, {{interviewing}} Mikey Heppner, {{noted that}} many of the album's lyrics were threatening in some way; in addition to the aforementioned references to death, other songs have dark subtexts. [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] has a straightforward message of [...] "one frustrated person warning someone else", according to Heppner, while [...] "Talk to Her" [...] seemed according to Parks to be [...] a distorted take on the Beatles song [...] "She Loves You". [...] "In 'She Loves You', the guy is trying to help his friend who's in a relationship," [...] explained Parks, [...] "but in 'Talk to Her' it becomes a threat - more like, I'm going to take your girl away from you." [...] Heppner remarked that a closer comparison would be to the other Beatles tune [...] "You're Going <b>to</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>That</b> Girl", whose message about losing in a relationship was similarly blunt. Heppner acknowledged that the songs [...] "fit together" [...] with regard to their apparent similarities in subject matter, but denied the presence of an intentional unifying theme around which the songs were written.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first major}} {{recorded}} {{wars in the}} territory of modern-day France itself revolved around the Gallo-Roman conflict that predominated from 60 BC to 50 BC. The Romans eventually emerged victorious through the campaigns of Julius Caesar. After {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire, a Germanic tribe known as the Franks took control of Gaul by defeating competing tribes. The [...] "land of Francia," [...] from which France gets its name, had high points of expansion under kings Clovis I and Charlemagne, who established the nucleus of the future French state. In the Middle Ages, rivalries with England prompted major conflicts such as the Norman Conquest and the Hundred Years' War. With an increasingly centralized monarchy, the first standing army since Roman times, and the use of artillery, France expelled the English from its territory and came out of the Middle Ages as the most powerful nation in Europe, only <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>that</b> status to the Holy Roman Empire and Spain following defeat in the Italian Wars. The Wars of Religion crippled France in the late 16th century, but a major victory over Spain in the Thirty Years' War made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more. In parallel, France developed its first colonial empire in Asia, Africa, and in the Americas. Under Louis XIV France achieved military supremacy over its rivals, but escalating conflicts against increasingly powerful enemy coalitions checked French ambitions and left the kingdom bankrupt {{at the opening of the}} 18th century.|$|E

This dude was like, 'Original Weezy tha God! You tha boss! Weezy tha God!' It's crazy. They love us, 'cause we show love out there." [...] The video was released on May 11, 2010, on Drake's blog and on MTV. In an interview with MTV News the video's director, Anthony Mandler said, [...] "Part of the objective of making this video was to do that same twist again, to give you something unexpected, not only tonality with the song but with the video thematically. It's kind of like the anti-love love story. It's really about crossing lines, what was said in the first scene. It's about really understanding what's right and what's wrong and it's really easy <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>that</b> when you're the center of attention. He did it fearlessly, he did it without any sign of hesitation. He wanted to do something that went further with the song, that took the essence of the song but communicated it with imagery that made people think, rather than go up the middle and make an obvious R video." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a new model}} of the war of attrition, based on a geographical or territorial dispute. Both sides try to extend their boundaries, and the level of effort at each time is endogenous. There are two kinds of stationary equilibria, one with fighting to completion, the other with a cessation of hostilities. As a player gets closer <b>to</b> <b>losing,</b> <b>that</b> player's probability of winning battles falls, social welfare rises, and the levels of effort of both players rise. A draw or standoff is possible. The theory is applied to a variety of conflicts, including wars and attempts at market domination...|$|R
