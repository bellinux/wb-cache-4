40|$|Spring geophytes {{produce larger}} storage organs and present delayed leaf {{senescence}} under lower growth <b>temperature.</b> <b>Bulb</b> and leaf carbon metabolism were investigated in Erythronium americanum to identify {{some of the}} mechanisms that permit this improved growth at low temperature. Plants were grown under three day/night temperature regimes: 18 / 14 _C, 12 / 8 _C, and 8 / 6 _C. Starch accumulated more slowly in the bulb at lower temperatures {{probably due to the}} combination of lower net photosynthetic rate and activation of a 'futile cycle' of sucrose synthesis and degradation. Furthermore, bulb cell maturation was delayed at lower temperatures, potentially due to the delayed activation of sucrose synthase leading to a greater sink capacity. Faster starch accumulation and the smaller sink capacity that developed at higher temperatures led to early starch saturation of the bulb. Thereafter, soluble sugars started to accumulate in both leaf and bulb, most probably inducing decreases in fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase activity, triose-phosphate utilization in the leaf, and the induction of leaf senescence. Longer leaf life span and larger bulbs at lower temperature appear to be due to an improved equilibrium between carbon fixation capacity and sink strength, thereby allowing the plant to sustain growth {{for a longer period of}} time before feedback inhibition induces leaf senescence.

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is the coupled hydro-thermo-mechanical {{analysis}} of a deep radioactive waste disposal using a finite element formulation for thermo-elasto-plastic multiphase geomaterials. The finite element model (COMES-GEO fem code) is based on Porous Media Mechanics where the ACMEG-T thermo-elasto-plastic constitutive model for saturated soils has been implemented. The multiphase material is considered as made of a solid skeleton and open pores, which are filled with water or water and gas. In particular the multiphase media is modelled as a deforming porous continuum where heat, water and gas flow are taken into account]. The gas phase is modelled as an ideal gas composed of dry air and water vapour. Phase changes of water (evaporation-condensation, adsorption-desorption) and heat transfer through conduction and convection, as well as latent heat transfer are considered. Two cases are analysed. Case 1 simulates the normal life condition with the maximum temperature in the canister of 95 °C. This computation reveals a <b>temperature</b> <b>bulb</b> surrounding the vertical well initially, that diffuses toward the boundaries and then contracts because of {{the reduction of the}} temperature in the well. The volumetric strain distribution is characterized by an initial dilatation near to the well with a consequent compression near the boundaries. The volumetric plastic strain distribution reveals a very small damaged zone surrounding the well. In case 2, a failure condition is simulated, with a maximum temperature of 320 °C describing the collapse of the container of the waste. In this case, a huge damaged zone surrounding the well is described (with respect to the normal life conditions) which become partially saturated because of formation of water vapour...|$|E

CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2011 (in press). ### INTRODUCTION The *Caenorhabditis elegans* embryo is {{particularly}} amenable to microscopy and embryological studies {{because of its}} short developmental time, transparent shell, and nonpigmented cells. The agar mount described in this protocol is {{an easy way to}} prepare live *C. elegans* embryos for microscopic visualization. The mount slightly embeds the embryo in agar to hold it in place. The mount also slightly compresses the embryo to provide consistent orientation such that every embryo will be positioned with either its right side or its left side facing the objective. Other techniques can result in random orientations that complicate analysis and make identification of individual blastomeres more challenging. ### RELATED INFORMATION Protocols for collection and analysis of four-dimensional (4 D) data can be found in [Acquisition of 4 D DIC Microscopic Data to Determine Cell Contacts in *Caenorhabditis elegans* Embryos]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 a) and [Analysis of 4 D DIC Microscopic Data to Determine Cell Contacts in *Caenorhabditis elegans* Embryos]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 b). An ablation technique for killing individual cells within the embryo (to facilitate the study of cell interactions within the *C. elegans* embryo) is described in [Laser Killing of Blastomeres in *Caenorhabditis elegans*]([URL] (Walston and Hardin 2010 c). An alternative method for mounting embryos that involves raising a coverslip on grease “feet” is found in [Suspended Embryo Mount for Imaging *Caenorhabditis elegans* (]([URL] and Isaacson 2010). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Agar (5 %) - *Melt the agar just before use*. - *C. elegans* (gravid hermaphrodites) - M 9 buffer for agar mounts - Valap for agar mounts ### Equipment 1. Aspirator tube assembly (15 -in., for mouth pipette) - Bunsen burner - Coverslips, 18 × 18 -mm (# 1) - Eyelash brush (eyelash glued to end of round toothpick) - Microscope - *For assembling the mount, a standard stereoscope is required for all steps with C. elegans. To identify early embryos (one to four cells), a total zoom of 80 X or greater is recommended. We use Leica S 8 APO microscopes with 10 X eyepieces and Leica MZ 12. 5 microscopes with 16 X eyepieces and 1. 0 X objective lenses*. - Microscope slides, 25 × 75 -mm (1 mm thick) and single depression (3 mm thick) - Paintbrush - Pasteur pipettes (6 -in.) - Pick (platinum wire) - *To make the pick, insert 1 in. of 30 -gauge platinum or 90 % platinum, 10 % iridium wire into a 6 -in Pasteur pipette. Heat it in a flame until the glass melts around the wire. Use flat end hobby pliers or a small tack hammer to flatten the end of the pick*. - Pipettes, calibrated glass (50 -μL) - Razor blade - Syringes (1 cc) with 27 gauge × 1 / 2 -in. needles or scalpel (# 15 curved blade) (see Step 2) - Tape, laboratory label - Tissue (e. g., Kimwipe) ### METHOD *The total time needed for the experienced is 10 - 15 min and for the novice is 30 min*. 1. Use a platinum wire pick to move ~ 5 gravid C. elegans hermaphrodites from a culture dish to a single-depression microscope slide mostly filled with M 9 buffer for agar mounts. - *The number of hermaphrodites needed depends on the number of embryos required at the appropriate stage*. - By holding a syringe with a needle in each hand, place the needles on either side of a hermaphrodite, and draw the flat sides of the tips of the needles across each other to cut the worm in half transversely (Fig. 1 A,B). The embryos will be released from the halves of the hermaphrodite. Use an eyelash brush to carefully prod the halves to expel any remaining embryos. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Isolation of *C. elegans* embryos and preparation for mounting on a slide. (A,B) Gravid hermaphrodites are cut in half with 27 × 1 / 2 -in. needles. (C) At a higher magnification, embryos are sorted and are grouped using an eyelash. (D) Embryos and M 9 buffer are transferred using a mouth pipette. *It is important to cut as close to the vulva as possible to release newly fertilized embryos in the uterus. This step can also be conducted by cutting the worm in half with a # 15 curved blade scalpel*. 3. Sort the embryos using the eyelash brush, and brush them together into a group of ~ 10 embryos (Fig. 1 C). *Embryos will tend to stick slightly to each other when grouped. If you desire a certain stage of embryogenesis, it is at this point that the embryo stage should be assessed and the embryos sorted appropriately. Two-cell stage embryos are the easiest developmental stage to collect*. 4. Make an agar pad: - i. Using laboratory label tape, tape two flat microscope slides parallel and one slide width apart on the laboratory bench. - ii. Place a third slide between the two taped slides (Fig. 2 A). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2. ** Making an agar pad. (A) Three slides are placed on the bench, and the outer two are taped down to the bench. (B) A drop of molten 5 % agar is placed onto the middle slide. A fourth slide is then placed perpendicular to the three original slides. The top slide is compressed over the taped slides. (C) The finished slide is sealed with valap. Using a toothpick to make hash marks in the valap (arrows) aids in finding the grouping of embryos on the compound scope. - iii. Using a 6 -in. Pasteur pipette, place three to four drops of molten 5 % agar onto the middle slide. - iv. Immediately lay the fourth slide perpendicular to the other three slides over the agar, and press it over the taped slides to flatten the agar before it cools (Fig. 2 B). 5. Once the agar has set, use a razor blade to trim excess agar from the edges of the slides. Carefully slide apart the untaped slides, so that the agar pad is left in the center of one slide. *See Troubleshooting*. 6. Prepare a mouth pipette: - i. Heat a glass 50 -μL pipette in the flame of a Bunsen burner. - ii. Once the glass is soft and fluid, remove it from the flame, and quickly pull apart the ends. - iii. Break the two ends apart to create a pipette with a tapered end with a diameter of ~ 40 μm. - iv. Place the pipette in a mouth pipette aspirator. 7. Using the mouth pipette, transfer the grouping of embryos (from Step 3) and ~ 20 μL of M 9 buffer to the corner of the agar pad on the microscope slide (Fig. 1 D). 8. Brush the embryos out of the M 9 buffer {{into the center of the}} slide using the eyelash. Position the embryos in a single layer side by side. 9. Set the edge of a coverslip at the side of the agar pad opposite the M 9 buffer and slowly drop it so that the coverslip lands on the embryos before it contacts the M 9 buffer. Use a tissue to wick excess buffer from the edges of the coverslip, and wick air bubbles from under the coverslip. *See Troubleshooting*. 10. Trim excess agar from the edges of the coverslip using a razor blade. Seal the edges of the coverslip with melted valap for agar mounts using a paintbrush (Fig. 2 C). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The agar pad dries to the slide before it can be used. **[Step 5]** - **Solution**: Make the pad immediately before use. Stereomicroscopes with light sources mounted under the stage have the potential to heat the stage after long use, which can quickly dry agar pads. Using a stereomicroscope with an external bulb or a cool <b>temperature</b> <b>bulb</b> will reduce this problem. - **Problem**: When a coverslip is placed on the slide, all the embryos wash to the edge of the coverslip. **[Step 9]** - **Solution**: Too much M 9 buffer is used, and the M 9 buffer is hitting the embryos before the coverslip can land on them and hold them in the agar. Use less M 9 buffer. - **Problem**: The slide has air bubbles under the coverslip. **[Step 9]** - **Solution**: Use more M 9 buffer. This will allow M 9 buffer to completely wash under the coverslip. Too much M 9 buffer, however, will cause embryos to wash away (see previous problem). - **Problem**: Embryos fail to develop after mounting. - **Solution**: Consider the following: - i. One-cell embryos are especially vulnerable to mechanical stress and are challenging to mount without killing. If studying a later stage of development, the likelihood of embryos surviving is markedly increased if two-cell or later stage embryos are used to make the mount. - ii. Groupings larger than 15 - 20 embryos often display increased lethality caused by oxygen starvation. By keeping groupings of embryos around 10 embryos, oxygen starvation should not be a problem. ### DISCUSSION Mounting *C. elegans* embryos on agar mounts provides a stable long-term environment for microscopic analysis of development. The slight compression from the coverslip will result in embryos reproducibly positioned with either the left or the right side facing toward the objective lens. During later stages of embryogenesis, embryos turn such that left-side views become dorsal views and right-side views become ventral views. Embryos on agar mounts will survive and will hatch from the eggshell on the mount. Embryos prepared with an agar mount are amenable to both light microscopy (with differential interference contrast [DIC] optics) and confocal microscopy. Alternative methods for mounting embryos, such as poly-L-lysine-coated slides with grease feet (see [Suspended Embryo Mount for Imaging *Caenorhabditis elegans*]([URL] [Mohler and Isaacson 2010]) or polymer beads, are often used to avoid compression to the embryo. However, these techniques typically result in random embryo orientation, which can complicate analysis of development. Additionally, the slight compression of the coverslip seems to have little to no effect on development; in most cases, avoidance of such compression is unnecessary. In conclusion, preparing *C. elegans* embryos on an agar mount is a simple technique that can be easily mastered and is regularly performed by undergraduates in the investigators’ laboratories. It provides a consistent embryonic orientation and environment that is suitable for long-term microscopy of *C. elegans* embryos. ### REFERENCES 1.

The natural process of water evaporation along with an air-moving system is utilised by evaporative coolers to generate effective cooling. Two temperatures are vital when dealing with evaporative cooling systems such as dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> and wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature.</b> If the dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> and wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> are 35 °C and 15 °C, respectively, the maximum drop in temperature due to evaporative cooling would theoretically be 20 °C. The cooling effect due to perspiration on the human skin is an example of evaporative cooling. In hot and humid climates, the cooling effect is less because of the high moisture content of the surrounding air. The four major factors that affect the rate of evaporation are relative humidity, air temperatures, air movement and surface area. There are two general methods of evaporative cooling: direct and indirect.|$|R

50|$|Assuming {{constant}} pressure, sigma heat {{is solely}} {{a function of}} the wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> of the air. For this reason, humidity need not be taken into account unless dry-bulb temperature measurements are used.

In contrast, the dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> can vary even for processes where there is no such net energy change. This difference may be understood by examining evaporative cooling. During evaporative cooling, all energy lost from air molecules as sensible heat is gained as latent heat by water molecules evaporating into that air.

In keeping with this, the wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> also remains unchanged, as its reading already represented the maximum possible amount of evaporative cooling.

The measurement uncertainty of the relative humidity affected by the accuracy of dry and wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> and the numeric values of measurement uncertainty were evaluated for various conditions. The uncertainty of wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> was the main factor on the RH measurement uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work to make a study of thermal comfort index in six regions {{of the state of}} Paraiba and thereby identify which region has better thermal comfort condition for dairy cattle. For this, data from the meteorological database for teaching and research at the National Institute of Meteorology of six weather stations were used, distributed in all regions of the state, from 2011 to 2014. The analysis showed region of effect (P< 0. 05) for the environmental variables dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> relative humidity and the temperature and humidity index. There was a significant interaction (P< 0. 05) between the region and time of day to dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> and temperature and moisture content. The temperature humidity index, in the regions of Brejo and Agreste are those with better conditions for thermal comfort and well-being for the creation of dairy cows in the state of Paraiba, Brazil. Environmental variables and the temperature and moisture content, in the regions of Brejo and Agreste are those with better conditions for thermal comfort and welfare for the creation of dairy cows in the Paraiba state, Brazil. High temperatures in the afternoon show that management strategies should be adopted in all regions of the state to obtain maximum productivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} analysis of modern cooling and heating system for cabinet using cellulose cooling pad is introduced in this paper. Average maximum dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> of 41. 5 °C and {{average relative humidity}} of 38 % is selected for the analysis. An experimental study is conducted in a room equipped with a fan and cooling pad for cooling system. Rectangular pads with rigid cellulose material is used called cellulose cooling pad. The dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> and humidity are estimated. Temperature difference and humidity variation with air mass flow and flow of water are plotted on the graph. Experimental measurements were carried out in comparison with desert cooler for 3 different days inside the room. The experimental results showed that advance cooling and heating system for cabinet maintaining the humidity in the specific range of 60 % which is nearer to human comfort. The overall efficiency {{of the system is}} quite high and in combination with the dry and warm outside climate conditions enabled the air to enter the room with a temperature even 12 ºC to 13 ºC lower than that of outside air temperature. It is observed that material with higher wetted surface area gives higher saturation efficienc...|$|R
40|$|Comfortable {{and human}} health are {{affected}} more by climate than any {{other elements of the}} physical environment. Physiological functions of the human and animal body respond to changes in the weather, and incidence of certain disease shows a close correlation with climate and seasons. Of the climatic elements which affect the human body, the most important one is wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature.</b> The body 2 ̆ 7 s response to wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> is affected by the rates of conduction, convection, and radiation heat away from the body, and by cooling due to evaporation at the skin surface and in the respiratory tracts. The resulting temperature affect is known as the sensible temperature. It varies not only with the humidity factor and air movement at skin surface but also from one person to another, and it is, therefore, not measurable by any instrument. The values of sensible temperature and the wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> however, are approximately the same when the skin is moist and is exposed to calm air at normal dry <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> since evaporation will then be the principal cooling process. From the point of view the wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> is the most suitable element of human sensation and human life. (1) The average insensible comfortable temperature in the thermal sensation varied in a year as follows: [表省略] (2) Bioclimatic charts in Japan were built up with wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> mainly. Each chart is applicable to inhabitants at elevations not in excess of 100 m above the sea level, with customary outdoor clothing, doing sedentary or light work. The seasonal variation of thermal sensation and pleasantness were shown in the figures and tables. 体感気候を人類および農業生物に利用する考えで,いろいろな角度から調査した. まず,体感表を作り 10 人で 3 年間毎日感測した. その結果動いている人間にとつて湿球温度が他のどの気候要素よりも最も関係が深いことがわかつた. これは皮膚表面での熱収支を考えると当然といえる. 又快感気候を乾球温度と湿球温度によつて調査した. その結果従来の研究者によるものよりやや低温側で,月により広い範囲にわたることがわかつた. これは人の着衣状態の季節変動があること,戸外の軽作業後に相当するためであろう. 従来の研究者は特別の人工気候室を作り,坐業時に実験したためであろう. 一般的には人間あるいは動物は常時活動しているものであるから,著者によるものの方が妥当かと思われる. 次にこの湿球温度を使つて,日本の気候の分布を調査し,さらにこの湿球温度に季節用語をあてはめ,その季節の分布,月による移動(北進,南進) を調査し,人間生活あるいは農業上の新品種導入の際の参考になるよう考慮した...|$|R
30|$|Mathur et al. (2007) {{employed}} MLP {{with back}} propagation learning and perform time series analysis to predict max and min temperature forecasting. However, no standard database is employed and results are subjective. Hayati and Mohebi (2007) employed three layer MLP network, six hidden neurons, sigmoid activation function for hidden layers and a pure linear function for the output layer. The input parameters are gained after each 3  h that include wind speed, wind, direction, dry <b>bulb,</b> <b>temperature,</b> wet <b>bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> relative humidity, dew point, pressure, visibility, amount of cloud. The other input parameters were measured daily: gust wind, mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, mean humidity, mean pressure, sunshine, radiation, evaporation. However, no standard database is employed and results are subjective. Baboo and Shereef (2010) also employed MLP three layers structure with standard back- propagation learning algorithm and claim least error. The input parameters include atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and its direction.|$|R
