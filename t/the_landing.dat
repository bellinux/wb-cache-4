An additional two Beauforts could also observe for any bombardments made by the warships.

5|$|Alamo Force was {{responsible}} for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support <b>the</b> <b>landing,</b> could be made operational. This date also gave <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals. As Arawe {{was believed to be}} only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than the one which had been intended for <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at Goodenough Island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat. After <b>the</b> <b>landing,</b> holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft ammunition, for which a 10-day supply was thought necessary. The assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

Montgomery's revised plan widened <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> area to include all of the coastline between the River Orne and the eastern coast of the Cotentin Peninsula; five divisions would land on the beaches, and supported by three airborne divisions to land {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> areas to secure their flanks and protect <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> troops from counterattack.

2500|$|At night, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> cools off {{faster than}} the ocean due to {{differences}} in their heat capacity, which forces the dying of the daytime sea breeze as the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> approaches that of the ocean.

If there is sufficient moisture and instability available, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> breeze can cause showers, or even thunderstorms, over the water.

5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first lift on 17 September arrived over <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced {{when they came in}} to land. Two of the gliders landed on soft ground, which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined with the majority of their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The lift on 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its tow aircraft developed engine trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being hit. As a result, one Hamilcar landed short of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third lift on 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the tow rope between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|E
