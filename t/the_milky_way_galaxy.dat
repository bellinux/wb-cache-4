50|$|Eris is a {{computer}} simulation of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>galaxy's</b> physics.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{population of}} <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellite <b>galaxies</b> offer a unique testing ground for galaxy formation theory on small-scales. Our novel approach {{was to investigate}} the clustering of <b>the</b> known <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellite <b>galaxies</b> and to quantify the amount of substructure within their distribution using a two-point correlation function statistic in each of three spaces: configuration space, line-of-sight velocity space, and four-dimensional phase-space. These results were compared to those for three sets of subhaloes in the Via Lactea II Cold Dark Matter simulation defined to represent the luminous dwarfs. We found no evidence at a significance level above 2 -sigma of substructure within the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellite <b>galaxies</b> in any of the three spaces. The "luminous" subhalo sets are more strongly clustered than are <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellites in all three spaces and over a broader range of scales in four-dimensional phase-space. Each of the "luminous" subhalo sets are clustered as a result of substructure within their line-of-sight velocity space distributions at greater than 3 -sigma significance, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellite <b>galaxies</b> are randomly distributed in line-of-sight velocity space. While our comparison is with only one Cold Dark Matter simulation, the inconsistencies between <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellite <b>galaxies</b> and <b>the</b> Via Lactea II subhalo sets for all clustering methods suggest a potential new 'small-scale' tension between Cold Dark Matter theory and <b>the</b> observed <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellites. Future work will obtain a more robust comparison between <b>the</b> observed <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> satellites and Cold Dark Matter theory by studying additional simulations.
