5|$|Zobel and Carson {{helped to}} {{establish}} the nature of noise in electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise {{will always be a}} limiting factor in what is possible to transmit. Thus, they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel.|$|E
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E

5|$|The privateers {{arrived at}} Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped {{overnight}} before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine {{that led to}} the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into view {{at the end of the}} ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.|$|E
5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E
5|$|To {{relieve the}} {{garrison}} of Svetigrad, Skanderbeg continually harassed the Ottoman army. Many of these attacks had been surprise ambushes of isolated Ottoman forces. Hoping to evade Ottoman patrols, Skanderbeg moved towards the Ottoman camp. On June 22, Skanderbeg led a night {{attack on the}} Ottoman camp which disillusioned the Ottoman soldiers who had been expecting a quiet campaign. Soon after, when the besiegers were taking their afternoon naps, Skanderbeg sent Moses with some men, again dressed as peasants, inside the Ottoman camp to reconnoiter for a future assault. Skanderbeg spoke to his troops, encouraging them not to take booty from the camp as this might give the Ottoman forces time to react and launch a counterattack. That night, the Albanians launched their attack, but <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armor and the neighing of the horses inhibited a complete surprise. The periphery of the camp was thrown into confusion, {{but the bulk of}} the Turkish troops gathered and organized themselves, pushing the Albanians out of the camp but not before suffering heavy casualties. To prevent further attacks of this sort, Murad detached a contingent of troops under Firuz Pasha to watch the Albanians but it was prone to desertion and thoroughly destroyed with its baggage train being captured. A breach in the walls of Svetigrad was made, but the following infantry assault was repulsed. The Albanians began to hope that the sultan would now be returning to Edirne.|$|E

5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.|$|E
5|$|Townsend {{subsequently}} then {{reported that}} he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength with support weapons—likely D445 Battalion—while the level of proficiency indicated that it might also include North Vietnamese Army (NVA) elements. However, due to earlier warnings that the Viet Cong were preparing to attack Nui Dat that evening, {{prior to the start}} of the operation Graham had ordered Townsend to return to base that afternoon, and this restriction remained extant. Likewise, with Operation Renmark scheduled to start the following morning, A Company 5 RAR—then at Dat Do protecting the artillery—would also need to be released before nightfall, adding to the requirement to conclude the operation that afternoon. Regardless, this restriction had only served to make B Company's task all the more difficult, with Mackay facing demands to complete the action while at the same time not become decisively engaged and unable to withdraw his company. At 16:17 Townsend was ordered to prepare his battalion for a helicopter extraction which was due to begin an hour later, while at 17:15 he was ordered to break contact immediately, however this proved impossible as 5 Platoon remained in heavy contact. Mackay now estimated that he would be unable to get forward to support the beleaguered platoon for a further 30 minutes; however, by 17:50 he realised that the Viet Cong had moved between them and A Company. Yet even while the Viet Cong continued to heavily engage both A and B Companies, the remainder of the Australian battalion and the APCs were beginning to line up on the landing zone in preparation for returning to Nui Dat. The order was finally rescinded when it became clear that both companies were unable to break-off the engagement. Meanwhile, a number of bush fires were now burning through the area, detonating discarded ammunition and adding to <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{phase noise}} {{is a very}} {{important}} index to wireless system, especially in millimeter-wave continuous wave radar systems. <b>The</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal, which is firstly leaked from transmitter and then mixed to intermediate frequency band by the local oscillator (Tx-IF), will worsen <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> superheterodyne radar system used for Doppler velocity detection. In this paper, the coherent analysis is applied on <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> after nonlinear process, which shows that <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tx-IF is affected by those factors: <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitter and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local oscillator, and the correlationship between each other. In practice, by reducing <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitter and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local oscillator and ameliorating <b>the</b> correlationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two phase <b>noises,</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tx-IF can be improved greatly. Such proposition is successfully applied in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a millimeter-wave Doppler radar working at 95 GHz.
