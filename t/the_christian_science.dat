5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Publishing Society publishes several periodicals, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Monitor, {{winner of}} seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002. This had a daily circulation in 1970 of 220,000, which by 2008 had contracted to 52,000. In 2009 it {{moved to a}} largely online presence with a weekly print run. In the 1980s the church produced its own television programs, and in 1991 it founded a 24-hour news channel, which closed with heavy losses after 13 months.|$|E

5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church was {{attractive}} to women because it offered professional opportunities when {{it was difficult for}} women to find work outside the home. As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Journal, 12 were women.|$|E

5|$|The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science was {{published}} in November 1909 in New York by Doubleday, Page & Company. Mostly ghostwritten by the novelist Willa Cather, {{the book is a}} highly critical account of the life of Mary Baker Eddy (1821–1910), the founder of Christian Science, and the early history of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> church in 19th-century New England.|$|E
5|$|The Manual of the Mother Church {{prohibits the}} church from {{publishing}} membership figures, {{but it does}} provide the names of Christian Science practitioners, Scientists trained to offer Christian Science prayer on behalf of others. In 1941 there were 11,200 practitioners in the United States, against 965 in 2015 (1,249 worldwide). Stark writes that clusters of practitioners listed in <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Journal in 1998 {{were living in the}} same retirement communities.|$|E
5|$|A doctor {{performed}} an autopsy and showed Eddy her husband's diseased heart, but she responded by giving more interviews about mesmerism. Fraser {{wrote that the}} articles made Eddy a household name, a real-life version of the charismatic and beautiful Verena Tarrant in Henry James's The Bostonians (1885–1886), with her interest in spiritualism, women's rights and the mind cure. Shortly after the death, Eddy moved next door to 571 Columbus Avenue with several students. The following year, 1883, she founded the Journal of Christian Science (later called <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Journal), which spread news of her ideas across the United States.|$|E

5|$|At a {{time when}} medical {{practice}} was in its infancy, and patients often fared better if left alone, <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> message was a welcome one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Cather {{discussed}} her authorship {{privately with}} her father and friends, but otherwise said {{she was not the}} author. She was reluctant to discuss most of her work before O Pioneers! (1913). According to L. Brent Bohlke, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains some excellent writing and character analysis, Bohkle wrote, it is not well-structured; the editing had failed to rid the book of the serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Stouck adds that Cather wanted to distance herself from journalism, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> church.|$|E
5|$|Eddy and 26 {{followers}} {{were granted}} a charter in 1879 to found the Church of Christ, Scientist, and in 1894 the Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, {{was built in}} Boston, Massachusetts. Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 members by 1936, a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000. The church {{is known for its}} newspaper, <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Monitor, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its Reading Rooms, which {{are open to the public}} in around 1,200 cities.|$|E

5|$|Eddy copyrighted her book, {{then called}} The Science of Life, in July 1874. Three of her students, George Barry, Elizabeth Newhall and Daniel Spofford, paid a Boston printer, W. F. Brown and Company, $2,200 {{to produce the}} first edition. The printer began work in September 1874, but stopped {{whenever}} the advance payment ran out, so progress was slow. The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Publishing Company.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, <b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Science</b> Monitor {{reported}} that Pan Gulf had become {{stuck in the}} mud off Governors Island after her crew misjudged how far {{to back out of}} her berth at the Army base there.

The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum had been laid up in a reserve fleet at New Orleans.|$|E
