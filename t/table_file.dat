5000|$|In some cases, {{data on a}} {{hard disk}} drive can be {{unreadable}} due to damage to the partition <b>table</b> or <b>file</b> system, or to (intermittent) media errors. In {{the majority of these}} cases, at least a portion of the original data can be recovered by repairing the damaged partition <b>table</b> or <b>file</b> system using specialized data recovery software such as Testdisk; software like dd rescue can image media despite intermittent errors, and image raw data when there is partition <b>table</b> or <b>file</b> system damage. This type of data recovery can be performed by people without expertise in drive hardware as it requires no special physical equipment or access to platters.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} widely used {{industry}} standards are chemical <b>table</b> <b>file</b> formats, like the Structure Data Format (SDF) files.

5000|$|The MFT {{structure}} supports algorithms which minimize disk fragmentation.

50|$|While the {{original}} DIGDAT {{program has been}} left relatively untouched, {{there has been a}} new front-end created that will allow the user to name the input file with something more significant than FOR005.DAT. The new input file format allows the user to place comments in the input file. There have also been hooks placed in the DIGDAT that allow for alternate outputs in addition to {{the original}} output format, which is 132 columns wide and slightly user abusive if you intend to import the data into another application.

5000|$|... exFAT and {{the rest}} of the FAT family of file systems does not use indexes for file names, unlike NTFS which uses B-trees for file searching. When a file is accessed, the {{directory}} must be sequentially searched until a match is found. For file names shorter than 16 characters in length, one file name record is required but the entire file is represented by three 32-byte directory records. This is called a directory file set, and a 256 MiB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease but this is the maximum based on the minimum three-record file set.) To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase <b>table</b> (<b>file</b> names are case insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2 byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file. This significantly reduces the CPU cycles because most file names are more than 2 characters (bytes) in size and virtually every comparison is performed on only 2 bytes at a time until the intended file is located.|$|E
50|$|The Job <b>File</b> <b>Table</b> (JFT) is a DOS data {{structure}} in the Program Segment Prefix (PSP). It starts at PSP offset 0x18 and is 20 bytes long. For each open file handle, DOS stores the index into the System <b>File</b> <b>Table</b> (SFT). A <b>file</b> handle that is returned by open, _open and other similar functions is simply an index into the JFT where DOS stored the SFT entry index for the file or device that the program opened.|$|R
