50|$|After the {{pumping station}} at the shore was {{finished}} in 1838 Persius designed and built up-to-date greenhouses and an orangery in 1839. The buildings were erected {{to the west of}} the coach house at the edge of the pleasure ground where three little <b>greenhouses</b> stood previously. <b>The</b> arcade of the orangery referred to the adjacent coach house. <b>The</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> flanked by little water towers, were aligned to the south at the southern gable end of the orangery. Figs, peaches, pineapple, prunes and strawberries were grown in <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses.</b> <b>The</b> area in front of <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> was used for extensive seedbeds. Orangery and one part of <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> were demolished in 1940 and reconstructed in 1981.|$|R

5|$|Paleoclimatology, {{although}} sometimes {{treated as}} part of paleoecology, focuses more {{on the history of}} Earth's climate and the mechanisms that have changed it – which have sometimes included evolutionary developments, for example the rapid expansion of land plants in the Devonian period removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect and thus helping to cause an ice age in the Carboniferous period.|$|E
50|$|Gouda was a {{separate}} refugee camp. In Gouda, refugees were first housed in private homes, {{but at the}} end of October 1914 they were concentrated in vacant <b>greenhouses</b> at <b>the</b> Steensma nursery. As <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> offered insufficient comfort for so many people, a temporary village was built on the front of <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> including a church, a school and a hospital. Behind <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> was a village of 64 wooden houses in which approximately 350 people were accommodated. Other camps consisted of tents or barracks with living and sleeping areas.|$|R
40|$|Growth {{conditions}} {{in a narrow}} bay, low roof Dutch greenhouse (Venlo type) and in a wide bay, high roof Israeli greenhouse (Sharsheret type), were studied. Roof-cover materials that were tested in <b>the</b> Israeli <b>greenhouses</b> included glass, polyethylene, corrugated fiberglass and tabular polycarbonate. The differences in climatic conditions between <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> were usually small and without a specific trend. Day temperatures in all building types were 1 - 6 ℃ higher than the values measured outdoors simultaneously. During most of the season, excessively high temperatures could be avoided by opening ventilation windows. In <b>the</b> Dutch <b>greenhouse,</b> day temperature control was rather limited. Night temperatures in all greenhouses were usually higher by 1 ℃ or less than the outside temperature. In <b>the</b> polycarbonate-covered <b>greenhouse,</b> night temperatures were higher. Radiation inside <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> was about 55 %- 60 % of the outside level. In <b>the</b> polycarbonate-covered <b>greenhouse,</b> radiation levels were about 10 % lower than the others.

5|$|Rounding a corner, {{they see}} a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits {{on top of the}} basket for five hours, {{trapping}} the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse,</b> then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for <b>the</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to <b>the</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{began his}} garden work {{at an early}} age, as a garden boy for the Marquess of Waterford at Curraghmore, County Waterford. From there, {{he went to the}} estate of an Irish baronet in Ballykilcavan, County Laois, Sir Hunt Johnson-Walsh, and was put in charge {{of a large number of}} {{greenhouses}} at the age of 21. According to one account, as the result of a bitter quarrel, one cold winter night in 1861 he let the fires go out, killing many valuable plants. Other accounts consider the story to be a gross exaggeration. Whether in haste after <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> incident or not, Robinson left for Dublin in 1861, where the influence of David Moore, head of the botanical garden at Glasnevin, a family friend, helped him find work at the Botanical Gardens of Regent's Park, London, where he was given responsibility for the hardy herbaceous plants, specialising in British wildflowers.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or {{in small}} groups, or may {{take the form of}} spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. <b>The</b> <b>greenhouse</b> frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female.|$|E
