5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not.

He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis.

25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is.
