25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> tell the two apart {{is to put}} them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E

On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get more male warriors {{would have been to}} have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E

The divisional {{artillery}} had been reorganised, with the medium and heavy guns participating in conventional artillery bombardments {{and the three}} battalions of Field Artillery Regiment 183 being divided between the three infantry regiments. Each infantry regiment received two assault batteries and a platoon of Reserve Engineer Battalion 16, to provide observed and direct fire. Training in the new role led to infantry companies being reorganised and new specialisms being introduced. The three platoons in each company became a rifle section, an assault group, a grenade-launcher troop and a light machine-gun section.

2500|$|The precise {{number of}} creole {{languages}} is not known, particularly as many are poorly attested or documented, but {{the list of}} creole languages shows that creoles exist around the world. About one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500.

With the improvements in ship-building and navigation, traders {{had to learn to}} communicate with people around the world, and <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do this was to develop a pidgin, or simplified language suited to the purpose; in turn, full creole languages developed from these pidgins.

The Middle English creole hypothesis argues that English is itself a creole. If so, this would make it the creole with the largest number of speakers. If this hypothesis is untrue, the creole with the largest number of speakers is Haitian Creole, with almost ten million native speakers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of slavery {{was one of}} the burning issues of the day, and one that often put Wilbur Fisk at odds with many of his fellow Methodists. [...] He was a colonizationist who favored sending America's slaves to Africa. [...] He opposed the abolitionists within the church who sought to deny membership to any slaveholder or any supporter of slavery. [...] Wilbur felt that the abolitionist approach would split the church and prevent those who needed Christian love and teachings the most from receiving it. [...] He endorsed what he believed was a truly Christian, non-violent way of solving this social evil. Many felt his approach would not bring about emancipation. [...] Toward {{the end of his life}} he regretted some of his arguments, but still stood on the principle that a unified church was <b>the</b> <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> emancipate slaves. [...] Whether his way would have worked is open to debate, however, in one sense he was correct—in 1844 the Methodist church did split along exactly the lines that he predicted, and only twenty years after his death the nation was plunged into war as the time for talking about slavery ended.|$|E

40|$|Home {{builders}} are cutting costs and {{people to get}} their balance sheets back in order during the current downturn in the nation’s housing market. The remaining staff still needs to build quality homes on time and on budget. There are scheduling software solutions available to help keep builders on track and automate much of the communication. However, since IT spending is also being cut, how can builders consider buying scheduling software? Implications: Cutting people and IT will affect the productivity of the builder. The risks to doing so are too important to ignore: • Cuts to IT products and services could be crucial and may impact performance • The less IT automation, the less savings on overall expenses • Fewer resources trickle down to other problems like loss of time, unreliable schedules, construction errors and eventually lost profits. Business management’s decision to reduce IT spending should be resisted. Any businesses with well-targeted IT investments outperform their peers by 2 - 5 % of gross profit.
