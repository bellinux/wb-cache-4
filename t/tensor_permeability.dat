50|$|During the fifties, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} {{of interest in the}} Cherenkov effect both in its experimental and theoretical aspects. Professor Majumdar was fascinated by the problem, because it was perhaps the only classical electrodynamical derivation that fetched Nobel prizes in a world dominated by the Quantum. As was usual with him, he approached the problem in an absolutely novel way. Instead of studying the Cherenkov radiation field in the rest frame of the medium through which the charged particle whizzes by, he decided to jump to the rest frame of the charge. The great advantage of this approach is that the electromagnetic field becomes static and can be described by just two scalar potentials, which was a totally new formulation of the problem. However, the flowing medium now acquires a complicated magneto-electric character. This however came as a blessing in disguise, because it led to a discovery in the electrodynamics of crystalline media. Majumdar found that a most general doubly anisotropic medium with tensor permittivity and <b>tensor</b> <b>permeability</b> with non-parallel principal axes could sometimes behave like an 'isotropic' or 'uniaxial' medium as far as the structure of the Fresnel wave surface is concerned. Armed with this insight and his new formulation of the problem, he derived, for the first time, a closed expression for the Cherenkov output in a biaxial crystal in terms of elliptic functions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStandard {{reservoir}} simulation schemes employ {{first order}} upwind schemes for approximation of the convective fluxes when multiple phases or components are present. These convective flux schemes rely upon upwind {{information that is}} determined according to grid geometry. As a consequence directional diffusion is introduced into the solution that is grid dependent. The effect can be particularly important for cases where the flow is across grid coordinate lines and is known as cross-wind diffusion. Truly higher dimensional upwind schemes that minimize cross-wind diffusion are presented for convective flow approximation on quadrilateral unstructured grids. The schemes are locally conservative and yield improved results that are essentially free of spurious oscillations. The higher dimensional schemes are coupled with full tensor Darcy flux approximations. The benefits of the resulting schemes are demonstrated for classical test problems in reservoir simulation including cases with full <b>tensor</b> <b>permeability</b> fields. The test cases involve a range of structured and unstructured grids with variations in orientation and permeability that lead to flow fields that are poorly resolved by standard simulation methods. The higher dimensional formulations are shown to effectively reduce the numerical cross-wind diffusion effect, leading to improved resolution of concentration and saturation fronts...|$|E
40|$|Determining the {{pressure}} differential {{required to achieve}} a desired flow rate in a porous medium requires solving Darcy's law, a Laplace-like equation, with a spatially varying <b>tensor</b> <b>permeability.</b> In various scenarios, the permeability coefficient is sampled at high spatial resolution, which makes solving Darcy's equation numerically prohibitively expensive. As a consequence, much effort has gone into creating upscaled or low-resolution effective models of the coefficient while ensuring that the estimated flow rate is well reproduced, bringing to fore the classic tradeoff between computational cost and numerical accuracy. Here we perform a statistical study to characterize the relative success of upscaling methods on a large sample of permeability coefficients that are above the percolation threshold. We introduce a new technique based on Mode-Elimination Renormalization-Group theory (MG) to build coarse-scale permeability coefficients. Comparing the results with coefficients upscaled using other methods, we find that MG is consistently more accurate, particularly so due to its ability to address the tensorial nature of the coefficients. MG places a low computational demand, in the manner that we have implemented it, and accurate flow-rate estimates are obtained when using MG-upscaled permeabilities that approach or are beyond the percolation threshold.

(1948; Johnson and Breston 1951) {{analyzed}} {{a series}} of oil well cores by cutting them into small horizontal plugs and observed that the permeability varies with {{the direction in which}} the plug is cut. Compared with the theory of Darcy for isotropy porous media, an extension for anisotropic media has been developed by Ferrandon (1948) upon theoretical grounds, in which permeability is represented as a symmetric tensor. Based on the study of Johnson et al. (1948; Johnson and Breston 1951) and Ferrandon’s theory (1948), Scheidegger (1954) obtained the substantiation of the tensor theory. Liakopoulos (1960, 1965 a, b) described the permeability in homogenous anisotropic soils by a second rank, symmetric, positive definite tensor. Chapuis (1989) studied how densification influences the anisotropy of sands and sedimentary rocks by laboratory test method, and found the anisotropy of sandstone increases with densification. Leung (1986) presented the physical and mathematical interpretation for the cross terms in the Cartesian 2 D permeability tensor. Marcus (1962) and Parsons (1964) studied the laboratory results of directional permeability, and concluded that the directional permeability value of a sample is an apparent value depending on the L/W ratio (length/width) of the sample. Masland et al. (1955), Greenkorn et al. (1964) and Asadi et al. (2000) studied anisotropic permeability by laboratory test method, and measurement model of the principal permeabilities of anisotropic media is developed, but the calculation of anisotropic permeability tensor is not given. Based on the laboratory test method of Asadi (Asadi 2000), Ma et al.

This study is carried on two-dimensional synthetic, isotropic or anisotropic, porous media, that are chosen to illustrate the various difficulties mentioned above. A new method is proposed which consists in embedding the porous medium in question in a homogenized one.

40|$|Anisotropy of {{hydraulic}} {{properties of}} subsurface geologic formations {{is an essential}} feature that has been established {{as a consequence of}} the different geologic processes that they undergo during the longer geologic time scale. With respect to petroleum reservoirs, in many cases, anisotropy plays significant role in dictating the direction of flow that becomes no longer dependent only on the pressure gradient direction but also on the principal directions of anisotropy. Furthermore, in complex systems involving the flow of multiphase fluids in which the gravity and the capillarity play an important role, anisotropy can also have important influences. Therefore, there has been great deal of motivation to consider anisotropy when solving the governing conservation laws numerically. Unfortunately, the two-point flux approximation of finite difference approach is not capable of handling full <b>tensor</b> <b>permeability</b> fields. Lately, however, it has been possible to adapt the multipoint flux approximation that can handle anisotropy to the framework of finite difference schemes. In multipoint flux approximation method, the stencil of approximation is more involved, i. e., it requires the involvement of 9 -point stencil for the 2 -D model and 27 -point stencil for the 3 -D model. This is apparently challenging and cumbersome when making the global system of equations. In this work, we apply the equation-type approach, which is the experimenting pressure field approach that enables the solution of the global problem breaks into the solution of multitude of local problems that significantly reduce the complexity without affecting the accuracy of numerical solution. This approach also leads in reducing the computational cost during the simulation. We have applied this technique to a variety of anisotropy scenarios of 3 -D subsurface flow problems and the numerical results demonstrate that the experimenting pressure field technique fits very well with the multipoint flux approximation method. Furthermore, the numerical results explicitly emphasize that anisotropy could not be ignored for the proper model of subsurface flow...|$|E
