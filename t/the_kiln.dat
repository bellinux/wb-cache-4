5|$|In 1955, the Aldermaston Pottery was {{established}} {{on the main}} street by studio potters Alan Caiger-Smith and Geoffrey Eastop. The pottery was renowned for tin-glazed and porcelain wares, which used scrap wood from the Village Farm woodyard to fire <b>the</b> <b>kiln.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{result is}} a ceramic that is mainly {{composed}} of silica and alumina, with other ingredients such as quartz sand. The porosity of the brick depends on the materials and on the firing temperature and duration. The bricks may vary in color depending {{on the amount of}} iron and calcium carbonate in the materials used, and the amount of oxygen in <b>the</b> <b>kiln.</b>|$|E
5|$|Excavation of {{the site}} began in 1971, and became the largest {{to be carried out}} by modern methods on any European monastic site. It {{revealed}} the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> where the tiles were fired; a bell casting pit used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kilns</b> is {{currently}} {{owned and operated}} by the C.S. Lewis Foundation, who runs it as the Study Centre at <b>the</b> <b>Kilns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>kilns,</b> {{consisting}} of masonry walls and hearths, are constructed abutting each other forming a D-shaped plan, with <b>the</b> northern <b>kiln</b> constructed of porphyry {{and the southern}} of brick. The Pine Lodge garage has been constructed {{at the top of}} the embankment, with the rear of the structure surmounting <b>the</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wamono chaire are {{classified}} by <b>the</b> names of <b>kilns</b> (production centers) and potters. <b>The</b> <b>kilns</b> in Seto, {{in the old}} province of Owari (present Aichi Prefecture), are considered <b>the</b> original Japanese <b>kilns</b> to produce chaire, and so traditionally the chaire from <b>the</b> Seto <b>kilns</b> do not fall into the category called kuniyakimono or [...] "provincial ware". Also, <b>the</b> various <b>kilns</b> in Kyoto are not regarded as [...] "provincial ware".|$|R
5|$|Probably {{the best}} known of Favre's {{descendants}} is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre, who descends from Simon and Pisiskiokonay's blessing by her father, Frenchi Maytubby, through their son Alex book who married Cuna -daughter of Pushmataha.

5|$|In {{the farming}} village Nakanogō, {{on the shore}} of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province in the late 16th century, Genjurō, a potter, takes his wares to nearby Ōmizo. He is {{accompanied}} by Tōbei, who dreams of becoming a samurai. A respected sage tells Genjurō's wife Miyagi to warn her husband about seeking profit in times of upheaval, and to prepare for a probable attack on the village. Genjurō arrives with wide profits, but she asks him to stop. Genjurō nevertheless works long hours to finish his pottery. That night, Shibata Katsuie's army sweeps through Nakanogō, and Genjurō, Tōbei and their wives are uprooted. Genjurō collects his pottery from <b>the</b> <b>kiln,</b> and decides to take the pots to a different marketplace. As the two couples travel across a lake, a boat appears from thick fog. The sole passenger tells them he was attacked by pirates, warns them back to their homes, then dies. The two men decide to return their wives to the shore. Tōbei's wife Ohama refuses to go. Miyagi begs Genjurō not to leave her, but is left on the shore with their young son, Gen'ichi, clasped to her back. At market, Genjurō's pottery sells well. After taking his promised share of the profits, Tōbei runs off to buy samurai armor, and sneaks into the ranks of a clan of samurai. Lost from her companions, Ohama has wandered beyond Nagahama in her desperate search for Tōbei. She is raped by a group of soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Conventional wood dry kilns (Rasmussen, 1988) {{are either}} package-type (sideloader) or track-type (tram) construction. Most {{hardwood}} lumber kilns are sideloader kilns in which fork trucks {{are used to}} load lumber packages into <b>the</b> <b>kiln.</b> Most softwood lumber kilns are track types in which lumber packages are loaded on kiln/track cars for loading <b>the</b> <b>kiln.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Tybo Charcoal <b>Kilns</b> are {{a pair of}} {{charcoal}} kilns located 4 mi north of Tybo, Nevada. Both kilns are 30 ft tall and 25 ft in diameter and were built from rocks and mud. <b>The</b> <b>kilns</b> each have three openings: a top opening, a door at ground level, and a rear window with a ramp for wood wagons. <b>The</b> <b>kilns</b> were among 15 built in 1874 for the Tybo Consolidated Company. The company, which mined the region's silver, used charcoal to fuel its smelting furnace. To acquire its fuel, it imported wood from nearby hills, which it then converted to charcoal in <b>the</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1921, Champion {{founded the}} Flint Faience Tile Company in a {{building}} adjacent to the Harriet Street factory, firing decorative tiles in <b>the</b> same <b>kilns</b> as spark plugs. This was done so they could avoid shutting down <b>the</b> <b>kilns</b> when they were finished with spark plug production, because repeated cycles of cooling and reheating would damage <b>the</b> <b>kilns.</b> When AC expanded its operations to the former Dort Motor complex, Flint Faience {{moved to a new}} building there. The northwest portion of the plant still has these tiles along the outside, visible from Dort Highway and Davison Road. In 1933, General Motors closed the tile operation because of increased demand on <b>the</b> <b>kilns</b> for spark plugs.|$|R
25|$|At {{temperatures}} above 550°C {{the equilibrium}} CO2 pressure begins {{to exceed the}} CO2 pressure in air. So above 550°C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO2 into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of CO2 will be much higher {{than it is in}} air. Indeed, if all the oxygen in <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO2 in <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> can be as high as 20 kPa.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>kiln</b> must {{be raised}} to the precise {{temperature}} where the piece will vitrify, but no higher or the piece will sag and deform.|$|E
25|$|In addition, any {{fluctuations}} in packing density in the compact {{as it is}} prepared for <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding heterogeneous densification.|$|E
50|$|The Hurstville Land and Development Company {{bought the}} town and 500 acre of land in 1979. <b>The</b> <b>kilns</b> were {{restored}} by the Jackson County Historical Society in the 1980s. The Jackson County Conservation Board operates an interpretive center near <b>the</b> <b>kilns.</b> It {{is part of the}} Silos & Smokestacks National Heritage Area.|$|R

5000|$|Hurstville was an {{industrial}} complex and a company town. It {{was a major}} lime supplier {{in the state of}} Iowa for masonry building and bridge construction in the Midwest. [...] Alfred Hurst built <b>the</b> first <b>kiln</b> in 1871, and the other three followed soon after. The whole operation grew to include 3000 acre and 50 employees. The property included timber, which was used in <b>the</b> <b>kilns.</b> Hurst organized <b>the</b> Maquoketa and Hurstville Railroad in 1888 to ship the burned lime instead of hauling it by wagon. The limestone was quarried to the east of <b>the</b> <b>kilns</b> across <b>the</b> North Fork of the Maquoketa River. It was brought to <b>the</b> <b>kilns</b> by way of a narrow-gauge railway. A bridge, which collapsed into the river in the 1970s, was built over the river around 1900. By the 1920s the increased use of Portland cement by the construction industry affected the lime industry. The last time all four kilns were used at the same time was 1920, and <b>the</b> <b>kilns</b> were shut down in 1930 when William Hurst, Alfred's son, died.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> {{was used}} as a garage and store (see photographs) and was a {{community}} in its own right, known as Annery Kiln.|$|E
25|$|Phase Three: Re-oxidizing. Oxygen is then {{released}} back into <b>the</b> <b>kiln,</b> causing the coarser material to turn red and the smother silica-laden slip to remain black.|$|E
25|$|The {{lime kiln}} complex {{comprised}} <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> itself, a pond for slaking the calcium oxide from <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> {{to produce the}} slaked lime, hydrated lime, or pickling lime. Several cottages were built nearby for the lime-burners, shipbuilders and blacksmiths, etc. and storage buildings. The main set of cottages are neither evidenced on any maps nor in census returns until after 1851, indicating {{that they were not}} built until later and only one census return in the 19th century lists a lime-kiln worker. A small wharf on the river allowed for the unloading of sailing barges.|$|E
50|$|There {{are a lot}} {{of brick}} {{factories}} located in Imadol. However, with the settlements increasing near <b>the</b> brick <b>kilns,</b> <b>the</b> government has ordered <b>the</b> <b>kilns</b> to shift outside the Kathmandu Valley by the end of 2016. Currently, the bricks are supplied to the construction sites as ordered by the customers.|$|R
25|$|Bricks {{were the}} usual {{material}} for building <b>the</b> <b>kilns.</b> Stone was also used.|$|R

25|$|The {{purpose of}} an oast is to dry hops. This is {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} a flow of heated air through <b>the</b> <b>kiln,</b> rather than a firing process.|$|E
25|$|Phase Two: Reducing. The shutter in <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> is closed, {{reducing}} the amount of oxygen the pottery receives, this causes both the slip and pot to turn black.|$|E
25|$|According {{to sources}} at the time, {{the trade in}} large native Ruson-tsukuri (literally Luzon made in Japanese: or 呂宋つくり) clay jars used for storing green tea and rice wine with Japan flourished in the 12th century, and local Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinense potters had marked each jar with Baybayin letters {{denoting}} the particular urn used and <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> the jars were manufactured in. Certain kilns were renowned over others and prices depended on the reputation of <b>the</b> <b>kiln.</b> Of this flourishing trade, the Burnay jars of Ilocos are the only large clay jar manufactured in Luzon today with origins from this time.|$|E

25|$|Annery limekiln has a ramp {{facing the}} river, three kilns (or burning 'pots'), seven {{entrance}} doorways and nine lower apertures {{for the removal}} of the calcined limestone. The arrangement of the kilns gives an L-shaped compact structure. Some of the entrances led to arched lobbies or 'eyes', at the back of which were the grates and separate 'poking holes' to insert metals rods for 'working' the charge and helping with aeration. A 'lean-to' slated roof may have slotted beneath part of the drip course of projecting stones, which runs around the exterior walls of <b>the</b> <b>kiln.</b> The arched entrances to <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> allowed for the sheltered and safe collection of the quicklime, which reacted violently to water.|$|E
25|$|Dogtown Pottery was {{a master}} potter's shop. His name was John Kostelic. He left to retire to Idaho in 1996. It was then {{purchased}} by a gentleman that opened an artist's retreat in the same area, and provided the use of <b>the</b> <b>kiln</b> and workshop.|$|E
