5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of symbols}} of the U.S. state of Maryland. The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> list are officially recognized symbols created by an act of the Maryland General Assembly and signed into law by the governor. However, two of the more famous symbols of Maryland, the state motto and the state nicknames, were never made official by the state government. While the state seal derives from the colonial heritage of the state, the majority of official state symbols were designated in the last few decades.|$|E
5|$|The Liudhard medalet is a gold Anglo-Saxon coin {{or small}} medal found {{some time before}} 1844 near St Martin's Church in Canterbury, England. It {{was part of the}} Canterbury-St Martin's hoard of six items. The coin, along with other items found with it, now resides in the World Museum Liverpool. Although some {{scholarly}} debate exists on whether or not all <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hoard were from the same grave, most historians who have studied the object conclude that they were buried together as a necklace in a 6th-century woman's grave. The coin is set in a mount so that it could be worn as jewellery, and has an inscription on the obverse or front surrounding a robed figure. The inscription refers to Liudhard, a bishop who accompanied Bertha to England when she married Æthelberht the king of Kent. The reverse side of the coin has a double-barred cross, or patriarchal cross, with more lettering.|$|E

The player may select any of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.|$|E

25|$|Mulch is a kleptomaniac, {{criminal}} dwarf who {{has been}} involved in crime for about 300 years. When considered with the average Dwarf life span he is not that old, making him nice and spry, a good advantage for a criminal. He once was a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (in other words, humans) suited him much better. Because he has stolen from 'Mud Men' Mulch no longer has any significant magic powers of the usual fairy, however he has retained the gift of tongues, and has even shown his ability to speak 'American Dog' in The Arctic Incident. He insists that humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that he is simply taking them back or repossessing <b>the</b> <b>items.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early books, he assisted the LEP against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. But eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with The People on many adventures, acting as a LEP helper at the beginning of The Time Paradox.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

500|$|Marcel {{provided}} Warren with a filming slot on {{the wooded}} backlot of Shepperton Studios, {{located on the}} River Ash. Several scenes feature a bridge that had previously appeared in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965). In addition, production designer Hayden Pearce secured {{the use of the}} manor house in Littleton Park (the studios' original site) to serve as the location of Jessica and Jo's country home. Of the filming arrangements, Warren comments: [...] "This really was quite a unique situation because ... here we were in a studio looking at a real house and real rooms as if shooting on location." [...] The crew were permitted to redecorate the rooms as necessary and, to this end, make use of any of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studios' prop store. Warren states that this resulted in a [...] "crazy" [...] mixture of decors that [...] "certainly helped create the right atmosphere" [...] for the film.|$|E
500|$|Tessa's biographer L.C. Carr later {{commented that}} together, the Wheelers [...] "professionalized the London Museum". Wheeler {{expressed}} his {{opinion that the}} museum [...] "had to be cleaned, expurgated, and catalogued; in general, turned from a junk shop into a tolerably rational institution". Focusing on reorganising the exhibits and developing a more efficient method of cataloguing the artefacts, he also authored A Short Guide to the Collections, before using <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> museum to write three books: London and the Vikings, London and the Saxons, and London and the Romans. Upon his arrival, the Treasury allocated the museum {{an annual budget of}} £5,000, which Wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs. In 1930, Wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget, as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers, publications, and acquisitions, as well as a {{rise in the number of}} educational projects. With this additional funding, he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to £900.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary record}} {{of the church is}} in 1180, when it was a chapel of ease to St Gregory's church. [...] The church was built in three stages, beginning with the first two bays of the chancel and the base of the tower in about 1330–48. [...] The later stages of building were in about 1360, and in about 1425–50. [...] In 1643, during the Civil War, the iconoclast William Dowsing damaged many of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church. [...] A restoration took place in 1685, which included some alterations to the nave roof. [...] A clock was installed in 1701, and {{during the first half of}} the 18thcentury a spire of metal and wood was added; this was replaced by another spire in 1810. [...] The church was restored again in 1858–59 by William Butterfield; this included removal of the three galleries and the box pews, re-laying the chancel floor, and replacement of the pulpit. [...] Stained glass made by Hardman & Co. was installed in some of the windows, and more stained glass by Hardman was installed later in the century.|$|E
