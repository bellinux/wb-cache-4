2500|$|Determining which {{fracking}} {{technique is}} appropriate for well productivity depends largely on {{the properties of the}} reservoir rock from which to extract oil or gas. [...] If the rock is characterized by low-permeability — which refers to its ability to let substances, i.e. gas, pass through it, then the rock may be considered a source of <b>tight</b> <b>gas.</b> [...] Fracking for shale gas, which is currently also known as a source of unconventional gas, involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation, at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally. [...] In contrast, conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability, which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> has required. The decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production has not only improved access to natural gas in low-permeability reservoir rocks, but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health.|$|E
30|$|Given the {{considerable}} resource potential of <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas,</b> {{a series of}} studies have focused on development conditions, accumulation mechanisms, and type classifications. Accumulation mechanisms involving relative permeability sealing, diagenesis sealing, force balance sealing, and lateral fault sealing have been proposed (Masters 1979; Gies 1984; Jiang et al. 2000, 2006; Pang et al. 2003; Jin et al. 2003). However, accumulation controlling factors, modes, and mechanisms of <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas</b> are poorly understood. Based on a review of previous studies of <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas</b> and through a detailed case study of typical <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas</b> reservoirs found in China, this paper discusses accumulation mechanisms, type classifications, accumulation controlling factors, development modes, and resource potential of <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas.</b> Such efforts will {{play a significant role in}} enriching natural gas geological theories and in advancing the exploration and development of <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas.</b>|$|R

[...] The inventory is incomplete due to exclusion of tight {{oil and gas}} from sources other than shale such as sandstone or carbonates, formations underlying the large oil fields located in the Middle East and the Caspian region, off shore formations, or about which there is little information. Estimated technically recoverable shale oil resources total 335 to 345 billion barrels.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tight</b> <b>gas</b> is gas in low-permeability rock. Reservoirs require {{artificial}} fracturing {{to enable the}} gas to flow. Canadian Hunter Exploration in the 1970s identified a huge gas resource in the Deep Basin of western Alberta. In this area, much of the sedimentary section is charged with natural gas. [...] The rock can have extremely low permeability but production is not hampered {{by the presence of}} water. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are techniques used to develop such resources. Similar gas-charged areas have been found {{in many parts of the}} world; a common term for this kind of reservoir is [...] "basin-centred gas".

30|$|For <b>tight</b> {{sandstone}} <b>gas</b> reservoirs, coal source {{rocks are}} characterized by wide distribution, high TOC, and high hydrocarbon-generating intensity. The results of hydrocarbon generation simulation experiments show that coal can continuously generate and expel hydrocarbon while charging reservoirs with no gas generation peak level, even during highly thermal evolution stages. The Sulige gas field of the Ordos Basin, gas fields in the western Sichuan Depression of the Sichuan Basin and <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas</b> reservoirs in the Kuqa Depression of the Tarim Basin are primarily associated with coal strata, which can indeed generate continuous and abundant natural gas. This period of large-scale gas generation has been relatively late and considerably long (it still continues), thus facilitating the formation of <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas</b> reservoirs (Zou et al. 2011 a; Li et al. 2012).|$|R

30|$|Recently, {{multilayered}} <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas</b> reservoirs {{are gradually}} playing a {{more and more}} {{significant role in the}} oil and gas exploration and development from northeast China.

Therefore, hydraulic fracturing stimulation is necessary for economically increase the recoverable reserves underground. General fracturing and separate layer fracturing techniques are the prevalent methods for developing multilayered <b>tight</b> sandstone <b>gas</b> reservoirs; thus, investigation of the fracture configurations under these treatments should be carried out for increasing the success rate during operation.|$|R
