While this type of satire became more common as people imitated Swift, later, Swift is quite unusual in offering the readers no way out. He does not persuade to any position, but he does persuade readers from an assortment of positions. This {{is one of the}} qualities <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Tale Swift's least-read major work.|$|E
25|$|PA 61 enters Conyngham Township in Columbia County {{and heads}} {{northeast}} through dense forests as an unnamed four-lane undivided road. Farther northeast, the route narrows to a three lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 61 curves east and becomes two-lane undivided Byrnesville Road, which is designated SR 2002. The former divided highway alignment of PA 61 past this point {{has been closed}} because of the Centralia mine fire <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> road unsafe to travel on. The closed section of the road is used by pedestrians and bicyclists and is covered in graffiti. PA 61 follows Byrnesville Road northeast through forests before passing through the abandoned community of Byrnesville. The route curves northwest through more woods and rejoins the closed alignment, at which point SR 2002 ends. At this point, PA 61 enters the borough of Centralia, which has largely been abandoned because of the mine fire, as two-lane undivided Locust Avenue. The road runs north through abandoned areas of the borough which have been overgrown with trees. PA 61 turns west onto West Centre Street, with PA 42 continuing north along Locust Avenue. From here, the route heads west through more abandoned sections of Centralia. The road leaves Centralia for Conyngham Township again and becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading through forested areas and passing {{to the south of}} a large coal mine.|$|E

Also for The Hindu, Malathi Rangarajan wrote, [...] "Let's celebrate the figment of [...] imagination <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> housefly appear as invincible as any of our muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of The Telegraph called the film [...] "a winner from the first frame to the last" [...] and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made [...] "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept anything that he throws at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called Eega the [...] "best, most insane, most inventive film of the year", and praised Rajamouli's scripting, the visual effects and Sudeep's performance, calling the latter [...] "legitimately hilarious". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave Eega four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was [...] "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from Sify called Eega an [...] "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" [...] that [...] "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".|$|E
500|$|Tonight {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The album has a total score of 70/100 on Metacritic, based on 32 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". It {{did not receive}} the amount of critical acclaim their first two studio albums received. Critics often praised the album's sound and the instrumentation of the songs on the album. The album's sound was also subject to criticism by some critics, {{as well as the}} lyrics and album production. Clash magazine commented that it could be [...] "the band's most complete work to date. Worth the wait, and in all honesty better than we could ever have hoped for." [...] The Financial Post states that [...] "Tonight is the band's best album: Paradoxically, they've allowed themselves a degree of release from their characteristic tension by creating structures within which they can cut loose." [...] The Telegraph commented on how Tonight: Franz Ferdinand is a melody-packed re-affirmation of everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> band so popular hitherto, but with a highly contemporary-sounding, keyboard-driven edge. The Trades stated that [...] "this [...] is an evolutionary step for the band rather than a revolutionary one. Smart and danceable, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand proves that Franz Ferdinand are the masters of dance-rock." [...] NBC commented on how 'Franz Ferdinand has once again managed to outdo themselves with their best album to date.' ...|$|E
500|$|The album's earlier {{sessions}} {{produced a}} little material <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> final cut. West {{had brought a}} majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted {{in the creation of}} My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But you guys are important to push this forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. I would come in with a beat and he'd be like, 'Take this out, slow it down.' It would make it sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat".|$|E

500|$|Campbell's {{plans for}} Unknown {{were laid out}} in the February 1939 issue of Astounding, in the {{announcement}} of the new magazine. He argued that [...] "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> very word anathema ... will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's Sinister Barrier, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as [...] "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy". Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in Ashley's words, Campbell [...] "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy". [...] The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's [...] "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, [...] "Trouble with Water" [...] was a better indication than Sinister Barrier of the direction Unknown would take. [...] Campbell commented in a letter at the time that Sinister Barrier, [...] "Trouble with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{privatization}} {{was carried}} out in stages, beginning with the five largest of the 13 regional water companies serving more than 75% of users. Because of the staging, it is possible to compare the performance of the privatized and public utilities at that time. This comparison shows that from 1998 to 2001 private companies invested substantially more than public companies and - unlike the public companies - increased their labor productivity significantly. Tariffs increased for both types of companies, but more so for the privatized ones. However, according to one study, [...] "in Chile a social consensus emerged <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> higher water rates acceptable given the improvements in service quality and the addition of new services such as wastewater treatment." ...|$|E

Similarly, the Chicago Tribune praised the paper as [...] "one of the few venues in American life that takes ideas seriously. And it pays readers the ultimate compliment of assuming that we do too." [...] In a 2006 New York magazine feature, James Atlas stated: [...] "It's an eclectic but impressive mix [...] <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>The</b> New York Review of Books the premier journal of the American intellectual elite".
