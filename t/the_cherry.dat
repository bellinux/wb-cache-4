50|$|Gerezi beltza arno gorriakin is {{a cherry}} soup served warm or cold. <b>The</b> <b>cherries</b> are poached in wine, often with enough sugar added {{to make a}} light syrup.

Usually the soup is prepared on the day it will be served, because 24 hours is enough time for <b>the</b> <b>cherries</b> to blanch noticeably in the liquid. The soup is often served {{with a dollop of}} sour cream, crème fraîche, or ice cream.|$|R

5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places <b>the</b> <b>cherry</b> tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

5|$|At that intersection, the {{trunkline}} {{meets the}} northern end of M-22, which is running concurrently with M-72 along the parkway. As US31/M-37 turns east to run along the bay north of downtown, the highway merges with M-72 and picks up the LMCT again. Grandview Parkway runs between the Boardman River and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward to run up the Old Mission Peninsula, and US31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. The highway runs north of <b>the</b> <b>Cherry</b> Capital Airport near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to Traverse City State Park. East of the park, the trunkline exits suburban Traverse City and rounds the bay to run northward along its eastern shore. In the community of Acme, M-72 turns eastward while US31 continues north past the Grand Traverse Resort.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> coffee <b>cherries</b> {{are spread}} out in the sun, either on large {{concrete}} or brick patios or on matting raised to waist height on trestles.

5|$|In {{the end of}} 2012, {{and before}} her divorce from Josh Brolin in early 2013, Lane {{returned}} to her theater roots and headlined a production of the David Cromer directed Sweet Bird of Youth (by Tennessee Williams) at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Lane played Princess Kosmonopolis, a fading Hollywood movie star, opposite Finn Wittrock, who portrayed Chance, her attractive gigolo. This {{was the first time}} she had done a stage play since 1989, when she played Olivia in William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Lane returned to theatre in the winter of 2015, starring with Tony Shalhoub in the off-Broadway original production of Bathsheba Doran's The Mystery of Love and Sex. In 2016, nearly four decades after she first appeared on Broadway, Lane starred in a play in which she previously performed: Chekhov's <b>The</b> <b>Cherry</b> Orchard (1977). While Lane played a child peasant (with no lines) in Broadway's 1977 run of the play, this time she played the lead role of Madame Lyubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya.|$|E
5|$|Route 70 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with Route 38 and County Route 601 (CR 601) in Pennsauken Township, Camden County. From this interchange, it {{heads to the}} southeast on Marlton Pike, a six-lane divided highway that runs through suburban residential and commercial areas. The road is also officially called the John Davison Rockefeller Memorial Highway for its entire length after John Davison Rockefeller. The road enters Cherry Hill and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with CR 636 before crossing under New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line, a short distance {{to the south of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cherry</b> Hill Station. In this area, Route 70 passes to the south of the former site of the Garden State Park before crossing CR 644. Past this intersection, the route narrows to four lanes and turns more to as it comes to the Ellisburg area. In Ellisburg, it has an intersection with Route 41 and the northern terminus of Route 154. The road runs through more suburban areas as it encounters Interstate 295 at another cloverleaf interchange. A short distance past I-295, Route 70 passes over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange before widening into an eight-lane highway and continuing east to junctions with CR 674 and CR 673. Following CR 673, the road narrows back to four lanes before it encounters CR 600, a former alignment of the road known as Old Marlton Pike.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accounts}} {{indicate that}} during <b>the</b> <b>Cherry</b> Valley massacre or thereafter, Colonel Stacy was stripped naked and {{tied to a}} stake, {{and was about to}} be tortured and killed, as was the ritual for enemy warriors, but was spared by Joseph Brant. William Stacy was a Freemason; Joseph Brant was an educated American Indian, and had also become a Freemason. It is reported that Stacy made an appeal as one Freemason to another, thus saving his life. Colonel Stacy was subsequently taken to Fort Niagara, the Loyalist base in New York and held prisoner under Colonel Butler during the summer of 1779. At Fort Niagara, Molly Brant, the sister of Joseph Brant, was hostile toward Stacy, and wanted Colonel Butler to return custody of Stacy to the Indians. She proclaimed dreams of her and the Indians using Stacy's head in an Indian football game. Colonel Butler placated Molly Brant with rum and protected his prisoner. Subsequently, from late-1779 through mid-1782, Colonel Stacy was held prisoner at Fort Chambly near Montreal.|$|E
50|$|As {{the main}} {{ancestor}} of <b>the</b> cultivated <b>cherry,</b> <b>the</b> sweet <b>cherry</b> {{is one of}} <b>the</b> two <b>cherry</b> species which supply most of the world's commercial cultivars of edible <b>cherry</b> (<b>the</b> other is <b>the</b> sour <b>cherry</b> Prunus cerasus, mainly used for cooking; a few other species {{have had a very}} small input).
