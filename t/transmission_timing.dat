Especially, the <b>transmission</b> <b>timings</b> of two nodes are recorded, and their transmission rates can be time-varying (piecewise constant). Based on the timing measurements, {{our objective is}} to detect the presence of packet flows between them. Two different scenarios are considered; {{the first is that}} a flow may exist in only one specific direction, and the other is that a flow may exist in any direction. For each case, a detection algorithm is provided, and for the latter scenario, an additional algorithm aimed at estimating the direction of the underlying flow is proposed. When the transmission processes are nonhomogeneous Poisson processes, under certain conditions, our algorithms are proved to be consistent. The algorithms are tested using the MSN Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic and the synthetic Poisson traffic. I...|$|R

40|$|Power {{control is}} one of the {{technologies}} used to utilize the radio resources as efficient as possible in WCDMA. The transmission power is adjusted to transmit with the lowest power level possible while the required received signal quality is maintained. Since there are large variation in channel quality over time, the power has to be adjusted to compensate for these variations. During moments of bad channel conditions a high transmission power has to be used which will to a greater extent interfere with other users in the system. To solve this problem a concept called <b>transmission</b> <b>timing</b> was proposed. The basic idea is that the transmitter avoids data transmission during the short periods of bad channel conditions caused by fast fading. Higher bit rates can be used to compensate for this when the channel conditions are good. In this thesis the performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>timing</b> applied to uplink data transmissions is evaluated. This is accomplished through a theoretical analysis as well as simulations of a cellular system using <b>transmission</b> <b>timing.</b> Lowered transmission power is achieved and thus lowered interference is induced. Simulations showed that the transmission power can be lowered by up to 1. 6 dB compared to ordinary continuous transmission with equal average data rate. These results are however strongly dependent on the used radio environment. It is also showed that <b>transmission</b> <b>timing</b> provides increased system stability in case of rapid changes in the load situation...|$|E

It utilizes channel state {{feedback in the form}} of power control commands, which already are available in the system.
