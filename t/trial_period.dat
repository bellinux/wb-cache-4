5|$|Prior to 1989s release, Swift {{stressed}} the importance of albums to artists and fans. In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In June 2015, Swift criticized Apple Music in an open letter for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month <b>trial</b> <b>period</b> and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog. The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free <b>trial</b> <b>period,</b> and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service. Swift's intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to the singer and the 1989 era memes. She re-added her entire catalog to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play in June 2017.|$|E

5|$|After {{experimentation}} on the Brighton experimental ensemble, Ofcom advertised {{for small}} scale DAB multiplexes to broadcast across the United Kingdom on ten localised multiplexes for a nine-month <b>trial</b> <b>period,</b> then extended {{for an extra}} two years. The trials will test the viability of using free and open source software (FOSS) with low cost equipment to broadcast from a single transmitter, a single frequency network or channel repeaters to allow smaller radio stations to broadcast more cost effectively than is currently possible on local multiplexes.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the early work experiences of low skilled youth {{against the background}} of the recently introduced 90 day <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> legislation. A mixed method research approach was employed to survey young people’s experiences of their early work careers, along with interviews with key stakeholders in the field of youth employment. From a sample of 100 self administered surveys from young people, the research finds that 90 day <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> are not widely used for 15 to 19 year olds. Low incidence of use can be explained by majority of respondents being in part time or casual work. Where respondents were in full time employment <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> are widely used, and {{they are more likely to}} be applied in a formal and long term manner by employers within the construction industry. The research concludes that while 90 day <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> are one mechanism for increasing youth employment, they may not be the most effective as youth unemployment is a complex issue with systemic causes. The factors that contribute to youth unemployment are widespread and could be addressed by increased career advice in schools, a more comprehensive youth transition between school and employment and addressing the skills mismatch with employers needs in the workplace. Addressing these issues may have greater impact on youth unemployment than 90 day <b>trial</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} six months of operation, the subway was {{operated}} as a single system, with trains from Eglinton Station running through to either Keele or Woodbine station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and the practice was abandoned after the initial <b>trial</b> <b>period,</b> leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the political difficulty of enacting welfare-enhancing Pigouvian taxes. Using referenda {{in a market}} experiment with externalities, we investigate the effect of <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> on the acceptability of two theoretically equivalent variants of Pigouvian taxes. While implementing either tax is in subjects’ material self-interest, we find significant levels of opposition to both tax schemes, though the level differs considerably. Results show that trial runs can overcome initial tax aversion, significantly increasing acceptability. The effect is robust across tax schemes, but a trial with one scheme {{does not affect the}} acceptability of the other. <b>Trial</b> <b>periods</b> also mitigate initial biases in preferences of alternative tax schemes...|$|R

5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a <b>trial</b> <b>period</b> of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine.

5|$|Born in Enfield, London, Morison joined Northampton Town {{as part of}} the club's youth system after a {{successful}} <b>trial</b> <b>period</b> with the club, having also spent time on trial at Leicester City. When Morison turned 18, he signed a two-year professional contract with Northampton. He impressed manager Kevan Broadhurst and subsequently made his debut {{at the end of the}} 2001–02 season in a 2–2 draw against Cambridge United. The following season, Morison featured regularly as a substitute, playing a total of 15 games, scoring his first goal for the Northamptonshire side in a 2–2 draw against Plymouth Argyle. However, the 2003–04 season witnessed Morison feature in only 5 games, getting on the scoresheet once. In June 2004, he was offered a new six-month contract at the club, and told by manager Colin Calderwood that he had to prove his worth at the club.|$|E

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{is made of}} the availability of Antarctic synoptic observations on the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Telecommunication System (GTS) during the <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> (5 – 9 July 1993 and 1 – 15 February 1994) and winter and summer special observing periods (SOPs) (July 1994 and January 1995) of the Antarctic First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere project. The data collected at two nodes of the GTS—Melbourne, Australia, and Bracknell, United Kingdom—are considered. Data received at Melbourne were passed on to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Hobart and those received at Bracknell were passed similarly on to Cambridge. The <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> showed that there were large differences in the number of surface observations received at the two nodes. Although Hobart always received more upper-air data than Cambridge, the reverse was true with automatic weather station (AWS) data. The experience from the SOPs indicates that there are now almost 50 % more AWS observations on the GTS than surface observations from the staffed stations...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{release of}} Final Fantasy XIV began development under the codename Rapture between late 2004 and early 2005, and was officially announced in 2009. This version {{was directed by}} Nobuaki Komoto and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, who was also serving as the producer of Final Fantasy XI, and employed the Crystal Tools engine, which had previously been used for Final Fantasy XIII. Following a bug-laden, abbreviated beta test period, the game released in September 2010 to near-universal negative reception. After two extensions to the initial free <b>trial</b> <b>period,</b> then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada issued a formal apology to players and fans in December 2010, and announced a dramatic overhaul in the development team, most prominently the removal of Tanaka from the project and the demotion of Komoto from Director to Lead Designer. Monthly fees for the game were suspended until further notice and the previously planned PlayStation 3 version was canceled. After the change in development team, Naoki Yoshida, who had worked as planning chief of Dragon Quest X, {{was brought in to}} supervise the project as both producer and director.|$|E
5|$|The {{paper was}} {{launched}} {{with an initial}} print-run of 60,000, and was edited by a skeleton staff during the trial run, with plans to employ more journalists if it became a permanent publication.

During the initial week of publication, Walker spoke of his belief that The National would continue beyond the <b>trial</b> <b>period,</b> but said the decision was {{in the hands of}} its publishers. Following healthy sales in the first few days, Newsquest executives decided on 27 November to continue printing the newspaper, and to allocate it additional resources.

Publication then continued on weekdays until the introduction of a Saturday edition in May 2015.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during the six-month <b>trial</b> <b>period.</b> The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the test was extended for three more months, and in October the test was extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the recent}} changes to {{employment}} legislation in New Zealand are working as intended, this report finds. Overview: This report provides a short-term evaluation of the 2010 amendments to the Employment Relations Act 2000 and Holidays Act 2003. The evaluation follows a mixed methods approach, based on qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data, and includes the following key areas of legislative change; 	allowing all employers the option to use <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> 	changes to the Holidays Act (cashing up annual holidays, transferring public holidays, payment for some holidays and leave and providing proof of sickness) 	making union access to workplaces conditional on employer consent, and 	changes in provisions relating to employment problem resolution. For <b>trial</b> <b>periods,</b> some {{of the benefits of}} extending coverage to all businesses identified included reduced risk when hiring new people, greater flexibility, ease and security of use and some cost savings for employers. The report shows that extending the use of <b>trial</b> <b>periods</b> to all employers has resulted in more employment opportunities, with one third of employers surveyed saying the provision has led to them hiring people they otherwise wouldn’t have. For the Holidays Act amendments, benefits included greater flexibility and increased choices for some employers and employees. In some cases the evaluation found that the successful uptake of the changes has been affected by variable levels of understanding and difficulty applying the changes. For example, employers are finding that some Holidays Act provisions are still difficult to apply in some work arrangements, such as for people with variable work hours...|$|R
