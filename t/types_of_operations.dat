25|$|The Fw 190 {{also saw}} heavy {{action in the}} 1944 Normandy Campaign. German fighters flew 760 sorties on 6 June 1944 against an Allied total of 14,000. By 10 June, the dearth of {{specialised}} ground attack aircraft forces meant the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) ordered the Fw 190 Gruppen to install bomb racks for these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> Just 24 hours later, the Fw 190 units were asked to revert to air superiority roles again. With conflicting orders and harried by Allied air forces, losses were heavy. In the space of three weeks, 200 Fw 190s and 100 pilots were lost to enemy action. Total losses {{by the end of}} June 1944 totalled 230 pilots killed and 88 wounded. Among the casualties was the 173-victory Fw 190 ace Emil Lang. 551 German fighters were shot down, with another 65 destroyed on the ground. A further 290 were damaged. In return, German pilots claimed 526 Allied aircraft destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|Jerome Kerviel (Société Générale) and Kweku Adoboli (UBS), two rogue traders, {{worked in}} {{the same type of}} position, the Delta One desk - a table where {{derivatives}} are traded, and not single stocks or bonds. These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> are relatively simple and often reserved for novice traders who also specialize in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), financial products that mimic the performance of an index (i.e. either upward or downward). As they are easy to use, they facilitate portfolio diversification through the acquisition of contracts backed by a stock index or industry (e.g. commodities). The two traders were very familiar to control procedures. They {{worked in the}} back office, the administrative body of the bank that controls the regularity of operations, before moving to trading. According to the report of the Inspector General of Societe Generale, in 2005 and 2006 Kerviel [...] "led" [...] by taking 100 to 150 million-euro positions on the shares of Solarworld AG listed in Germany.

2500|$|Besides {{attempting}} {{to organize a}} strong force of regular Confederate troops, General Hindman used the conscription laws to create home guard units. The Confederate conscription statues required that boys of 17 years and men between 45 and 50 serve in home guard units, similar to the traditional militia. On June 17, 1862 Hindman issued General Order Number Seventeen, providing that [...] "for the more effectual annoyance of the enemy...all citizens of this district, who {{are not subject to}} conscription, are called upon to organize themselves into independent companies." [...] In the thoroughness that typified Hindman, he suggested the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> which the home guards should carry out: [...] "Their duty will be to cut off Federal pickets, scouts, foraging parties, and trains, and to kill pilots and others on gun-boats and transports, attacking them day and night, and using the greatest vigor in their movements." [...] Although the home guard units were similar to the militia, the Federals accused Hindman of legalizing bushwhacking. Many of the men who joined the home guards merely used the organization as an excuse to pillage isolated farms and villages. Northwest Arkansas, in particular, suffered at the hands of these guerilla bands.|$|E
