5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard <b>times</b> <b>like</b> those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
5|$|At the Prom, Chuck foils a plot by Penelope (Amanda Setton), Hazel (Dreama Walker), Isabel (Nicole Fiscella), and Nelly Yuki (Yin Chang) {{to humiliate}} Blair during Prom royalty elections. Chuck admits to Serena and Dan {{that he has}} {{secretly}} been altering Nate and Blair’s Prom night in order to recreate the scenes from Blair's Prom scrapbook. Meanwhile, Blair feels disconcerted while dancing with Nate and ends their relationship {{by the end of}} the night. Blair explains to Serena that after completing high school with Nate, he feels like simply a high school boyfriend. The girls reminisce about growing up together through crazy <b>times,</b> <b>like</b> sisters. Lily apologizes to Rufus and CeCe. Rufus expresses concern that Lily is too unpredictable and too much like her mother. CeCe remains indifferent, but agrees to return to Lily's home.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they serve}} {{alcoholic}} beverages, casino nightclubs {{are prohibited from}} offering full nudity. In 2013, Trump Taj Mahal opened the nation's first casino strip club, featuring scantily clad dancers.

Because Atlantic City has ordinances prohibiting underage drinking on private property, it is illegal for a person underage 21 to drink in a casino hotel room unless a family member is present.|$|E

5|$|Buildings play a {{big role}} in gameplay, as they are used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain <b>times</b> <b>like</b> the defensive towers.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the more}} famous Stanley Cup, members of the winning teams are allowed time to {{celebrate}} with the trophy in their own fashion, often taking it to their home towns or tours in locations across Canada.

The trophy {{is accompanied by a}} designated representative of the Hall of Fame at all <b>times.</b> <b>Like</b> the Stanley Cup, but unlike the Vince Lombardi Trophy, a new trophy is not made every year.|$|E
5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers a {{surveillance}} camera in her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} overwritten numerous <b>times</b> <b>like</b> a palimpsest, to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man with ties to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes. Their work is disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), bleeding from a chest wound.|$|E

25|$|The {{churches have}} symbolized a {{connection}} between Jämtland's population through generations and this is still the case for many today. People are joined together through cheerful moments such as christening, Holy Matrimony, confirmation, through crisis and mournful <b>times</b> <b>like</b> funerals. In Jämtland-Härjedalen the free church movement did not become near as widespread as {{in the rest of}} Sweden. Because of this Jämtland and Härjedalen have a large number of members in the Swedish church since nine out of ten in fact are members. Although nowadays church attendance is much lower, back then every parishioner gathered on the Sabbath because no one was allowed to work. Within each parish distinctive customs, bunads and dialects developed because of this, especially the dialects are known to differ from parish to parish in Jämtland.|$|E

25|$|The {{invasion}} of the Iberian Peninsula in the year 711 by Moors from the Maghreb {{put an end to}} Visigoth rule in Hispania, called Al-Andalus by the newcomers. Moorish presence strongly influenced art and architecture in Portuguese territory, especially in Southern Portugal, where the Reconquista was only finished in 1249. However, in contrast to neighbouring Spain, few Islamic buildings in Portugal have survived intact to this day. Traditional houses in many cities and villages in Portugal have simple, white façades that lend the ensemble of streets and neighbourhoods a distinct Islamic look, similar to that of villages in Northern Africa. Many villages and city neighbourhoods have retained the street layout from Islamic <b>times,</b> <b>like</b> the Alfama in Lisbon. Moorish buildings were often constructed with the rammed earth (taipa) and adobe techniques, followed by whitewashing.|$|E
25|$|The Emperor Charles (reigned 1516 -56) {{continued}} Spanish {{expansion into}} the Netherlands, {{which had its}} Frisian warhorse, noted by Vegetius and used on the continent and in Britain in Roman <b>times.</b> <b>Like</b> the Andalusian, the Frisian bred true to type. Even with infusions of Spanish blood during the sixteenth century, it retained its indigenous characteristics, taking the best from both breeds. The Frisian is mentioned in 16th and 17th century works as a courageous horse eminently suitable for war, lacking the volatility of some breeds or the phlegm of very heavy ones. Generally black, the Frisian was around 15hh with strong, cobby conformation, but with a deal more elegance and quality. The noted gait was a smooth trot coming from powerful quarters. Nowadays, though breed definition is retained, the size has markedly increased, as has that of most breeds due to improved rearing and dietary methods.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Malay music span {{from music}} for various {{theatrical}} forms such as wayang kulit, bangsawan and dance dramas {{as well as}} story-telling, to folk songs and music for dances, royal ceremonies, martial arts (silat), life cycle events, and religious occasions. Many forms of traditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region with influences from India, China, Thailand and Indonesia. The music is based around percussion instruments, {{the most important of}} which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums, including kompang and hadrah drums. Drums and other traditional percussion instruments are often made from natural materials. Besides drums, other percussion instruments (some made of shells) include: the rebab (a bowed string instrument), the serunai (a double-reed oboe-like instrument), the seruling (flute), and trumpets. Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and <b>times</b> <b>like</b> harvest. It was once used as a form of long-distance communication.|$|E

25|$|Pitches in Pakistan have {{historically}} supported spin bowling rather than seam or swing. However, {{the conditions in}} most grounds of Pakistan, like Rawalpindi, Lahore and Peshwar have also seen support for the reverse swing capabilities of the local bowlers in past <b>times</b> <b>like</b> Imran Khan, Sarfraz Nawaz , Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. The dry and windy conditions usually lend good support to the faster bowlers as well. Such pitches had virtually no grass, afforded little assistance for pace, bounce, or lateral air movement, but created good turn. In decades past, legendary offspinners such as Saqlain Mushtaq credited for the doosra, and legspinners such as Abdul Qadir and Mushtaq Ahmed, routinely toyed with visiting teams to plot dramatic victories for Pakistan in home test matches, particularly on turning pitches in hot, humid conditions at Arbab Niaz Stadium and Gaddafi Stadium. Pitches in Pakistan are flat and considered batting paradises for batsmen in winter; they suit spinners in summers.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Romanesque cathedrals were modernised with Gothic elements. Thus, the Romanesque nave of Oporto Cathedral is {{supported}} by flying buttresses, {{one of the first}} built in Portugal (early 13th century). The apse of Lisbon Cathedral was totally remodelled {{in the first half of}} the 14th century, when it gained a Gothic ambulatory illuminated by a clerestory (high row of windows on the upper storey). The ambulatory has a series of radiant chapels illuminated with large windows, contrasting with the dark Romanesque nave of the cathedral. An important transitional building is Évora Cathedral, built during the 13th century; even though its floorplan, façade and elevation are inspired by Lisbon Cathedral, its forms (arches, windows, vaults) are already Gothic. Many Gothic churches maintained the fortress-like appearance of Romanesque <b>times,</b> <b>like</b> the already-mentioned Évora Cathedral, the Church of the Monastery of Leça do Balio (14th century) near Matosinhos, and even as late as the 15th-century, with the Main Church of Viana do Castelo.|$|E
25|$|This temple is {{one among}} the 51 Shakti peethas {{located on the}} Indian subcontinent and is a {{location}} where one of Sati's limbs, her right arm is considered to have fallen when grief-stricken and agitated Shiva was carrying her dead body round the world on his shoulders, and Vishnu had cut her body into pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra. The story behind this event is that King Prajapati Daksha, father of Sati (the first wife of Lord Shiva), was performing a yagna (yagna {{is defined as a}} Hindu fire ritual sacrifice when deities of the Vedic <b>times</b> <b>like</b> Agni, the fire god, and others were invoked by offering oblations such as ghee (clarified butter), milk, grains and so forth) called as Brihaspatirao. Sati (also called Shakti) who was Lord Shiva's wife, attended the function without invitation. Daksha who was not fond of his son-in-law, as he considered him a mendicant, purposely did not invite him for the yagna, while he invited all other gods. Sati felt deeply insulted by the slight shown by her father towards her husband whom she had married out of deep love. Even then she decided to attend the yagna uninvited by her own father. When she went there, her father compounded the insult by totally ignoring her presence and vilifying Shiva. Sati felt deeply humiliated and hurt, and then in frustration she jumped into the yagna fire and committed suicide. When this news was conveyed to Shiva, first he sent his assistant to the site to enquire and take revenge. Shiva also came to the yagna site and created a furor. In a state of grief and anger he put Sati's dead body on his shoulders and started wandering round the universe. Looking at this grave situation, Brahma and Vishnu decided to intervene and bring back Shiva to his normal self. It was then decided that Vishnu will follow behind Shiva, and with his Sudarsha Chakra cut Sati's dead body into pieces. Thus Vishnu cut her into 51 pieces (108 pieces are also mentioned in many Puranic texts) as Shiva traveled around the world and these fifty one body parts of Sati fell at different locations in the subcontinent, and all these places {{came to be known as}} Shakthi Peethas (abode of goddess Shakthi or Durga). Her right arm fell on the Saptashrungi hills and the place became holy, and a Shakthi Peeth came to be established here.|$|E
