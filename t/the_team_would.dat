5|$|They {{performed}} the custom at Christmas time, and usually on Christmas Eve. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> arrive at people's houses {{where they would}} sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with their broom while chasing any girls present. Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols at this point. Upon being presented with payment, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> leave to repeat the process at another house.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, coach Henning {{said that}} Tolliver was to be the starter heading into next season, and that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> not protect Vlasic under Plan B free agency, meaning he could sign with any {{interested}} team. As a result, he began to meet with other teams that were looking for a quarterback, including the Cowboys and Green Bay Packers.|$|E
5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with the first pick at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. The decision was highly controversial as the fans in Montreal had hoped <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> take francophone star Denis Savard. Wickenheiser's transition to the NHL was difficult; his popularity was harmed by comparisons of his struggles to Savard's immediate success with the Black Hawks. He {{was traded to the}} Blues midway through the 1983–84 season.|$|E
500|$|The [...] also {{introduced}} a half-time at which <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> swap ends. Initially {{this was only}} if the game was scoreless as <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> also swap ends if a goal was scored. The rule was changed to a swap at half-time only in 1876.|$|R
50|$|The ties in {{each round}} were played over a single match; {{in the event}} that scores were level after 90 minutes, <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play an {{additional}} 30 minutes of extra time, divided into two 15-minute halves, to determine the winner. If the scores remained level after extra time, <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> contest a penalty shootout.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> next meet in an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final in 2011.|$|R
5|$|Following the Russian Grand Prix, Marussia's CEO Graeme Lowdon {{confirmed}} that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{return to a}} two-car operation {{for the remainder of}} the season, however, the team entered administration prior to the next race, the United States Grand Prix. The team's financial backer, Andrei Cheglakov, later revealed that Bianchi's crash was a key factor in the Russian's decision to end his financial support of the team and quit Formula One.|$|E
5|$|The Browns did {{not have}} any draft choices from 1996 to 1998, because then-owner Art Modell took all the team's players to Baltimore, Maryland, {{effectively}} stopping the franchise. However, the NFL mandated that the Browns' name, colors, and franchise history remain in Cleveland and that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> reactivate by 1999. In 1999, the Browns selected number one overall, drafting University of Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins renewed 99% {{of their}} season ticket sales from the 2007–08 season; having sold out 67consecutive games at Mellon Arena {{dating back to}} the 2006–07 season. In July, ESPN named Pittsburgh the top team in the Eastern Conference, and Sporting News {{predicted}} <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> finish in the league's fifth overall position.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> {{play against}} each other on a home-and-away basis. The winner would qualify.|$|R
50|$|Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> had to {{complete}} the Detour, a choice between Eat It Up or Roll It Out. In Eat It Up, <b>the</b> intersected <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> make their way one-and-a-half miles (2.4 km) to an old market. Once there, each team member had to use traditional methods to make a 3 in length of Polish kiełbasa (sausage). <b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> then be served 8 ft of cooked kiełbasa. Once each person ate 2 ft of sausage, <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> receive their next clue. In Roll It Out, <b>the</b> intersected <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> make their way one-and-a-half miles (2.4 km) to the J. Mazurek bakery in the city's Kazimierz, the Old Jewish Quarter, and properly roll out twenty bagels. When finished, they would carry a delivery of fresh bagels one-quarter mile (400 m) to Klezmer Hois, and receive their next clue.|$|R
50|$|For round two, <b>the</b> four <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> tackle an {{even more}} {{difficult}} challenge, another example, in Catch Me If You Can, <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> fight through barrels {{to get up on}} a platform. Some cars don't make it and fall upside-down sometimes. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> who doesn't make it up as far or with the slowest time is eliminated.|$|R
5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E
5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> have {{to play in a}} sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a new}} venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be tailor-made for basketball, and <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone.|$|E
50|$|The tournament was a {{knockout}} competition; just 17 teams entered with some notable absences, West Germany, Italy and England among them. <b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play home-and-away matches until the semi-finals; <b>the</b> final four <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> {{then move on}} to the final tournament, whose host was selected after <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> became known.|$|R
5000|$|House Competitions — For ten weeks, the two Houses {{compete in}} weekly major {{competitions}} with PHP150,000 {{at stake in}} each. At the end of those ten weeks, the cash accumulated by each <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be shared among the final five housemates in each House. <b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> also compete in [...] "mini-battles" [...] wherein <b>the</b> winning <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be given minor rewards.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules were}} very simple. <b>The</b> 9 <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play {{against each other}} on a home-and-away basis. <b>The</b> top 4 <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> qualify.|$|R
5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had {{had only two}} winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E
5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> have been unable to field their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E
5|$|Despite the setback, {{the team}} {{returned}} to the Eastern Conference Finals during the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and defeated the Philadelphia Flyers four games to two. They swept the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, as they brought the Cup across the Hudson River from New York, after the Rangers had won it the year before. The 1995 Devils team became the first to give the players a day with the Stanley Cup, a tradition that lives on with each Cup winner. Claude Lemieux was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP. The success came amid constant rumors that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> move {{for the third time}} in its history to Nashville.|$|E
5000|$|But <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> choose who {{was playing}} on <b>the</b> other <b>team.</b> <b>The</b> men pick Andrea {{for the girls}} and the girls pick Mark for the men ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2 In episode 5, the {{remaining}} Men and Women faced off for immunity. <b>The</b> winning <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be exempt {{for the next}} episode whereas <b>the</b> other <b>team</b> <b>would</b> face elimination <b>the</b> following episode.|$|R
5000|$|Final Round: <b>The</b> 3 <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> {{play against}} each other once in a neutral venue. The group winner and runner-up <b>would</b> qualify. <b>The</b> third-placed <b>team</b> <b>would</b> advance to <b>the</b> UEFA / CONMEBOL Intercontinental Play-off.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, South Bend {{community}} leaders began seeking a minor-league baseball {{team for the}} city. A stadium was constructed in 1986 and a 10-year player-development contract was signed with the Chicago White Sox. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{be known as the}} South Bend White Sox. In 1994, the team's name was changed to the South Bend Silver Hawks. The Silver Hawks changed their name to The South Bend Cubs in 2015. They are a Class A minor league affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in the Midwest League.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, the Sounds and Nashville SC, an {{expansion}} soccer {{team of the}} United Soccer League, reached a one-year agreement for Nashville SC to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park. Fan support of the team's games {{is expected to be}} a factor in Nashville's bid for a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise. If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park would not be a viable location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is expected to play its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, DeWitt {{announced}} plans for the Cardinals to renovate a baseball field in Sosúa in Taveras's honor, modeled after the Cardinals Care facilities in Greater St. Louis. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> also wear black circular patches inscribed with OT (Taveras's initials) inside a white circle on their jerseys. The patch will omit Taveras's No. 18 because Martínez is already wearing it as his uniform number as a tribute. A large decal in his memorial was posted in the home team bullpen of Busch Stadium along with the ones of Hancock and former pitcher Darryl Kile, who died of coronary artery disease during the 2002 season while still active.|$|E
50|$|On September 1, 2010, Commissioner Delany {{revealed}} how <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> {{be placed}} into the two divisions. They were provisionally called X and O.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 9 <b>teams</b> {{were divided}} into 3 groups of 3 <b>teams</b> each. <b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winners would qualify.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> 32 <b>teams</b> {{were divided}} into 7 groups. <b>The</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play against each other on a home-and-away basis. <b>The</b> number of <b>teams</b> and spots for each group were as follows: ...|$|R
5|$|In July, {{the team}} {{reclassified}} Max Bielfeldt from a redshirt junior to a senior, which freed up Bielfeldt's scholarship for the Class of 2015, implying Bielfeldt would play his {{final year of}} eligibility elsewhere. In November, Beilein announced that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> redshirt Andrew Dakich {{so that he could}} play a fifth year somewhere else. However, a pair of January backcourt injuries caused Dakich's services to be needed and he played instead of redshirting. D. J. Wilson missed most of the season due to a knee injury and was redshirted.|$|E
5|$|In Vancouver, the {{organization}} Save the Grizzlies {{was established to}} find a local investor to purchase the team. Led by among others Peter Ufford, they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team. Ufford retrospectively stated that had the attempt been given more time, {{they may have been}} able to secure a deal to keep the team in town, but that the relocation decision came too quickly for any plan to be finalized. Heisley stated that he had been willing to sell the team with a 30% discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> remain in town.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero decided that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{be more successful}} if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} a two-way tie for first, since both <b>teams</b> advance, there <b>would</b> be no extra game. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> that won <b>the</b> {{original}} game between <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> be declared <b>the</b> pool winner, and <b>the</b> other <b>team</b> <b>the</b> pool runner-up.|$|R
50|$|In March 1942, it {{was decided}} that no 1943 league {{champion}} would be recognized since all <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> not be able to play each other.|$|R
