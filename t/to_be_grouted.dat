5000|$|To {{decommission}} a MLS {{system in}} either open rock holes or in multi-screen casing, the MLS must either be removed {{to allow the}} hole <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouted</b> up, or the MLS must be designed such that, when left in place, it can be fully sealed by grouting (i.e. a [...] "grouted-in-place" [...] system). For backfilled installations, removal of the MLS can be difficult, so the MLS systems are typically grouted in place. Alternatively, the MLS must be drilled out or over-drilled for removal and then the over-drilled hole grouted up.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical dampers {{shut the}} cross {{sectional}} area of a duct {{in the event of}} a fire either by means of pivoting a fire-resistant board (in Europe), or by means of steel shutters, similar to blinds on a window (in North America). In the European designs, the turning mechanism is fully contained, permitting the dampers (subject to type approval) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouted</b> in place, which permits a heat sink effect to conduct heat from an accidental building fire, which impinges upon a duct and damper, to be conducted into surrounding structures. This also addresses the topic of smoke migration through the damper's annulus. In North American damper designs, the closing mechanism for the interior shutters resides on the outside of the damper, which is why NFPA 80 expressly prohibits the installation or presence of any materials in the damper's annulus, which are not mentioned in the manufacturer's instructions, which are governed by their certification listings. The closing mechanism must be allowed to operate, which necessitates that the annulus remain open, apart from an angle iron lip that surrounds the damper through-penetration in fire-resistance rated wall and floor assemblies. Maintenance efforts of mechanical dampers of both European and North American mechanical damper designs focus on the function of the mechanical shutting of the opening (which must be performed during inspection), as well as removal of any foreign objects that may otherwise impair this function.|$|E

40|$|A {{thermal probe}} method, called REKA (Rapid Evaluation of K and Alpha) {{has been used}} for {{determining}} thermal conductivity (K) and diffusivity (Alpha) at both the Large Heated Block Tests and in the ESF. The REKA method involves a single borehole probe with a heater and temperature measurement section. An elliptical temperature field is generated by the heater, and the temperature distribution {{along the length of the}} probe is recorded at several locations and at given time intervals for a period of 6 to 24 hours. A trial-and-error evaluation procedure is used to determine the unknown thermophysical properties by minimizing the RMS error between the measured and calculated temperature fields. If a conduction-only thermal model is used in the evaluation, the thermophysical properties will include the rockmass and the moisture effects, and the values will represent effective properties. If a hydrothermal model is also used, the difference between the effective and the rock matrix thermophysical properties can be related to hydrothermal characteristics. A reusable REKA probe can be applied to measure in situ rock properties in a short, open hole, e. g., in a rockbolt borehole, at low cost. A permanent REKA probe has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grouted</b> in the insertion hole, if an open hole is not acceptable due to the disturbance it may cause to other site characterization activities...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, {{a number}} of trenchless {{techniques}} have <b>been</b> developed <b>to</b> rehabilitate ageing underground pipes and drains. Some rehabilitation methods employ flowable cement-based grouts to fill and reinforce the gap between new and old pipe. For this process <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective, <b>grouts</b> need <b>to</b> have good fluidity and stable hardening characteristics to ensure optimum placement and integral of construction. Factors affecting fluidity and hardening characteristics include slurry preparation and pumping conditions. Deterioration of fluidity and hardening will cause filling problems and subsequent structural defects. Little research conducted {{on the effects of}} the mixing energy during slurry preparation has focused on the reasons or mechanisms for changes in characteristic properties. This paper describes and measures the effects of several mixing parameters on placing properties of grouts, such as fluidity, hardening characteristics and shrinkage of grouts. The results indicate that long mixing processes cause deterioration of flow and setting properties. These observations can be explained by changes in hydration kinetics and microstructure due to different mixing durations...|$|R
