5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 {{conviction}} {{and won a}} mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts {{would be willing to}} permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101–103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> profession would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.|$|E

Some unnamed Peruvian sources stated soon after the event occurred that it was indeed a meteorite. Later on 18 September, a Peruvian vulcanologist stated that the impact was caused by a chondrite meteorite arrival.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, it is imperative <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents {{come to a decision}} about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} note on {{the growth}} of hydropathy is that it started to become prominent as traditional medical practice was becoming more professional {{in terms of how}} doctors operated, alienating many patients, as they felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> encounter was becoming less personalized, and the more scientific the medical language became, the less that they could easily understand. Hydropathy was a return to a treatment that was spiritual and natural, making it more palatable to those who felt uncomfortable with the direction that traditional medicine was taking.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{advanced}} triage may become necessary when medical professionals decide <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> resources available {{are not sufficient}} to treat {{all the people who}} need help.

This has happened in disasters such as terrorist attacks, mass shootings, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and rail accidents. In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because of the severity of their injuries. Others would live if given immediate medical care, but would die without it.|$|E

40|$|Background The cost of {{healthcare}} {{is a matter}} of concern for the public and the authorities. When a new healthcare provider enters the healthcare market, specifically the private sector, it is crucial to know if the fees will be affordable, especially when that service provider claims to be able to offer a far less expensive service than his competitors. The newcomer, the traditional health practitioner, was awarded statutory status in South Africa in terms of the Traditional Health Practitioners Act No 22 (2007). Although the training and skills of the various types of health practitioners are central to their ability to deliver an effective health service and influence <b>the</b> specific fee <b>that</b> <b>the</b> practitioner will charge, the focus of this research is only the financial aspect. Factors such as the nature, complexity, risk and difficulty level of procedures influence fees. The question here is whether the traditional health practitioner’s fees are in general lower in comparison with <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> practitioner. Aims <b>The</b> study aimed to determine if the fees of the traditional health practitioner are in general lower in comparison with <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> practitioner. Methods This is an exploratory and descriptive study that makes use of a historical approach by means of investigation and a literature review. The emphasis is on using current documentation like articles, books and newspapers as primary sources to reflect on whether the fees of the traditional health practitioner are generally lower than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> practitioner. <b>The</b> findings are offered in narrative form. Results The research could not uncover any evidence to support <b>the</b> claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fees of the traditional health practitioner are lower in comparison with <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> practitioner. Conclusion This research could not confirm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fees of the traditional health practitioner are in general lower when compared with <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> practitione...|$|R

25|$|As the {{practice}} of vaccination was introduced and showed its effectiveness, patients began to have more confidence in medical healing. In 1781, the responsibility for medical care was formally transferred from church authority to the medical profession; patients were no longer admitted to the Hôtel-Dieu except for medical treatment, and doctors insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> treatment be scientific, not just spiritual. As medical schools became more connected to hospitals, the bodies of patients were seen as objects of medical observation used to study and teach pathological anatomy, rather than just bodies in need of hospital care.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the medical}} volunteers almost always receive the most media {{attention}} {{when the world}} becomes aware of an MSF field mission, {{there are a number}} of non-medical volunteers who help keep the field mission functioning.

They may be engineers and/or foremen, but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration/human resources experts who are placed with field missions.|$|E
