5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>and</b> maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, or groups {{of one or more}} sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>and</b> bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>and</b> neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune {{system in the}} form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
