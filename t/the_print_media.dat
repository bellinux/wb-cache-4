5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1968 election, Labor campaigned heavily around its leader, and this resonated with voters; in surveys conducted {{in parts of the}} metropolitan area, 84% of respondents declared their approval of Dunstan. In a presidential-style election campaign, Hall and Dunstan journeyed across the state advocating their platforms, and the major issues were the leaders, the Playmander and the economy. Television saw its first major use in the election, and Dunstan, an astute public speaker, successfully mastered it. With his upbeat style, Dunstan also made an impact in <b>the</b> <b>print</b> <b>media,</b> which had long been a bastion of the LCL. Despite winning a 52% majority of the primary vote, and 54% of the two-party preferred count, Labor lost two seats, resulting in a hung parliament: the LCL and Labor each had 19 seats. Had 21 votes in the rural seat of Murray gone the other way, Labor would have retained power. The balance of power rested with the chamber's lone independent, Tom Stott, who was offered the speakership by the LCL in return for his support on the Assembly floor. Stott, a conservative, agreed to support the LCL.|$|E

40|$|When {{compared}} to mainstream <b>print</b> <b>media,</b> <b>the</b> black <b>print</b> <b>media</b> has been improperly criticized, {{which leads to}} the question, how can and should the quality of the African American newspaper be measured?

There are four main criticisms of <b>the</b> black <b>print</b> <b>media</b> that are <b>the</b> focus of this research project. Examples from the California Eagle were used to disprove these four theories: 1) second rate: black newspapers are read after mainstream newspapers are read, 2) sensationalism: black newspapers produce extreme emotional agitation in people, 3) ?race angling:? black newspapers exaggerate race relations, and 4) Elitism: black newspapers caters more to black elites. Several studies of <b>the</b> black <b>print</b> <b>media</b> have used <b>the</b> mainstream <b>print</b> <b>media</b> as <b>the</b> standard to compare and criticize the black newspaper.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the major factors that influenced {{the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> press in Jordan between 1920 and 1998.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>print</b> <b>media</b> in India {{and abroad}} was largely {{sympathetic}} to the Indian cause, with editorials in newspapers based {{in the west and}} other neutral countries observing that Pakistan was largely responsible for the conflict.

As the fighting intensified, the Pakistani version of events found little backing on the world stage. This helped India gain valuable diplomatic recognition for its position.|$|E
25|$|Haughey was {{appointed}} by Fianna Fáil to run President Éamon de Valera's re-election campaign for the 1966 Irish presidential election. His interventions proved highly controversial. Fine Gael chose a comparatively young Teachta Dála and barrister, Tom O'Higgins (nephew of Kevin O'Higgins) to run against de Valera. Aware that de Valera's age (84) and almost total blindness might compare unfavourably to O'Higgins, whose campaign drew comparisons with the equally youthful United States president John F. Kennedy, Haughey launched what {{was seen as a}} political stroke. He insisted that it was beneath the presidency to actively campaign, meaning that de Valera would have a low profile. Therefore, in the interests of fairness the media was asked to give O'Higgins an equally low profile, ignoring his speeches and publicity campaign. <b>The</b> <b>print</b> <b>media,</b> both nationally and locally, ignored Haughey's suggestion. But the state-run Telifís Éireann, facing criticism from Lemass' government for being too radical in other areas, agreed and largely ignored the O'Higgins campaign.|$|E

Some of his {{partners}} in government, especially the National Alliance and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided un miracolo continuo (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognise these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in <b>the</b> <b>print</b> <b>media,</b> asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him. Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to deliver only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension rates.
