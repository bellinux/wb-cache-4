5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler {{that had not}} been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Carless {{makes an}} {{impressive}} speech in Persian <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> drivers to continue into Nuristan. They climb an extremely indistinct track to the pass. They descend into Nuristan: it grows hot. Men run to meet them: {{they are told}} {{they are the first}} Europeans ever to cross the pass (Newby doesn't believe this). They are given ice-cold milk to drink.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{findings}} of Rae and Anderson, the Admiralty did not plan another search of its own. Britain officially labelled the crew deceased in service on 31 March 1854. Lady Franklin, failing <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> government to fund another search, personally commissioned one more expedition under Francis Leopold McClintock. The expedition ship, the steam schooner Fox, bought via public subscription, sailed from Aberdeen on 2 July 1857.|$|E

5|$|Dressed in {{mourning}} {{for the remainder}} of her life, Queen Mary's first act as regent was to disseminate a manifesto, outlining James Francis Edward's claims. It was largely ignored in England. In Scotland, however, the confederate Lords sent Lord Belhaven to Saint-Germain, <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> Queen to surrender to them custody of James Francis Edward and accede to his conversion to Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|Early in Wetherby's term, the state's {{revenues}} were inflated by the Korean War. Having adopted a pay-as-you-go {{program for the}} state, {{he was forced to}} raise additional revenue after the war ended. He did so by imposing sin taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and parimutuel betting, but he was unable <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly to adopt a sales tax.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of the}} Science Council of Japan’s {{expert panel}} has said Japan's seismic {{conditions}} {{makes it difficult to}} predict ground conditions over the necessary 100,000 years, so it will be impossible <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> public of the safety of deep geological disposal.|$|E
5|$|The oldest Indian {{manuscript}} {{to mention}} Trijata's presence in Ayodhya is the Paumacriu. Many suggest that, after Sita's exile {{and the subsequent}} battle between Rama and his sons, Sita be reaccepted by Rama. Trijata and Lankasundari are called from Lanka to attest to Sita's chastity {{and both of them}} suggest an ordeal <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> world of her purity.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a {{piece of}} mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be {{supposedly}} born {{when it was time}} to leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E
5|$|After the 1928hurricane, {{the bodies}} buried at that {{location}} became mostly forgotten by the public.

5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This was not enough <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> state selectors and Harvey {{did not get a}} recall to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Isaac Shelby {{relocated}} to Kentucky, on lands awarded {{to him for}} his military service, and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county of Virginia, to a separate state. His heroism made him popular with the state's citizens and the Kentucky electoral college unanimously elected him governor in 1792.

The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{provides}} a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius {{and the other}} six nobles discussed {{the fate of the}} empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly pushed by Otanes, an oligarchy was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>the</b> other nobles.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to meet the UN's goal of {{reducing}} the number of hungry people in the world by half by 2015, Ambassador McGovern formulated detailed plans, urging delivery of more surplus food to foreign school-lunch programs and the establishment of specific targets such as had been done in old American programs.

5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant {{themes in the}} book, explored {{against the background of}} both planetary and interplanetary relations.

At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those in each country to view themselves as citizens of the planet.|$|E
