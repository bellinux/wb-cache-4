40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine {{the potential of the}} fungus, Aposphaeria amaranth!, as a bioherbicide for pigweeds (Amaranthus spp.). Experiments to establish the environmental parameters necessary for control of <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweed</b> (A. albus) demonstrated that an 8 -hr dew period was sufficient for control of seedlings with four to six leaves, and that temperatures ranging from 20 to 28 C were conducive for disease development. Conidial concentrations as lowas 1 x 10 s conidia per ml also were sufficient for plant mortality. Host range tests demonstrated pathogenicity of A. amaranthi to several other species of Amaranthus, including biotypes resistant to triazine herbicides. Disease on redroot pigweed (A. retroflexus) was enhanced by incorporation of surfactants into inoculum suspensions. Field tests conducted in 1990 resulted in 73 % control of redroot pigweed and 99 % control of <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweed.</b> These results suggest that Aposphaeria amaranthi has potential as a bioherbicide for controlling pigweeds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{experiment}} was conducted for evaluation the allelopathic potential of extract soybean shoot on seed germination and seedling growth of four weed species <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweed,</b> smooth pigweed, common lambsqurters and black nightshade. For each species a factorial {{experiment was}} used in a completely randomized design with three replications. Plant shoots were gathered in flowering stage and individually dried and then ground.

40|$|Preplant {{incorporated}} and/or preemergence herbicide treatments including metolachlor (Dual®), EPTC with safener (Eradicane®), cyanazine (Bladex®), pendimethalin (Prowl®), and tank-mix combinations provided good (88 %) to excellent (> 98 %) {{weed control}} of prostrate and <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweeds</b> and purslane in sweet corn...|$|R
40|$|Preemergence {{herbicide}} treatments metolachlor (Dual®) and pendimethalin (Prowl®) gave {{better than}} acceptable weed control (> 85 %) of prostrate and <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweeds,</b> puncturevine, common purslane, and groundcherry in cantaloupes. Preplant incorporated treatments provided less than adequate control of pigweeds and groundcherry. Bentazon (Basagran®) applied postemergence gave good control of pigweeds but groundcherry control was marginal. Napropamide (Devrinol®), trifluralin (Treflan®), and DCPA (Dacthal (D) caused cantaloupe stand reduction and injury. Bensulide (Prefar®) and Basagran® were safe when applied on cantaloupes...|$|R
40|$|Soybean yield {{reductions}} from sunflower and velvetleaf {{on a per}} plant basis {{were over}} twice as great in 1986 as in 1987, but were similar on a total weight basis. Tall waterhemp caused greater yield reductions on a total weight basis in 1987 than in 1986, but similar reductions on a plant basis each year. Soybean yield reductions from sunflower interference were 27 percent at 2 sunflowers per 11. 3 m row in 1986 and 17 percent at 4 per row in 1987. Yield reductions from 6 velvetleaf per row were 22 and 7 percent and from 6 tall waterhemp 15 and 12 percent in 1986 and 1987 respectively. ^ To economically justify postemergence control 0. 4 and 1. 2 sunflower, 0. 5 and 7. 8 velvetleaf, and 1. 1 and 1. 2 tall waterhemp were needed per 10 m row 1986 and 1987 respectively. ^ In growth chamber studies fresh weight of grain amaranth and giant pigweed were highest and prostrate pigweed lowest at 30 / 24 C, 24 / 18 C and 18 / 12 C day/night temperature regimes. Giant pigweed emerged and grew most rapidly. ^ Giant, grain and Palmer were least and tall waterhemp and redroot most susceptible to preemergence herbicides. Metolachlor applied preemergence at 0. 84 kg/ha resulted in 52 and 74 percent grain amaranth and prostrate pigweed growth reduction compared to 94 to 100 percent for the others. Least susceptible to postemergence herbicides were spiny, Palmer and giant <b>pigweed</b> with prostrate, <b>tumble,</b> and redroot <b>pigweed</b> most susceptible. Bentazon applied postemergence resulted in 4, 39 and 36 percent control of spiny, Palmer and giant pigweed, compared to 74, 59 and 52 percent for redroot, <b>tumble</b> and prostrate <b>pigweeds.</b> ^ 14 C bentazon absorption did not always correspond to growth reduction of pigweeds. Least 14 C was absorbed by prostrate although growth reduction was high. Palmer, giant and smooth also absorbed little 14 C. Tumble, redroot and spiny amaranth absorbed a high amount of 14 C bentazon with a corresponding high growth reduction of <b>tumble</b> and redroot <b>pigweeds,</b> but little growth reduction of spiny amaranth. ...|$|R
40|$|All {{herbicide}} treatments, Prefar, Frontier, Dual Magnum, Valor, and Prefar {{combined with}} Dual Magnum or Frontier caused less than 10 % injury on cantaloupes. Frontier at 0. 75 lb AI/A, Dual Magnum at 1. 0 lb AI/A, Valor at 0. 03 and 0. 05 lb AI/A controlled weeds similar to Prefar. Prefar at 4. 0 lb AI/A combined with Frontier controlled <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweed</b> (94 %), narrowleaf lambsquarters (95 %), Wright’s groundcherry (97 %), and horse purslane (94 %).

40|$|At 4 {{weeks after}} {{treatment}} (WAT), all preemergence (PREE) treatments were completely safe on cantaloupes. At 1 WAT of postemergence (POST) applications, marginally acceptable melon injury (11 to 19 %) was observed. At 6 WAT, crop injury increased significantly for both halosulfuron and bentazon. Halosulfuron (POST) following bensulide (PREE) caused minimal crop injury. The pigweeds were marginally controlled when POST treatments followed PREE herbicides. <b>Tumble</b> <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus albus) {{was more difficult}} to control than prostrate pigweed (A. blitoides).

5000|$|Cycloloma is a {{monotypic}} genus {{which contains}} the sole species Cycloloma atriplicifolium, {{which is known}} by the common names winged <b>pigweed,</b> <b>tumble</b> ringwing, plains tumbleweed, [...] and tumble-weed. This plant is native to central North America, but it is spreading and has been occasionally reported in far-flung areas from California to Maine to the Canadian prairie. It is considered an introduced species outside of central North America. This is a bushy annual herb forming a rounded pale green clump which may exceed half a meter in height. It is very intricately branched, with toothed leaves occurring near the base. The spreading stems bear widely spaced flowers are small immature fruits fringed with a nearly transparent membranous wing. In autumn, the plant forms a tumbleweed. [...] The fruit is a utricle about 2 millimeters long containing a single seed.|$|R
40|$|Several pigweed {{species are}} found in the Great Plains. Pigweeds {{commonly}} reduce crop yields and interfere with harvest. One means of controlling these weeds is through the use of herbicides. Recent research indicates that some pigweed species respond differently to various herbicides; therefore, proper identification is needed for good control. This extension contains a generalized distribution map; photographs of seeds, seedling, and mature plants; and text describing other identifying features for each pigweed species. The species are grouped with others that have similar shape and form. The pigweed species listed in this publication are: redroot pigweed, smooth pigweed, Powell amaranth, spiny amaranth, <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweed,</b> prostrate pigweed, common waterhemp, tall waterhemp, and Palmer amaranth...|$|E
40|$|Solarization is {{a method}} of soil {{disinfestation}} that relies upon high temperatures to reduce populations of pest organisms in the soil (Stapleton and De Vay 1986). Soil temperatures above 45 C {{have been found to}} reduce emergence of seeds of annual weed species (Horowitz et al. 1983, Peachey et al. 2001). While solarization has promise as a potential alternative to soil fumigation, specific guidelines for treatment are lacking (Stapleton et al. 2000). Time and temperature requirements for thermal death have already been determined for seeds of six weed species (annual sowthistle, barnyardgrass, black nightshade, common purslane, London rocket, and <b>tumble</b> <b>pigweed)</b> at temperatures reached during solarization (Dahlquist et al. 2007). We determined the time required for thermal death for seeds of two additional weed species, yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.) and black mustard (Brassica nigra L.), at 50 C. Seeds were placed in organdy bags and allowed to imbibe water at room temperature for 2 hours before heat treatment. Seed bags were placed in 0. 47 -L mason-type canning jars filled with 30 -grit silica sand wetted to field capacity (10. 4 % moisture) with deionized water and maintained at 50 C in a water bath. Six jars per species were maintained at 50 C, and three jars were kept at room temperature as controls. In each experiment, three to four bags of seeds were placed i...|$|E
40|$|A "double-tent " {{solarization}} technique, which develops higher {{soil temperatures}} than solarization of open fields, was recently {{approved by the}} California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) as a nematicidal treatment for containerized nursery production. The technique was tested for effect as an herbicidal treatment. Laboratory-derived thermal death dosages (temperature x time) for six weed species important in California [Portulaca oleracea (common purslane), Amaranthus albus (<b>tumble</b> <b>pigweed),</b> Sonchus oleraceus (annual sowthistle), Sisymbrium irio (London rocket), Solanum nigrum (black nightshade), and Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) ] were determined, as previously reported. In a field validation of the laboratory data, moist soil which was placed in black polyethylene (poly) planting bags containing seeds of the six test species was subjected to 24 hours of solarization after reaching a threshold temperature of 60 C (2 hours after initiation of the experiment). Other samples of weed seeds were incubated under ambient temperature (ca. 23 C). Samples were removed at 2, 4, 20, and 24 hours after reaching the 60 C threshold. They were then incubated at ca. 7 C for 12 weeks to ameliorate possible secondary dormancy effects. After the cold treatment, seeds were moistened and incubated at a temperature regimen of 16 hours at 30 C and 8 hours at 20 C, with exposure to a fluorescent grow-light during the 30 C cycle. Apart from the non-solarized control treatment, no weed seeds germinated {{at any of the}} sampling periods, in accordance with the laboratory thermal death data. The "double-tent " solarization technique may be useful to many growers of containerized plants in warmer areas of California...|$|E
