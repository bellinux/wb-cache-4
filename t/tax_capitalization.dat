40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} the extent to which corporate and personal income taxes are capitalized in bond prices. The methodology yields {{estimates of the}} degree of <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization,</b> rather than an implied tax rate. This makes it straightforward to identify the marginal investor and test for changes in <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization.</b> The empirical approach also makes it unnecessary to jointly estimate the degree of <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> and the entire yield curve. Corporate taxes are found to have been fully capitalized in pre-tax Government of Canada bond yields during the period 1986 - 1993. Since 1994, taxes have not been capitalized in yields. These results are consistent with the existence of a marginal investor, but the identity of the marginal investor changed from a financial sector firm to a non-taxed entity in the early 1990 s. ...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{asserted}} that taxation distorts the production decisions of timber land owners. More recently, claims have been that this does not occur because the tax is fully shifted into sawlog prices. This paper constructs a model of landowner choice between a property tax programme and a modified yield tax programme under the assumption of <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization.</b> Under tax shifting, the landowner will be indifferent between tax regimes. With <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> owners of younger stands will elect to classify their stands for the modified yield tax programme. An empirical model of binary choice is evaluated using cross sectional forty level data from Cowlitz County, Washington immediately after implementation of the Reforestation Act of 1931. The empirical results suggest that landowners are responsive to differences in the taxing pattern in a manner conforming to the theoretical predictions consistent with <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization.</b> Additional results suggest that implementation of the alternate tax regime may have {{had little effect on}} tax defaults.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{develops}} {{and tests}} {{a model of}} <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> in stock prices. The key innovation of the model is consideration of how distribution policy affects {{the extent to which}} dividend and capital gains taxes are impounded into stock prices. The key innovation of the empirical analysis is the use of data aggregated to the national level to reduce measurement error and to encompass a long time series (49 years) {{with a wide range of}} tax regimes. This study finds supporting evidence for the hypotheses that both dividend and capital gains taxes reduce stock prices, as well as the hypothesis that stock repurchase intensity shifts the capitalization effect from dividend taxes to capital gains taxes. <b>Tax</b> <b>Capitalization</b> in Stock Prices: Theory and Evidence on the Interaction between Distribution Policy and Tax Rates An important issue in the valuation of equity is the influence of shareholder taxes on both dividends and capital gains. Since taxes reduce the after-tax cash flows received by investors, one would expect stock prices (which should equal the present value of after-tax cash flows received from investment in stock) to be negatively related to both dividend and capital gains tax rates. Moreover, one would expect that actions taken by firms to avoid the adverse cash flow effects of these taxes (through stock repurchases, for example) should alter the magnitude of this <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> effect. <b>Tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> models in the literature include Auerbach (1979), Bradfor...|$|E
30|$|There is {{evidence}} that taxes capitalize into housing prices, but great uncertainty about the magnitude of income <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization.</b> One explanation why empirical evidence is unclear may stem {{from the fact that}} capitalization is something personal, depending on income, mobility, and on the individual tax burden of the bidding households. Therefore, income <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> may theoretically differ substantially between different housing price segments. Results obtained from the analysis of a large Swiss dataset suggest that capitalization is lower for apartments for rent compared to apartments for sale. Capitalization is insignificant or less than 100 % for all rental segments. Concerning apartments for sale, capitalization is well above 100 % for the low and top price segments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the welfare {{implications of a}} tax on real estate transfers. A theoretical analysis shows how the discouragement of mutually beneficial transactions as well as tax- sheltering activities {{give rise to a}} welfare loss that can be estimated using the empirical elasticity of the tax base. In the absence of tax planning and <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> effects, the elasticity of the tax base is determined by the hazard rate to deter transactions at the margin. With tax planning, the elasticity of the tax base is also driven by the "technology" of tax sheltering. The paper also shows how <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> effects can be accounted for in the welfare analysis. Empirical evidence on the deadweight loss is obtained from the analysis of real estate transfer taxes in Germany. After a constitutional reform has granted the German states the right to set the local rate of the real estate transfer tax, over the last ten years many states have made use of this discretion and have increased the tax rate - some of them repeatedly. Based on the empirical estimate of the revenue effect of these tax increases and of <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> effects, the paper shows that the German experience points to a substantial welfare cost of real estate transfer taxation...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that local {{provision}} {{of public education}} increases the human capital of school-age children {{and the value of}} the housing. The second effect, called capitalization, means that the higher the expenditure in local public education, the higher the value of the housings. In a two-community model, we show that when capitalization is sufficiently strong, the marginal benefit from the higher tax, capitalized into the housing price, allows childless households to vote for a positive tax. In particular, low income childless households vote for a <b>tax</b> raise when <b>capitalization</b> is strong, whereas high income childless supports a higher <b>tax</b> when <b>capitalization</b> is weak. The median income voter is never pivotal because "ends with the middle" coalitions arise; high income households (with and without a child) make coalition with middle income class with a child, whereas low income households (with and without a child) make coalition with childless middle income class. We find that the income of the childless median voter is higher than the median income, whereas the median voter with a child has income lower than the median. Thus, the equilibrium tax preferred by the median voter (childless or not), is higher than the tax preferred by the childless median income voter and lower than the tax preferred by the median income voter with a child. This result implies that {{it is not possible to}} exclude voting equilibria in which the tax of the childless median voter is higher than the tax of the median voter with a child. When capitalization disappears, only households with a child vote for a positive tax, coalitions among the voters with and without a child arise to block public provision of local educatio...|$|R

Height of these prices is determined according to the needs of transnational company, because transfer pricing are, on one hand, significant from the standpoint of transnational companies because they provide them with a possibility to adapt tax base to their goals (profit increase), and on the other hand, from the standpoint of tax authorities of host country. Today, a big part of trade takes place on global level, where transnational companies dominate and which, through transfer pricing, increase net gain, as well as on reduction of income, which flows into the budget of host country in the form of taxes.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the boundary between urban economics and local public finance, defined as research that considers both a housing market and the market for local public services. The first part of the chapter considers positive theories. This part presents the consensus model of the allocation of households to jurisdictions, which is built on bid functions and household sorting, as well as alternative approaches to this issue. It also examines models of local tax and spending decisions, which exhibit no consensus, and reviews research in which both housing and local fiscal variables are endogenous. The second part of the chapter considers empirical research, with a focus on <b>tax</b> and service <b>capitalization,</b> on household heterogeneity within jurisdictions, and on the impact of zoning. The third part considers normative theories about a decentralized system of local governments. This part examines the extent to which such a system leads to an efficient allocation of households to communities or efficient local public service levels, and it discusses the fairness of local public spending. This review shows that the bidding/sorting framework is strongly supported by the evidence and has wide applicability in countries with decentralized governmental systems. In contrast, models of local public service determination depend on institutional detail, and their connections with housing markets have been largely unexplored in empirical work. Ever since Tiebout (1956), many scholars have argued that decentralized local governments have efficiency advantages over centralized forms. However, a general treatment of this issue identifies four key sources of inefficiency even in a decentralized system: misallocation of households to communities, the property <b>tax,</b> public service <b>capitalization</b> and heterogeneity. Few policies to eliminate these sources of inefficiency have yet been identified. Finally, this review explores the equity implications of household sorting and other features of a decentralized system. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{tax burden}} on equity {{securities}} has varied substantially since US {{federal income taxes}} were introduced in 1913. Taxes on equity securities vary over time due to changes in dividend and capital gains tax rates and due to changes in corporate payout policies. Equity taxes also vary across firms due to persistent differences in propensities to pay dividends. Despite the continu-ing policy debate {{on the level of}} dividend and capital gains taxes, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the effects of tax changes on equity valuations. This study investigates empirically whether changes in investment tax rates had an impact on US equity prices over the period between 1913 and 2006. My paper contrasts two hypotheses of whether taxes are capitalized into equity valuations. Under the <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> hypothesis, aggregate equity valuation measures are inversely related to the tax burden on equity securities. In this case, an increase in investment tax rates reduces the valuation of equity securities generating higher expected before-tax returns. The higher expected returns compensate taxable investors for their increased tax burden. Thus, aggregate equity valu-ation levels should be relatively low during time periods when investment taxes are high. In contrast to the <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> hypothesis, Merton H. Miller and Myron S. Scholes (1978) postulate that investment taxes can be avoided in perfect capital markets and that the marginal Tax Changes and Asset Pricin...|$|E
40|$|The Czech {{tax system}} is {{undergoing}} radical transformation. Among the many forthcoming changes, several features can be identified, which alter {{the structure of}} tax asymmetries. This paper uses an option-based model of direct taxation to examine a controversial new thin-capitalization rule, stipulating a mandatory benchmark for deductible unrelated-party loan expenses. We estimate the costs of debt under various risk-related scenarios, focusing on particular situations where the new regulation may result in distortions of business incentives and investment behaviour. We find that the measure can disproportionally increase the marginal cost of debt for companies with relatively risky business profiles. In particular, if the law were followed strictly, it could create effective barriers to further growth under perfectly realistic combinations of leverage and business risk. Another asymmetry arises due to a small-business exemption which can make new investment prohibitive when its cap is being reached. The model also suggests that non-deductibility of interest increases credit risk and could, in the longer term, contribute to a slack in SME lending. real options, thin <b>capitalization,</b> <b>tax</b> asymmetry,, Merton model of debt...|$|R

40|$|In an {{environment}} of increasing government expenditures financed largely viii through taxes, including a relatively visible and large residential property tax, {{the issue of whether}} property taxes are capitalized into market values is increasingly important. Property <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> is the reflection of property taxes in the value of real property. The capitalization of property tax does not necessarily pose a problem; rather, problems arise when homes identical to each other have different taxes and these differentials are then capitalized into market values. These capitalized tax differentials result in large capital gains and losses to owners of real estate. This study (1) reviews existing economic theory and empirical evidence on the capitalization of property taxes, (2) develops a model of property valuation inclusive of tax effects, and (3) estimates the parameters of this model using a comprehensive data set of over 334 home sales in the Logan, Utah area. The empirical results include an estimate of the <b>tax</b> <b>capitalization</b> effect. Two closely related issues are also addressed in the study.
