2500|$|The {{successful}} use of simulation, {{early in}} the lifecycle, has been largely driven by increased integration of simulation tools with the entire CAD, CAM and PLM solution-set. Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a multi-CAD environment, and include solutions for managing simulation data and processes and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history. The ability to use simulation across the entire lifecycle has been enhanced through improved user interfaces such as <b>tailorable</b> user interfaces and [...] "wizards" [...] which allow all appropriate PLM participants {{to take part in}} the simulation process.|$|E

50|$|ISO/IEC 14651:2011, Information {{technology}} -- International string ordering {{and comparison}} -- Method for comparing character strings and {{description of the}} common template <b>tailorable</b> ordering, is an ISO Standard specifying an algorithm {{that can be used}} when comparing two strings. This comparison can be used when collating a set of strings. The standard also specifies a datafile specifying the comparison order, the Common <b>Tailorable</b> Template, CTT. The comparison order is supposed to be tailored for different languages (hence the CTT is regarded as a template and not a default, though the empty tailoring, not changing any weighting, is appropriate in many cases), since different languages have incompatible ordering requirements. One such tailoring is European ordering rules (EOR), which in turn is supposed to be tailored for different European languages.|$|E

The systems that resulted from this research are the Electronic Information Exchange System, as well as the continuations: The Electronic Information Exchange System 2 (EIES2), and the <b>Tailorable</b> Electronic Information Exchange System (TEIES). One of the foremost developments of EIES was that of the [...] "Virtual Classroom", a term coined by Dr. Starr Roxanne Hiltz. This was the first e-learning platform in the world, and was unique in that it evolved onto an existing communications system, rather than having a system created specifically for it.

50|$|In the Raman effect, photons are red- or blue-shifted by optical phonons with a {{frequency}} of about 15 THz. However, silicon waveguides also support acoustic phonon excitations. Their interaction with light is called Brillouin scattering. The frequencies and mode shapes of these acoustic phonons {{are dependent on}} the geometry {{and size of the}} silicon waveguides. Therefore, the frequencies are <b>tailorable</b> from a few MHz to tens of GHz. Their interaction with light can among others be used to make narrowband optical amplifiers. The interaction between photons and acoustic phonons is also studied in the field of cavity optomechanics, although 3D optical cavities are not necessary to observe the interaction. For instance, besides in silicon waveguides the optomechanical coupling has also been demonstrated in fibers and in chalcogenide waveguides.|$|E

Army regional alignment is an organizing principle that improves the Army’s {{ability to provide}} units and capabilities. Regional alignment provides focus and direction for unit training and preparation. RAFs are drawn from the Army Total Force, which includes active United States Army, the Army National Guard and the United States Army Reserve.

Through regional alignment, the Army maintains its war-fighting skills and complements these skills with language, regional expertise and cultural awareness training.|$|E
5000|$|OIF III- From October 2004 to October 2005, the 68th Corps Support Battalion {{deployed}} to Taji, Iraq to provide {{command and control}} of medium (petroleum and general cargo) and heavy lift transportation support, <b>tailorable</b> ammunition supply support, direct support maintenance, bulk petroleum and CL IX supply support to divisional and non-divisional units in their area of operations. While deployed the unit trained the 1st Iraqi Truck Regiment for the transition authority to support the downsizing of coalition forces within theater. The battalion tracked flights for over 1,800 soldiers and performed perimeter guard with over 108 Soldiers to include training and providing a quick reaction force as needed. The Stagecoach Soldiers executed 1,859 transportation movement requests while conducting 1,132 combat logistics patrols. These Soldiers traveled 2,513,712 miles transporting 31,475,746 gallons of CL III(B) and 179,372 short tons of commodity while their Direct Support Maintenance Company completed 2,122 maintenance jobs.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrophilic {{surfaces}} are generally created {{one of two}} ways; the first being physisorption of an amphiphilic diblock co-polymer where the hydrophobic block adsorbs to the surface, leaving the hydrophilic block available for anti-fouling purposes. The second way is via surface initiated polymerization techniques which has been greatly influence {{by the development of}} controlled radical polymerization techniques such as Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP). The physisorption results in mushroom regimes leaving much of the surface area of the hydrophilic polymer coiled up on itself while the grafting from approach results in highly ordered, <b>tailorable,</b> brush polymers. A film that is either too thick or too thin will adsorb particles onto the surface, therefore film thickness becomes an important parameter in the synthesis of ultra-low fouling surfaces. Film thickness is determined by three factors that can be tailored individually to produce the desired thickness: one being the length of the polymer chains, the second being the grafting density and the last being the solvent concentration during polymerization. The length of the chains is easily manipulated by varying the degree of polymerization by changing the ratio of initiator to monomer. The grafting density can be adjusted through varying the density of initiator on the surface. Film thickness can be theoretically calculated by the equation below; ...|$|E
50|$|The {{resources}} {{the military}} could bring would be extensive using both Active Duty and Reserve military forces {{as well as}} National Guard units. Medical personnel and supplies would be brought in as well as specially trained search and rescue units trained to work in contaminated environments. Stock piles of food, water and medical supplies would also be brought to points just outside {{the perimeter of the}} disaster area for redistribution. Aircraft could be brought to transport large numbers of casualties or bring in supplies. The Army Chemical Corps would bring CBRN or Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear units to decontaminate survivors of an attack as well as personnel, vehicles and equipment entering and leaving the contamination area. Additionally, the US Army could bring in CCMRF Units. CCMRF is a Title 10 task force with both Active and Reserve Components. CCMRF's primary role when responding to a CBRN event is to augment the consequence management efforts of the first responders. The CCMRF fielding plan establishes three separate CCMRFs to provide a response capability to multiple CBRNE events. CCMRFs are identical in force structure and are self-sustaining and <b>tailorable</b> to any CBRNE event. A CCMRF has unique CBRNE trained personnel and equipment as well as general purpose forces trained to operate in a CBRNE environment. Survivors in such a disaster scenario could become desperate and hostile. The military would provide emergency personnel force protection such as armed escorts to ensure against possible attacks. Military forces would also be providing real time intelligence on changing ground conditions. Military forces would also quickly construct a communications network. The US Army Corp of Engineers would be able to help construct temporary shelters for the injured and emergency responders as well as to determine the soundness of structures damaged in the attack such as bridges, dams or large buildings that have the potential to become a hazard. They would also be involved in the long term rebuilding of more permanent structures as well. Naval forces would also serve as floating hospitals and treatment centers. Additionally, hundreds of members of the US Marine Corps (USMC) CBIRF or Chemical Biological and Incident Response Force would become the shock troops for search and rescue operations redeploying from locations around the world to the site of impact. The US Coast Guard (USCG) would also be helping with search and rescue and medical support but would be {{under the control of the}} DHS.|$|E

40|$|To change {{applications}} {{to fit the}} needs for users, for different places and for development over time {{has long been a}} challenge called software maintenance.

To develop <b>tailorable</b> software raise new challenges; how to make a user friendly tailoring interface, how to decide what should be <b>tailorable</b> and how to make a software architecture that permits this, how to make the <b>tailorable</b> system having an acceptable performance. Our experiences also show that the boarders between maintenance and use become vague since tailorability can replace maintenance by professional software engineers with tailoring by advanced users.

40|$|Designing <b>tailorable</b> {{groupware}} is {{an important}} but challenging research issue. First, we give reasons for a <b>tailorable</b> groupware design based on longitudinal studies in two organizations of political administration. Then we develop the concept of Integrated Organization and Technology Development to guide the processes of software development and organizational appropriation. This approach {{is based on a}} participatory and evolutionary process model which requires to deal with organizational and technical issues in an integrated way. Next, three <b>tailorable</b> groupware functionalities are presented: a search tool for groupware, extended access control mechanisms and an awareness service. For each of these functionalities, the design requirements were derived from a participatory development process. Moreover, we describe the implementations, which are innovative from a technical as well as from a design point of view. An evaluation of the functionality in two organizations of the political administration has been carried out. Finally, we present concepts of the dialogue interface, which support users in tailoring groupware. The concepts of Direct Activation and Explorative Execution are described. Direct Activation supports users in finding tailoring functions at the appropriate moment. Explorative Execution supports users in learning about <b>tailorable</b> groupware functions in an explorative manner. Both of these concepts increase the usability of <b>tailorable</b> groupware. They were implemented to improve the three <b>tailorable</b> functionalities presented earlier. Finally, a qualitative as well as a test-statistical evaluation of these concepts was conducted and the results are discussed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tailorable</b> {{technologies}} are {{a class of}} information systems designed with the intention that users modify and redesign the technology {{in the context of}} use. <b>Tailorable</b> technologies support user goals, intentions, metaphor, and use patterns in the selection and integration of technology functions in the creation of new and unique information systems. We propose a theory of <b>tailorable</b> technology design and identify principles necessary for the initial design. Following a Kantian style of inquiry, we identified four definitional characteristics of <b>tailorable</b> technology: a dual design perspective, user engagement, recognizable environments, and component architectures. From these characteristics, we propose nine design principles that will support the phenomenon of tailoring. Through a year-long case study, we refined and evidenced the principles, finding found that designers of <b>tailorable</b> technologies build environments in which users can both interact and engage with the technology, supporting the proposed design principles. The findings highlight a distinction between a reflective environment, where users recognize and imagine uses for the technology, and an active environment in which users tailor the technology in accordance with the imagined uses. This research contributes to the clarification of the role of theory in design science, expands the concept of "possibilities for action " to IS design, and proposes a design theory of a class of information systems for testing and refinement...|$|E
40|$|The {{intention}} of <b>tailorable</b> systems {{is to make}} it possible for end users to evolve an application to better fit altered requirements and tasks, and to make the system more endurable. This thesis discusses <b>tailorable</b> systems in the context of a rapidly changing business environment. The objective was to determine what is necessary for a <b>tailorable</b> business system to continuously adapt to expanding requirements and thereby live up to the {{intention of}} the system. The thesis includes five different studies, of which one is a literature study. The other four studies were conducted in three projects; one technical project exploring the possibility to use Metaobject Protocol in <b>tailorable</b> systems, one project in an explorative environment concerned with physical interfaces and one project, that also embraced user participation and user evaluation, regarded the possibility for end users to manage system infrastructure. The projects began with field studies (including participant observations and interviews) and workshops with users and developers. In each project, based on the outcome, an end-user <b>tailorable</b> prototype was developed. The prototypes were used for evaluating possibilities and problems with <b>tailorable</b> systems. Taken together the evaluations revealed what was required to make a <b>tailorable</b> system work as intended in a rapidly changing business environment. It could be concluded that tailoring is a good way to evolve a system to meet altered needs, because people who already possess the required domain knowledge can make changes quickly. Tailoring is not however enough, because the tailoring capabilities are always limited, meaning that tailoring cannot support completely unanticipated changes. In such cases the tailoring capabilities must be extended. Since such changes are only concerned with the system itself, and not the business task, it is hard to motivate even skilled users to make these types of changes. Tailoring activities must therefore be coordinated with software evolution activities performed by professional developers. This allows the system to adapt continuously to a rapidly changing business environment and thereby live up to the intention of the system. The final conclusion is that there is a need for close collaboration between end users, tailors and developers to make <b>tailorable</b> information systems adaptable to rapid changes in the business environment as well as being endurable. The collaboration has to be supported in the structure of the system by providing support for the work of users, tailors and developers...|$|E
