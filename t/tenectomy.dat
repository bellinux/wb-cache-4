40|$|Abstract: Most of {{the methods}} used to deflight birds have one or more disadvantages, {{including}} impermanence, poor cosmetic appearance, or impairment of breeding function. We hypothesized that transection of the tendon of the supracoracoideus muscle at its insertion on the proximal humerus would impair a bird’s ability to raise the affected wing and thus result in flightlessness. The purpose of this project was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of unilateral or bilateral surgical <b>tenectomy</b> of the supracoracoideus muscle in deflighting cockatiels and pigeons. Six pigeons (Co-lumba livia) and 9 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) were included in the study. Three cockatiels were included in a sham group, and 3 birds of each species were included in a unilateral or bilateral <b>tenectomy</b> group. The birds in the sham group did not have flight difficulties at any time after surgery. Three cockatiels and 1 pigeon in the unilateral <b>tenectomy</b> group were flying within 3 – 6 weeks, respectively, after surgery. A ligament instead of a tendon was inadvertently transected in 2 of the pigeons in the unilateral group. These pigeons were able to fly the day after surgery. We did not euthanize these birds to confirm this suspicion. In the bilateral <b>tenectomy</b> groups, 1 of 2 cockatiels and 2 of 3 pigeons were eventually able to fly short distances within 4 to 6 months after surgery. In the same groups, 1 cockatiel died several hours after surgery and 1 pigeon was eutha-nized 6 weeks after surgery. The pigeon never regained its ability to right itself when placed on its back. Gross necropsies in both birds confirmed that the tendons of the supracoracoideous muscles had been transected. None of the birds undergoing unilateral or bilateral <b>tenectomy</b> had normal dorsal extension of the affected wing, but each was able to fly well enough to escape if taken outdoors. We concluded that neither unilateral nor bilateral supracoracoideus <b>tenectomy</b> is an ef-fective technique for deflighting cockatiels or pigeons...|$|E
40|$|Purposes: To objectively {{evaluate}} the torsional {{effect of the}} superior oblique muscle-weakening surgery using the <b>tenectomy</b> technique proposed by Souza-Dias. Methods: The present prospective study included 10 patients (20 eyes) with horizontal strabismus, bilateral superior oblique overaction and A-pattern of 15 to 30 prism diopters who underwent superior oblique <b>tenectomy.</b> Objective assessment of ocular torsion was performed by retinography immediately before and one month after surgery. The amount of ocular torsion was determined by measuring the angle formed by a horizontal line drawn across the geometric center of the optic disc and a second line connecting this point to the fovea. Results: The median preoperative angle was 5. 56 &# 176; in the right eyes and - 3. 43 &# 176; in the left eyes. The median postoperative angle was 1. 84 &# 176; in the right eyes and - 3. 12 &# 176; in the left eyes. The angle variation was statistically significant in both eyes (p= 0. 012 and p= 0. 01, respectively). Conclusion: The present study suggests that superior oblique <b>tenectomy</b> has an extorter effect, decreasing the intorsion detected on overaction of this muscle...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the degree of}} reunion in rabbit eyes of the superior oblique tendon after several surgical weakening procedures. Methods: A total of 32 rabbits (64 eyes) were used in this study. The rabbits {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups, eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the tenotomy group, eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the <b>tenectomy</b> group, eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the disinsertion group and eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the recession group. The degree of reunion or reattachment of the superior oblique tendon on the globe were examined on four eyes in each group at postoperative weeks two, four, six and eight. Results: At eight weeks, the newly created insertion site remained at the same site in all eyes in the recession group, and the distal end of the superior oblique tendon was reattached at the medial border of the superior rectus muscle in all four eyes in the tenotomy and disinsertion groups, and in three of four eyes in the <b>tenectomy</b> group. Conclusions: From this experimental study, it was speculated that superior oblique recession is more effective than other superior oblique weakening procedures. This result could be helpful in the prediction of time of recurrence for superior oblique overaction after superior oblique weakening procedures...|$|E

40|$|INTERMITTENT dorsal {{displacement}} of the soft palate is a common cause of acute respiratory obstruction in horses at maximal exercise, when the free border of the soft palate becomes dislodged from its normal subepiglottic position and the displaced soft palate obstructs the nasopharyngeal and laryngeal lumen, particularly during expiration. Affected horses often make abnormal, loud, vibrant respiratory noises (‘gurgling’), and are unable to continue fast exercise. The aetiology of the disorder is unknown {{and as a result}} a wide variety of conservative and surgical treatments have been advocated. They include the use of a tongue tie, a dropped or Australian noseband, staphylectomy, myectomy of the sternothyrohyoideus muscles, sternothyroid <b>tenectomy,</b> ventriculectomy, tension palatoplasty (Ahern procedure), epiglottal augmentation, thyrohyoid prosthesis and thermo-cautery (including laser cautery) of the soft palate. Many veterinary surgeons believe that some horses may recover spontaneously from the disorder, or that it may resolve as the horse matures or becomes fitter (Freeman 1990, Dugdale and Greenwood 1993, Holcombe and Ducharme 1999); however, these have never been substantiated by con-trolled studies. Similarly, several authors advocate the use of a tongue tie or strap as an effective method of preventing th...|$|E
40|$|Case series summary Three cats, Siamese or Siamese cross, were {{presented}} with a chronic thoracic limb weightbearing lameness. Previous anti-inflammatory administrations were unable to improve lameness consistently in the three cats. Two of the three cats had undergone onychectomy several years before presentation. A permanent flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint {{of one or more}} digits, associated with a difficult and painful extension of the proximal interphalangeal joint, was noticed during orthopedic examination. A digital flexor tendon contracture was suspected and confirmed with radiographic examination. Surgical exploration was then performed. For all cats, treatment consisted of a <b>tenectomy</b> or tenotomy of the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons in order to release the contracture. The three cats responded well to the surgical treatment and became sound around 2 – 4 weeks after surgery. Relevance and novel information Digital flexor tendon contracture is rarely reported as a cause of lameness in cats. It should be considered in a differential diagnosis of feline lameness whenever onychectomy has been performed in the past. The precise etiology that explains this tendon contracture is unknown, but trauma or breed predisposition could represent potential causes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since {{more than}} 50 years, various {{surgical}} procedures {{have been described}} for congenital Brown’s syndrome. However most showed low success rates and some even severe side effects. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of superior oblique posterior <b>tenectomy.</b> This technique was introduced in 1996 by Mühlendyck. Since this first description no other results have been published by others. Patients and methods: 21 patients with congenital Brown’s syndrome (aged 2 to 29 years) were operated between 2001 and 2006, in the Department of Ophthalmology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. In all patients, intraoperative forced ductions showed severe passive restriction of elevation in adduction and superior oblique posterior <b>tenectomy</b> was performed as a primary procedure. The squint angle (vertical and horizontal deviation in primary position, lateral gaze, up/down gaze), active elevation in adduction, abnormal head posture at distance fixation, binocular vision (in primary position and anomalous head posture) were assessed in each case. All the measurements were performed 1 day before, 1 month and 3 months after surgery. Eight patients were examined 6 - 24 months after primary procedure. Results: Intraoperatively, a tight or very tight posterior part of the superior oblique tendon was found in 87 % of operated eyes. At {{the end of the}} operation, passive motility in adduction became free (14 eyes) /almost free (7 eyes) on the majority of operated patients (totally 23 eyes). Inspite of free passive motility, the active monocular elevation in adduction was only slightly improved by 0. 5 mm to 5 mm (mean 2. 25 mm), like hypotropia in primary position, which was improved by 1 to 12 deg (mean 4 deg). Better results regarding hypotropia in primary position were noted when the preoperative vertical deviation in primary position was more than 10 deg. However in cases with preoperative hypotropia less than 10 deg, a better fusion was obtained. Preoperatively, 17 patients showed an abnormal head posture. Postoperatively, 12 of them totally gave up their posture and 5 improved partially. Of 8 cases with a long-term follow-up, 5 showed unchanged measurements of vertical deviation in primary position, monocular elevation in adduction and head posture. 3 patients with a long-term follow-up had further surgery and an improvement of vertical deviation in straight gaze and active elevation in adduction. Conclusion: The use of superior oblique posterior <b>tenectomy</b> significantly improves abnormal head posture and also improves alignment and ocular rotations in patients with congenital Brown’s syndrome. We did not see any serious side effect like consecutive superior oblique muscle underaction (as in superior oblique tenotomy or recession) and no foreign body extrusion (as in silicone superior oblique tendon expander). So the superior oblique posterior <b>tenectomy</b> is a safe and effective procedure with regard to the head posture. The fact that the passive motility had dramatic improved postoperatively, but the active elevation in adduction improved only slightly, suggests a paretic/ dysinnervational component to the superior oblique in some patients. From this point of view, a therapeutic algorithm depending on intraoperative/ radiological findings in congenital Brown’s syndrome is proposed. Hintergrund: Seit mehr als 50 Jahren, wird die schwierige, operative Behandlung des kongenitalen Brown-Syndroms kontrovers diskutiert. Ziel dieser retrospektiven Studie war die Bestimmung des Effektes der hintere Obliquus-superior-Tendektomie, die 1996 erstmals von Mühlendyck vorgestellt wurde und zu der bisher noch keine weiteren Daten publiziert wurden. Patienten und Methoden: Insgesamt wurden 21 Patienten (im Alter von 2 – 29 Jahren) in der Studie eingeschlossen, die wegen eines kongenitalen Brown-Syndroms in der Augenklinik der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München zwischen 2001 und 2006 operiert wurden. Bei allen Patienten war präoperativ die passive Hebung in Adduktion sehr deutlich eingeschränkt und es erfolgte eine hintere Obliquus-superior-Tendektomie. Die Schielwinkel wurden im Prismen-Abdecktest, die monokulare Exkursion nach Folgebewegungen, die Kopfzwangshaltung (KZH) bei Fernfixation, das Binokularsehen in Primärposition und in Kopfzwangshaltung bestimmt. Die Messungen erfolgten 1 Tag präoperativ, 1 Monat und 3 Monaten postoperativ. Acht Patienten erschienen zu einer Spätkontrolle nach 6 - 24 Monaten. Ergebnisse: Am Ende der Operation war die passive Hebung in Adduktion in meisten Fällen frei (bei 14 der 23 Augen) oder fast frei (bei 7 der 23 Augen). Trotz freier passiver Motilität, war die aktive Hebung in Adduktion nur wenig gebessert (0. 5 mm - 5 mm, Median 2. 25 mm), wie auch die vertikale Abweichung in Primärposition (1 ° - 12 °, Median 4 °). Eine stärkere Reduktion des Höhenschielen in Primärposition wurden beobachtet, wenn die vertikale Abweichung in Primärposition präoperativ über 10 ° war. Besser Binokularfunktion ergaben sich bei VD, die unter 10 ° war. Präoperativ, nahmen 17 Patienten eine Kopfzwangshaltung (KZH) ein. Postoperativ, haben alle 17 Patienten die KZH vollständig aufgegeben (12) oder nur noch eine geringe KZH eingenommen (5). Bei 5 der 8 Patienten mit einer späten Kontrolle hatten sich die vertikale Abweichung in Primärposition, die aktive Hebung in Adduktion und die KZH nicht geändert. Bei 3 Patienten ergab sich nach einer weiteren Operation eine deutliche Besserung. Schlussfolgerung: Die hintere Obliquus-superior-Tendektomie verbessert deutlich die Kopfzwangshaltung und reduziert das Höhenschielen in Primärposition und die Hebungsfähigkeit in Adduktion bei kongenitalem Brown-Syndroms. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Operationsverfahren ist sie eine sichere Methode ohne das Risiko der konsekutiven Obliquus-superior-Parese (wie bei der Tenotomie oder der Rücklagerung des gesamten Muskels) oder der Extrusion von Fremdmaterial (wie bei der Obliquus-superior-Sehnenverlängerung). Die Variabilität der Effekte dieser Therapie ist vermutlich auf die heterogene Ätiologie des Brown-Syndroms zurückzuführen. Die auch postoperativ stark eingeschränkte aktive Hebung bei passiv freier Motilität deutet auch eine paretische / dysinnervationelle Komponente bei einigen Fällen des kongenitalen Brown-Syndroms hin...|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe natural {{progression}} of neuromuscular diseases results in inevitable musculotendinous contractures, {{most often in}} spite of early treatment. Surgery corrects this. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the results of tendon surgery in these cases. Materials and methodsTwenty children with muscular dystrophy underwent hip surgery (tensor fascia lata <b>tenectomy,</b> rectus femoris and sartorius tenotomy), knee surgery (gracilis, semitendinosus and semimembranosus tenotomies) and/or ankle surgery (lengthening or tenotomy of the Achilles tendon with or without posterior tibial tendon transfer). Articular range of motion was evaluated preoperatively, 6 months after surgery, at 1 year and at the final follow-up (7. 4 years). ResultsThree children underwent surgery before they had lost their walking capacity, eight soon afterwards, and nine long afterwards. Surgery was bilateral in all cases: 38 hips, 12 knees and 36 ankles with 22 posterior tibial tendon transfers. Hip extension, which was limited by a 30 ° flexion contracture improved to 10 ° and stabilized at 14 ° at the final follow-up. Adduction which was − 19 ° before surgery increased to 35 ° and had stabilized at 32 ° at the final follow-up. Knee flessum (38 °) was only slightly improved (24 °) and had regressed at the final follow-up. Equinus deformity (42 °) was corrected to 9 ° of dorsal flexion with a slight loss (2 °) at the final follow-up. Varus was improved from 11 ° to 6 °, but this had regressed at 1 year (10 °) and at the final follow-up (11 °). Achilles tendon tenotomies resulted in 28 ° of dorsal flexion at 6 months compared to 20 ° with lengthening. Correction of varus was better with posterior tibial tendon transfer at 6 months, 1 year and at the final follow-up (11 ° versus 5 °). In the three patients who underwent surgery before losing their walking ability, one continued walking for 1 year and two for 6 months. None of the eight patients who underwent surgery soon after losing ambulation were able to regain walking. All patients were able to continue device assisted upright positioning for a mean 3 years. DiscussionHip and ankle surgery can release contractures. In the knees, surgery should be restricted to cases with knee flessum greater than 30 °. The best results are obtained with extensive m. tensor fascia lata <b>tenectomy</b> and posterior tibial tendon transfer. Achilles tendon tenotomy results in better recovery of dorsal flexion. Surgery is indicated when contractures are severe and the patient is no longer able to walk. The aim should not be to continue walking but to release contractures, so that the patient can continue assisted upright positioning as long as possible. Especially in cases of asymmetric contractures, surgery can help slow the {{progression of}} scoliosis...|$|E

40|$|Superior oblique myokymia (SOM) is {{characterized}} by intermittent, small-amplitude, monocular, paroxysmal, high-frequency oscillations. These oscillations are mainly torsional in the primary gaze position and in abduction and evoke oscillopsia during paroxysms (1). The term SOM was first used by Hoyt and Keane in 1970 (2), but the first case recognizable as SOM was described by Duane in 1906 (3). The pathophysiology of this condition is not clear. Often the patients are otherwise healthy, but sometimes vascular compression of cranial nerve IV may be responsible (4, 5), and rarely it is associated with other neurological diseases, such as adrenoleukodystrophy (6), retinitis pigmentosa, astrocytoma, multiple sclerosis and cerebellar tumour (7). The disorder may have spontaneous remissions, which can last for days or up to years, and relapses (1). There have been several reports that anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine, have a therapeutic effect (8, 9). In recent years, gabapentin has also {{been reported to be}} effective (10, 11). When medication is unsuccessful, surgery, involving tenotomy or a <b>tenectomy</b> of the superior oblique muscle, combined with inferior oblique myectomy may be performed (1). Recently, surgical decompression of cranial nerve IV {{has been found to be}} beneficial when vascular compression is con- firmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but there is the danger of superior oblique palsy (4). The choice of treatment is related to the intensity and duration of the visual symptoms and to the degree of disability the disorder may have caused. Pareja et al.

40|$|Tendon is {{a dynamic}} tissue whose {{structure}} and function is influenced by mechanical loading, but {{little is known about}} the fundamental mechanisms that regulate tendon growth and remodeling in vivo. Data from cultured tendon fibroblasts indicated that the p 38 MAPK pathway plays an important role in tendon fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in vitro. To gain greater insight into the mechanisms of tendon growth, and explore the role of p 38 MAPK signaling in this process, we tested the hypotheses that inducing plantaris tendon growth through the ablation of the synergist Achilles tendon would result in rapid expansion of a neotendon matrix surrounding the original tendon, and that treatment with the p 38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 would prevent this growth. Rats were treated with vehicle or SB 203580, and subjected to synergist ablation by bilateral <b>tenectomy</b> of the Achilles tendon. Changes in histological and biochemical properties of plantaris tendons were analyzed 3, 7, or 28 days after overload, and comparisons were made to non-overloaded animals. By 28 days after overload, tendon mass had increased by 30 % compared to non-overloaded samples, and cross-sectional area (CSA) increased by around 50 %, with most of the change occurring in the neotendon. The expansion in CSA initially occurred through the synthesis of a hyaluronic acid rich matrix that was progressively replaced with mature collagen. Pericytes were present in areas of active tendon growth, but never in the original tendon ECM. Inhibition of p 38 MAPK resulted in a profound decrease in IL 6 expression, and had a modest effect on the expression of other ECM and cell proliferation genes, but had a negligible impact on overall tendon growth. The combined results from this study provided novel insights into tendon mechanobiology, and suggest that p 38 MAPK signaling does not appear to be necessary for tendon growth in vivo...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether the decreased bone formation observed in most experimental situations of disuse {{was caused by}} an increased inhibition by the bone microenvironment of osteoblast (OB) proliferation, we studied the inhibiting power on ROS 17 / 2. 8 proliferation of the bone marrow extracellular fluid (IPEF) in loaded and unloaded bones of rats submitted to two situations of partial disuse: tail suspension (TS) for 3 days to 2 weeks and around the knee <b>tenectomy</b> (KT) for 2 - 10 weeks. Histomorphometric parameters and osteoblast precursors dynamics were studied in parallel. Bone volume {{was lost in the}} unloaded bones, but not in loaded bones, in both experimental situations. Bone formation was low at early times (7 - 14 days) in TS rats. However, in KT at later times (4 - 10 weeks), the osteoblastic index of the unloaded tibia was increased. IPEF was not increased in the unloaded bones 3 - 7 days after TS. It was decreased later in the course of unloading (after 2 weeks of TS and 2 - 10 weeks after KT). This decrease was observed in the loaded bones as well. Unexpectedly, we also found that the number of FCFUs was decreased in both loaded and unloaded limbs in TS and KT, and that the yield of cells obtained in primary culture from tibial metaphysis was decreased in both tibiae from KT animals. These data show that an increased IPEF does not {{play a role in the}} early inhibition of bone formation responsible for the loss of bone after unloading in the TS model. Its later decrease could be permissive for the increased osteoblastic index observed in the KT model. They also show that, contrary to the usual assumptions, bone biology is changed all over the skeleton after partial unloading, even if the changes result in bone loss in the unloaded bones only. Thus, as yet, unidentified systemic factors probably superimpose on the local factors that control bone volume. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.
