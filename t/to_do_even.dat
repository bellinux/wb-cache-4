In a move that turned out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>even</b> more damage, the network moved Match Game to its 1960s timeslot of 4:00pm, a time slot which by this point many local stations were preempting in favor of local or syndicated programming. As a result, Match Game was unable to get the audience it once did in the 1960s at 4:00.|$|E

[...] Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the [...] "unforgivable things" [...] she has done (especially her devious move of letting them believe she was dead). Jones further said: [...] "Some will say she did what she thought she had <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Even</b> though it seemed as if it was easy, it's never that easy {{to walk away from the}} people you love".|$|E

500|$|The PCMR's {{power to}} review and block the passage of Bills is {{regarded}} by some {{as an indication of}} its potential as a second chamber. The Council's functional design, however, makes it only a very weak legislative review mechanism. The Council has no power to investigate alleged breaches of minority rights. The general public has also no right of making their views or complaints known to the Chamber. In addition, the lack of a veto power means that currently the most the Council can do is delay the passage of bills and prompt further parliamentary deliberation of the bills in question. But it has yet <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>even</b> this much. On those occasions where the Council might have rightly drawn attention to differentiating measures in proposed Bills, the legislature has pre-empted this by inserting [...] "notwithstanding clauses" [...] in the Constitution. Such clauses declare that laws that contravene a constitutional provision are nevertheless valid.|$|E

Spurred on by the desire <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>even</b> more, she approached the government {{for a piece of}} land to expand her old folks' home. The Ministry of Health gave her a [...] plot in Woodlands, on which she oversaw the building of a new home. To help in raising funds for its construction, she published a recipe book called Top 100 Vegetarian Delights in 1998, which brought in more than S$100,000 (U$66,667). In August 2001, the new four-storey building was opened at Woodlands Street 82. It houses nearly 235sick and elderly and provides residential, rehabilitation, and day-care services. The home is open to all regardless of age, gender, race or religion. It regularly organises in-house activities such as cooking, hand-craft, karaoke, and games, as well as visits to places of interest and participation in various community events. The original home is now a Buddhist temple, the Lin Chee Cheng Sia Temple.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>even</b> though the game is always telling you what to do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E

500|$|Until season five's [...] "Cyborg", the DC Comics superheroes who {{had paid}} Clark a visit {{on the show}} were {{all members of the}} Justice League of America, but Gough and Miller felt that Victor Stone shared a [...] "relatable dilemma" [...] with Clark—the fact that both Victor and Clark's {{abilities}} {{get in the way of}} their romantic relationships with the women they love—and was someone the developers felt was just an interesting character. Victor normally goes by the alias [...] "Cyborg" [...] and is a member of the Teen Titans in the comics. Casting Lee Thompson Young was something the producers had always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>even</b> before they had decided to bring in Cyborg. The actor revealed that his first contact with the Cyborg character came not from the comics, but from the Teen Titans animated television series. According to Young, he was fortunate that this version of Victor Stone was Smallvilles spin on the character, and as such, the majority of the character's background was in the script. While preparing, Young expressed his pleasure in the fact that the producers decided to keep Victor's robotic parts internal, as opposed to the comic version, where half of Cyborg's visible body is covered in metal.|$|E

Garzelli took the climb, and the Passo Fedaia that followed, and maintained first position on the road well into the stage-concluding climb, but Nieve eventually caught and passed him with [...] left to race. Nieve won the stage, and as he approached the finish line he attempted to raise his arms in a gesture of triumph, but he found himself too fatigued <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>even</b> that.

Three weeks later in the San Marino Grand Prix, Irvine would miss out on another podium finish, after his car suffered an engine failure on lap 47 (of 62) while in a comfortable third place, losing him the lead of the Drivers' Championship to teammate Schumacher. Irvine finished second at Monaco, behind Schumacher, giving Ferrari its first one-two finish of the season, and first ever in the Principality.

I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>even</b> better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it.

2500|$|Though the {{administration}} had achieved the desired result, it was a pyrrhic victory, as Carranza's lieutenant, Pancho Villa, presented a more serious threat in 1916. [...] In early 1916 Pancho Villa raided Columbus, an American town in New Mexico, killing eighteen Americans and causing an enormous nationwide demand for his punishment. Wilson ordered Gen. John Pershing and 4000 troops into northern Mexico to capture Villa, which they were unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>even</b> as Pershing continued his pursuit deep into Mexico. [...] President Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused them of a punitive invasion. However tensions subsided and bilateral negotiations began. The issue had become a possible war with Germany so Wilson ended Pershing's diversion into Mexico in February 1917. In January, Germany's foreign minister sent Mexico the Zimmermann Telegram inviting it to join in war against the United States. Washington learned of the Zimmermann proposal on [...] February 23 and détente with Mexico was essential. Wilson accorded Carranza diplomatic recognition in April, after Congress declared war on Germany. Biographer Arthur Link calls it Carranza's victory—his successful handling of the chaos inside Mexico, as well as over Wilson's policies. Mexico was now free to develop its revolution without American pressure. Pershing became a national figure. Wilson selected him to command the American forces being sent to fight in France.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 April 1797, Colonel Thomas Maitland of the Sixty-second Foot {{regiment}} {{landed in}} Port-au-Prince, and {{wrote in a}} letter to his brother that British forces in St. Domingue had been [...] "annihilated" [...] by the yellow fever. Service in St. Domingue was extremely unpopular in the British Army owing to terrible death toll caused by yellow fever with one British officer writing of his horror of seeing his friends [...] "drowned in their own blood" [...] while [...] "some died raving Mad". Simcoe used the new British troops to push back the Haitians under Toussaint, but in a counter-offensive, Toussaint and Rigaud stopped the offensive with Toussaint retaking the fortress at Mirebalais. On 7 June 1797, Toussaint attacked Fort Churchill in an assault that was noted for its professionalism as it for its ferocity. Under a storm of artillery, the Haitians placed ladders on the walls and were driven back after four times with heavy losses. Even through Toussaint had been defeated, the British were astonished that Toussaint had turned a group of former slaves with no military experience into troops whose skills were the equal of a European army. In July 1797, Simcoe and Maitland sailed to London to advise a total withdrawal from St. Domingue, a thesis that was so persuasive by this point that in March 1798 Maitland returned with a mandate to withdraw, at least from Port-au-Prince. On 10 May 1798, Maitland met with Toussaint to agree to an armistice, and on 18 May the British had left Port-au-Prince. British morale had collapsed with the news that Toussaint had taken Port-au-Prince, and Maitland decided to abandon all of St. Domingue, writing that the expedition had become such a complete disaster that withdrawal was the only sensible thing <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>even</b> through he did not have the authority to do so. On 31 August, Maitland and Toussaint signed an agreement where in exchange for pulling out all of St. Domingue, Toussaint promised to not support any slave revolts in Jamaica. Between 1793–98, the expedition to St. Domingue had cost the British treasury four million pounds and 100, 000 men either dead or crippled from the effects of yellow fever.|$|E
