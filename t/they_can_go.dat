5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E

Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used.

Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees.

25|$|The Pro-Rand forces {{fight their}} way in, but against far {{superior}} numbers they're only able to penetrate so far before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> no further.

Research in Oman has found grasses of the genus Stipagrostis are primarily taken; flowers from Stipagrostis plants appeared highest in crude protein and water, while leaves seemed a better food source with other vegetation.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of river-going traffic next to Shad Thames. It is part of the {{particularly}} deep section of river called the Pool of London, which even ships can navigate. So from time to time even full-size cruise ships or naval vessels will stop next to Shad Thames, usually for a day or so, often then proceeding through Tower Bridge (though <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> no further than the next crossing, London Bridge). Police boats and speedboats pass by frequently, as do passenger boats (such as the Damien Hirst-decorated 'Tate to Tate' boat), and yachts from St Katharine Docks {{on the north side of}} the river opposite Shad Thames.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Defense's Defense Logistics Agency {{is charged}} with off-loading 13,000 MRAPs to 780 {{domestic}} law enforcement agencies on waiting lists for vehicles. The DLA does not transfer property to the agencies, so the vehicles are allocated to the agencies with costs picked up by them or the state, while the vehicles remain {{the property of the}} Defense Department. To receive an armored vehicle, a requesting agency has to meet certain criteria, including justification for use (such as for shooting incidents, SWAT operations and drug interdiction), geographical area and multi-jurisdiction use, the ability to pay for repairs and maintenance, and security and restricted access to the vehicle. Police departments and other agencies in the U.S. can acquire MRAP vehicles through the DLA's 1033 program, which redistributes no longer needed military equipment to state and municipal agencies. Some police departments have picked up surplus MRAPs with no transfer costs or fees. Domestic agencies plan to use them in disaster relief roles, as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> through flooded areas unlike normal police armored vehicles, and provide security in response to terrorist threats. Some MRAPs used by police forces often have the machine gun turret removed and are repainted black.|$|E
25|$|Like black widows, {{the female}} S. grossa is 6-10.5mm {{in length and}} dark colored with a round, bulbous abdomen. Typical {{coloration}} ranges from purplish brown to black, with light-colored markings. Unlike black widows, redbacks, and other Latrodectus species, S. grossa {{does not have a}} bright red hourglass pattern or any other bright markings. Like many spiders, the male is sometimes smaller but can many times be nearly as long as the females. It measures 4.1-10.0mm in length and is thinner than the female. The two sexes are colored similarly; however, the sexually mature male almost always has lighter, more reddish-coloured legs than the female. S. grossa spiders may shed up to six times (instars) before reaching maturity. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> several months without feeding, provided they have access to water. A well-fed female can lay three or more egg sacs each year. Each egg sac typically contains between 40-100 eggs. The mother can often be observed watching her eggs for hours, even days, at a time once the eggs start changing color and grow close to hatching. At normal household temp/humidity, an egg will usually hatch within a month of being laid. The spiderlings are independent from time of hatch.|$|E
50|$|Lady Sylvia {{volunteers to}} {{introduce}} Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) and Constable Dexter (Ron Webster) to everyone so that <b>they</b> then <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to sleep.

5000|$|Rooks {{are among}} the three pieces that <b>can</b> [...] "fly". <b>They</b> <b>can</b> move on, to, and from the higher level. A rook can make a normal move {{on any of the}} two levels: note that the squares it passes over must be empty on the level he moves in. Additionally, a rook <b>can</b> <b>go</b> up when moving on the ground level by making a normal move and then moving diagonally up in the {{direction}} the rook moves. <b>They</b> also <b>can</b> <b>go</b> up directly one level. The only way a rook <b>can</b> <b>go</b> down from the upper to the lower level is to directly move one square down.|$|R
25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
