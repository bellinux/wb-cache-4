5|$|The Universe is all {{of space}} and time (spacetime) and its contents, which {{includes}} planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space and all matter and energy. While the size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe. Halpern and Tomasello calculated <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe using data from European Space Agency's Planck satellite, estimating it to be 90.68 billion light-years across, 0.7% smaller then previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} {{of matter and}} energy throughout <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure {{and the evolution of}} the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants that appear to be static across <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe. The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.|$|E

40|$|Consider a model whose {{structure}} is representable via recursive graph or Bayes network {{and in which}} both observable and unobservable variables are involved.

However, if we may give predictions in terms of class or category rather than probability, then we may not have to know the exact details of the model. It is shown in this article that when <b>the</b> <b>observables</b> are conditionally independent and conditionally stochastically ordered given the unobservables, the unobservables are conditionally ordered given <b>the</b> <b>observables.</b> This result suggests to some extent robustness of the conditional probabilities of <b>the</b> <b>observables</b> given <b>the</b> unobservables, and the simulation result strongly supports the suggestion...|$|R
5|$|A related {{issue to}} the classic horizon problem arises because in most {{standard}} cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should {{not be able to}} prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.|$|E
5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> Universe, and one—oxygen—makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new scheme of {{defining}} invariant observables for general relativistic systems.

5|$|Matter is {{commonly}} {{defined as the}} substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 {{percent of the total}} mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy. The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} lightest element and {{is the second}} most {{abundant}} in <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created {{as a result of the}} nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, the Schrödinger picture (also {{called the}} Schrödinger representation) is a {{formulation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} {{in which the state}} vectors evolve in time, but <b>the</b> operators (<b>observables</b> and others) are constant with respect to time. This differs from the Heisenberg picture which keeps the states constant while <b>the</b> <b>observables</b> evolve in time, and from the interaction picture in which both the states and <b>the</b> <b>observables</b> evolve in time. The Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures are related as active and passive transformations and commutation relations between operators are preserved in the passage between the two pictures.|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> {{characteristics of}} an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E

5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of <b>the</b> <b>observable</b> Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} monopole objection {{was raised in}} the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as {{magnetic monopole}}s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found.
