However, the 2008 general election resulted in a change of government. In June 2009, Attorney-General Hon Christopher Finlayson announced that the title of Queen's Counsel would be reinstated, and a bill to implement the restoration was introduced into Parliament in March 2010.

500|$|The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering was {{published}} in 2000. Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit {{the memory of the}} Holocaust as an [...] "ideological weapon." [...] The purpose, writes Finkelstein, is to enable the State of Israel, [...] "one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, [...] cast itself as a victim state;" [...] that is, to provide Israel [...] "immunity to criticism." [...] He alleges what he calls a [...] "double shakedown" [...] by [...] "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" [...] seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, moneys which then go to <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> institutional actors involved in procuring them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors.|$|E
500|$|Allan Bakke {{had given}} few {{interviews}} during the pendency of the case, {{and on the}} day it was decided, went to work as usual in Palo Alto. He issued a statement through attorney Colvin expressing his pleasure in the result and that he planned to begin his medical studies that fall. Most of <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> university personnel who would {{have to deal with the}} aftermath of Bakke doubted the decision would change very much. [...] The large majority of affirmative action programs at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid numerical quotas for minority admissions and could continue. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of Bakke, the Supreme Court's decision [...] "permits admission officers to operate programs which grant racial preferences—provided that they do not do so as blatantly as was done under the sixteen-seat 'quota' provided at Davis".|$|E
500|$|On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston {{agreed to}} {{distribute}} the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, [...] "We {{made a deal with}} the devil, , and I guess that, in a way, we got what we deserved." [...] They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),—and after Skaaren, <b>the</b> <b>lawyers,</b> <b>and</b> the accountants were paid—only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjustedn) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.|$|E

500|$|The {{chemical}} companies involved denied {{that there was}} a link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems. However, on May 7, 1984, seven {{chemical companies}} settled the class-action suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin. The companies agreed to pay $180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them. Slightly over 45% of the sum was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone. Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. [...] "Fairness Hearings" [...] were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions of <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was [...] "fair and just". By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as food stamps, public assistance, and government pensions. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.|$|E
500|$|In March 1599, Devereux {{was sent}} to defeat the growing {{rebellion}} in Ireland and was given command of 18,000men, but by November his army was reduced to 4,000, the rest [...] "frittered away" [...] in exchange for [...] " [...] nothing". On 5 June 1600 he faced a panel of Privy Councillors, judges {{and members of the}} nobility at York House, where he was charged with appointing generals without the Queen's permission, ignoring orders and negotiating [...] "very basely" [...] with the leader of the rebel forces. While the members of the nobility wished to be gentle with Devereux, <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> judges felt differently, recommending fines and confinement in the Tower of London. In the end a compromise was reached, with Devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices. Devereux immediately began plotting rebellion. Orders were sent out for [...] "bedding" [...] and [...] "draperies"– codenames for weapons– and rebellious gentlemen gathered at Essex House to hear him talk of Elizabeth's [...] "crooked mind and crooked carcass". In response, Coke and Cecil began a counter-plot. In 1599 Sir John Hayward had written and published The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IV, dedicating it to Devereux. Elizabeth, furious, had banned the book, suggesting that it was a [...] "seditious prelude" [...] intended to show her as a corrupt and poor monarch. Against the backdrop of Devereux's plot, Coke and Cecil started a new investigation into the book, hoping to prove some involvement of Devereux in the publishing. Coke interviewed Hayward's licensing cleric, Samuel Harsnett, who complained that the dedication had been [...] "foisted" [...] on him by Devereux. In reaction, Coke decided to bring charges of treason against Devereux, saying that he had [...] "plotted and practised with the Pope and king of Spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of England... His permitting underhand that treasonable book of Henry IV to be printed and published; it being plainly deciphered, not only by the matter, and by the epistle itself, for what end and for whose behalf it was made, but also the Earl himself being present so often at the playing thereof, and with great applause giving countenance to it".|$|E

[...] <b>The</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> bankers who had organized the merger—notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary—were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble.

2500|$|The Know Nothing {{movement}} {{formed a}} new party in 1854 and captured {{almost all the}} seats in the legislature, the state government, and many cities. [...] Historian John Mulkern finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile to wealth, elites, and to expertise, and deeply suspicious of outsiders especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig party was strongest in high income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor districts. They voted out the traditional upper-class closed political leadership class, especially <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> merchants. In their stead they elected working class men, farmers, and a large number of teachers and ministers. Replacing the moneyed elite were men who seldom owned $10,000 in property.|$|E

The lawyers wanted to meet the accused alone, however, they had moved an application stating that police did {{not allow them to}} meet their clients alone and that the Court should direct the police not to remain present while they were talking to the accused. The Metropolitan Magistrate countered that it was not possible as police had to be with the accused. He is said to have hinted at collusion between <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> the accused, causing a walk out by the accused's lawyers.

He expressed his desire to write a statement expressing his feelings on the matter, and after hearing what he would possibly say in such a statement, Glaser agreed to the idea, although Ross was initially reluctant. O'Brien went without sleep that night, crafting his statement obsessively. He returned to the studio the following morning, listening as <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>and</b> Glaser read over the statement (it remained largely unchanged before publication). According to The War for Late Night, Glaser found [...] "the statement as ideal for their purposes. It laid out Conan’s point of view unequivocally, but without compromising his legal options. Nothing in there overtly said he was quitting, so he could not be accused of forsaking his contractual obligations." ...|$|E

That night, Laura and Adam both agree they don't [...] "… like Daddy not being here with us,", as he has been living elsewhere during the separation. The next morning, Dan visits Laura, signing how he misses his best friend. Laura, too, admits to wanting her best friend back. While they both have clearly established their standpoint on whether Adam should get the cochlear implant, they agree their son needs both of them, just like they need each other. Dan says he doesn't thnk they need a judge to choose what's best for them. Laura says whatever choices they make, they will make together as a family.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{electric}} {{pumping station}} was erected {{at a new}} outfall for <b>the</b> <b>Lawyers</b> <b>and</b> Andersons districts in 1949, {{to be followed by}} several more. The Fleet Haven pumping station cost £21,793 and was completed in 1958/59, and in the same year, Dawsmere pumping station cost £33,868. Lord's Drain pumping station commenced operation in 1962. Sluices were also upgraded, with that on the Holbeach River being commissioned in 1955, and the Lutton Leam outfall sluice following in 1958/59. Despite the improvements, the Fleet Fen area was found to be at risk during flood periods, and a major upgrade, funded by the government, was completed in 1971. It included a new pumping station where the Main Drain and the Fleet River meet, and used submersible pumps {{for the first time in}} a land drainage scheme. Extremely heavy rainfall on 11 July 1968, when over [...] fell on Gedney in the early morning, demonstrated that still more work was required to prevent flooding. Run-off water from Spalding was diverted into the Coronation Channel, a flood-relief bypass for the River Welland, and Clay Lake pumping station was built in 1970, which handles the run-off, but can also be used to pump the adjacent fen when it is not doing so. Five additional pumping stations were built throughout the district. More than half of the area served by the IDB now depends on pumping stations, although most stations still have a gravity outfall, so that power failures or breakdowns are not disastrous. A further six pumping stations have been commissioned since 1974, the latest being brought on-line in July 2003 at Lawyers Sluice, to assist when the 1949-built structure is tidelocked.|$|E
