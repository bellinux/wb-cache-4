2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been the same person again." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} even <b>think.</b> <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be alone for that.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the later}} {{suggestions}} went against Susan's grain. Had {{it not been}} for father's decree I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> snapped her fingers at Sir Robert Borden.|$|E
60|$|Meaning, I <b>think,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to get {{permission}} of her Voices first.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} spoken to my aunt about it, but I do not <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{contented}} to hear that you were to become the wife of Mr. Twentyman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course he'll give it. I've a {{right to}} {{it as much as}} Augusta." [...] There was {{something}} in Gertrude's face as she said this which made her mother <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> her way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left no {{word for}} me,' said Lucy, who {{knew she had}} been kinder than her wont, and was really wounded. 'Happy wife! Who can it be?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure {{my mother}} wouldn't wish {{me to have}} {{anything}} to do with her. I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> let me come here if she had known what sort of girl she is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's a pity,' said Steerforth. 'If you had had one, I should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a pretty, timid, little, bright-eyed sort of girl. I {{should have}} liked to know her. Good night, young Copperfield.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> your {{companionship}} than {{a part of}} your salary, Clorinda," [...] said Aunt Emmy. [...] "But {{of course}} you must decide for yourself, dear. It is hard to be poor. I know it. I am poor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It is {{four miles}} nearer than Ballyhovey, {{so we thought}} that {{we might as well}} meet you here, and more comfortably than meeting you in the town. It was Mary's suggestion. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> liked to have kissed Terence in the public street." ...|$|R
60|$|Had it {{not been}} {{that she did not}} dare to do that for the son which she had refused to the mother, I <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given way. As it was, she {{did not know how to}} yield, after having persevered so long.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She says, {{perhaps not}} unjustly, that Miss Charlecote overdid things with him, {{and that this}} is reaction. She observes keenly. If she would only <b>think!</b> <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been perfect had her father lived, to work on her by affection.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How divinely young!" [...] said Colville. [...] "Well," [...] he added, [...] "I {{wish that}} French lady could have overheard us, Miss Graham. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{changed her mind}} about Americans {{striking}} the note of personality in their talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{surprised}} that the last should have done so. Anne Marston is such a meek, quiet, peace-loving person, that I should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred remaining, as she naturally might have done, without exciting remark, with her own mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{have you}} not sworn to her {{again and again that}} she should be your wife? Do you <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done for you what she has done, had you not so sworn? Lord Scroope, I cannot think that you really mean it." [...] She put both her hands softly upon his arm and looked up to him imploring his mercy.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{official}} teaser {{clips from}} the film were released on YouTube to the buildup and throughout the documentary's release in July by Altitude Film and A24, including clips of Winehouse talking about how she felt about depression, how <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> handled fame from her early years, when she was recording her album Back to Black with her record producer Mark Ronson in March 2006 {{and when she was}} videotaped singing the [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] song at the fourteenth birthday party of her friend, Lauren Gilbert, in 1998 which received over one million views after 48 hours. In May 2015, the first teaser clip {{from the film}} was released. The short clip features a candid moment of Winehouse messing around with the camera and singing, while Nick Shymanksy, a member of her management team, recalls the beginning of her songwriting process; the video concludes with an unheard track Winehouse had recorded, [...] "Detachment", which was arranged to be on her album Back To Black (2006).|$|R
6000|$|... 'At Frankfort, a {{fortnight}} after we parted with him. It was a dreadful shock to her; {{and if it}} {{had happened in the}} house, I do not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> recovered it. Was it {{a fortnight}}? Yes, I know it was; for it was on the 3rd of September that I had your papa's letter. We were going to a party at Prince K--'s, where there was to be a celebrated Italian improvisatrice, and I would not give her the letter till the next morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone to Aylmer Castle,--though I {{dare say}} {{it is the best}} thing she could do. She seemed to me to dislike the Aylmers,--that is, Lady Aylmer,--so much! But I suppose she is right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has always}} desired the marriage. And yet I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{satisfied}} {{had it been}} otherwise. But of course her heart must be with her brother. I need not have troubled myself to go to Blankenberg after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jaquetta {{was always}} ready to be delighted. Dear child, her head was full of log huts and Robinson Crusoe life, and cows to milk herself; and I really <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked to go ashore in the Swiss family's eight tubs! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, in {{the first}} place mother did not know anyone who had to do with ships; and then her friends were all here, and she knew the place and its ways, and she thought that by buying a bawley, as she has done, in time I should come to sail her and earn my living as my uncle does. And then I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> agreed to my going to sea right away from her; but I do not know about that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What was the {{use when}} she told me plainly that she did not care for me? Of course I should have asked her father. As to Lady Staveley, she and I got on uncommonly well. I'm almost {{inclined}} to <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> objected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{fallen in}} love with her middle-aged guardian?" [...] he exclaimed with a harsh, sarcastic laugh. [...] "That girl? ... with her head full of romantic {{nonsense}} ... and I ... in ragged doublet, with a bald head, and an evil temper ... Bah!!! ... But," [...] he added, with an unpleasant sneer, [...] "'tis unselfish and disinterested on your part, my dear Editha, even to suggest it. Sue does not like you. Her being mistress here would not be conducive to your comfort." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{we liked}} Miss Ponsonby and we pitied her. She confided {{to us that}} she was very lonely and that she wrote poetry. We never asked to see the poetry, {{although}} I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked to show it. But, as Jerry says, there are limits.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; Mr. Wilmot and I {{persuaded her}} into it; but I do not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> allowed it, {{if she had}} seen the {{application}} we made of it--the gift of her girlhood blessed and extended. Dear King Etheldred, it is the only time I ever cheated her." ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{tingling}} {{with delight}} at this freedom, {{and she knew}} she was not fit for its responsibility. She just came short of a passionate refusal of his proposal. He was still so new to her, and things were so wonderful, or I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made that refusal.|$|E
6000|$|... "And with it my heart," [...] {{answered}} Sophia. Nor as {{she spoke}} did she hesitate for a moment, or become embarrassed, or lose her command of feature. Had Augustus Staveley gone through the same ceremony at Noningsby {{in the same way}} I am inclined to <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made the same answer. Had neither done so, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not on that account have been unhappy. What a blessed woman <b>would</b> Lady Staveley <b>have</b> been had she known what was being done in Harley Street at this moment! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hate it!' said Lady Merrifield; 'but I suppose I ought! However, there's {{no harm in}} this, that's a comfort; it {{is simply}} that the gentleman that the house is let to has found this note to her somewhere about, and <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> wish to <b>have</b> it. I think it is her mother's hand. How nice of him!' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{intervals}} of their talk and silence there came vivid flashes of lightning and quite heavy shocks of thunder, very consoling to our friends, who took them {{as so many}} compliments to their prudence in not going by the boat, and who had secret doubts of their wisdom whenever these acknowledgments were withheld. Isabel {{went so far as}} to say that <b>she</b> hoped nothing <b>would</b> happen to the boat, but I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> cheerfully <b>have</b> learnt that the vessel had been obliged to put back to Newport, on account of the storm, or even that it had been driven ashore at a perfectly safe place.|$|R
6000|$|MORELL (boldly and steadily). When Candida {{promised to}} marry me, I {{was the same}} moralist and windbag that you now see. I wore my black coat; and my collar was buttoned behind instead of in front. Do you <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> loved me any the better for being insincere in my profession? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' {{said the}} old man, patting her on the head, and {{speaking}} as affectionately {{as if she had}} been his favourite child. 'Poor dear! what do you think of this, brother Ned? Madeline has only written to her once, only once, Ned, and she didn't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> forgotten her quite so soon, Ned.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Harry {{said with}} a laugh, [...] "I do <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the better {{of you in the}} future if you didn't. So you see you will be both conquering your superstitions--she, because her curiosity is greater; you, because you are more afraid of her tongue than you are of the demons." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{second letter}} agreeably {{surprised}} him. It {{was announced that}} the writer {{had just returned from}} the United States; it invited him to dinner that evening; and it was signed [...] "Randal Linley." [...] In Mr. Sarrazin's estimation, Randal had always occupied a higher place than his brother. The lawyer had known Mrs. Linley before her marriage, and had been inclined to <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done wisely if she had given her hand to the younger brother instead of the elder. His acquaintance with Randal ripened rapidly into friendship. But his relations with Herbert made no advance toward intimacy: there was a gentlemanlike cordiality between them, and nothing more.|$|R
5000|$|On July 2, 2010 Elijah asks Blair {{to marry}} him. She then tells him she needs time to [...] "think." [...] They go to Tahiti where they run into Ross Rayburn. They {{were about to}} marry until Blair found out what Eli did. She shoots him, but the bullets are blanks. When Blair returns to Llanview, she is saddened to learn Tea has died. Blair makes Tea the funeral <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted. In October, it is {{discovered}} Eli and Tea are alive. Eli comes back to Llanview and kidnaps Starr, Hope, and Dani. They go to Cherryvale to treat Eli, but in the staircases Eli finds Tea and takes her as well. Starr and Hope escape Eli are kidnapped once again by Hannah O'Connor (Meghann Fahy). Todd, Blair, John, and Bo (Robert S. Woods) face off with Eli at the warehouse. Eli wants Blair to run away with him so she listens and gets into the van, but sneakily leaves and goes in the warehouse looking for Starr and Hope. Instead, she is shocked to find Tea in the warehouse, and alive. Tea and Blair share an emotional reunion. Blair unties Tea and tells her they have to run because Eli will blow up the warehouse. Eli notices Blair is gone and blows up the warehouse with Tea and Blair inside it. Blair and Tea pick themselves up {{and try to find}} a way to get out of the warehouse. Todd and John go into the warehouse and try to find Blair and possibly Hope and Starr. Tea and Blair find John and Todd. They are all rescued.|$|R
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never thought she could get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> time to really <b>think</b> about how <b>she</b> looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|R
