5|$|The {{unpredictability of}} the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem.

The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Actors John Carson and Geoffrey Keen provide guest {{speaking}} roles, with {{additions to}} the regular voice cast {{in the form of}} Keith Alexander and Gary Files. The design of the puppets that appear in Thunderbird 6 marks a transition between the caricatures that Century 21 had used up to Thunderbirds Are Go and the realism introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. Filming ran from May to December 1967, and <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> special effects departments collaborated to realise Skyship One as both a miniature model and a collection of themed interior designs. A number of sequences of the Tiger Moth in flight were filmed on location with a full-sized stunt plane, but a legal dispute with the Ministry of Transport regarding alleged dangerous flying by pilot Joan Hughes forced the production team to film the remaining shots in-studio with scale replicas.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did not use}} the 3D {{graphics}} which Armok {{had since}} its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, mix it together and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game.|$|E
5|$|Carpet weaving {{represents}} a traditional art, {{dating back to}} pre-Islamic times. During its long history, <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, Turkic peoples migrating from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or migrating to Anatolia, brought with them their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam {{and the development of}} the Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Abbe began {{learning}} judo from Kazohira Nakamoto, {{a former}} police officer. That same year, {{he was promoted to}} the rank of 1st dan in <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>and,</b> unusually, he reached 2nd dan the next year, and 3rd dan the year after that. Thus, at the age of 16, he became the youngest judo student ever promoted to 3rd dan—an honour he received directly from Shohei Hamano, an instructor of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (abbreviated to 'Butoku Kai' or 'Butokukwai'), which was the official governing body for Japanese martial arts. Abbe also became champion of the Tokushima High School Judo League that year. During his fifth year at the school, Abbe entered a regional tournament involving 30 towns, serving as captain for the team from the town of Kawashima. His speed and agility helped him to many victories, and he received the nickname 'Pegasus' accordingly.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of <b>the</b> <b>art,</b> <b>and</b> in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E
