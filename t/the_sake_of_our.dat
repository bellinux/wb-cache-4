There were many times when the Japanese conducted zonifications in the town. The barrios of Paliparan and Salawag suffered the most number of deaths. Being remote places and thinking that guerrillas were hiding there, these two barrios were zonified two times giving up several lives. The Japanese Imperial Army made the schools as their garrison.|$|E

Seenivasagam of the PPP accused the Alliance of using Article 153 to [...] "bully non-Malays", while Ong Kee Hui of the Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP) said that [...] "We see an attitude of intolerance and mounting signs of denial of political equality {{to people who are}} non-Malays.

500|$|The Florida recount {{was stopped}} {{a few weeks}} later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be {{completed}} by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, [...] "for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession." ...|$|E

Treatment of a fractional derivative operator has been made associated with the extended Appell hypergeometric functions of two variables and Lauricella hypergeometric function of three variables. With a view on analytic properties and application of new Riemann–Liouville type fractional derivative operator, we have obtained new fractional derivative formulas for some familiar functions and for Mellin transformation formulas. For <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> justification <b>of</b> <b>our</b> new operator, we have established some presumably new generating functions for an extended hypergeometric function using the new definition of fractional derivative operator.|$|R

However, {{it was not clear}} why the money was given to him, though it was alleged that he was talking to Mr Saklawi about the redevelopment of an [...] council-owned carpark. Tsang had previously released a statement that [...] "Councils need to take leadership roles in this area, we simply cannot continue to support unsustainable development, for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> children, grandchildren and the future environment, we need to make changes now." [...] According to The Australian Tsang was heard to have said that [...] "Basically, we get it for nothing,..... I am making Strathfield a better place ... I am doing it for the area." [...] Strathfield council soon afterwards released a press statement that it [...] "will not and does not" [...] tolerate misconduct. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is currently investigating whether claims developers were given inside information about land rezoning proposals put to Strathfield Council have any substance and the pictures taken by The Australian were handed to them for further investigation.|$|E

In a speech given in June 2005 to the Ohio State Highway Patrol Academy he reiterated his belief that key provisions should be reauthorized, and that [...] "The Patriot Act has accomplished {{exactly what it was}} designed to do: it has protected American liberty and saved American lives. For <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> national security, Congress must not rebuild a wall between law enforcement and intelligence." [...] However, by this time the Act was as controversial as ever, {{and more than a few}} groups were campaigning against it. Aside from the EFF, the ACLU, the CDT and the EPIC, the Act had raised the ire of the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Booksellers Foundation for Freedom of Expression, who were all extremely concerned about the provisions of the Patriot Act, with a particular focus on section 215. An even more disparate group called the [...] "Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances" [...] (or PRCB) had also been formed to campaign against the Act, and were urging Congress to let the sections expire. Many unlikely bedfellows formed this group, and those numbered in its membership including the ACLU, the American Conservative Union, Gun Owners of America, and the United States Libertarian Party. The group had also supported the SAFE Act.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a linear Hamiltonian Difference System {{for the so-called}} singular case so that discrete Sturm–Liouville Equations of higher order are included in our theory. We introduce the concepts of focal points for matrix-valued and generalized zeros for vector-valued solutions {{of the system and}} define disconjugacy for linear Hamiltonian Difference Systems. We prove a Reid Roundabout Theorem which gives conditions equivalent to positive definiteness of a certain discrete quadratic functional, among them the strengthened Jacobi's Condition and a condition on a certain Riccati Difference Equation. The key to this theorem is a discrete version of Picone's Identity. Furthermore, for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> generalization <b>of</b> <b>our</b> theorem, we introduce controllability for linear Hamiltonian Difference Systems and prove a Reid Roundabout Theorem for a more general functional and more general boundary conditions...|$|R
