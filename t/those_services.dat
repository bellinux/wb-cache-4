5|$|Stretford {{was part}} of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for <b>those</b> <b>services.</b> The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, {{as a result of the}} Local Government Act 1894.|$|E
5|$|On termination, the Menominee, {{which was}} one of the wealthiest tribes prior to termination, became one of the poorest. In 1954, the tribe's timber {{operations}} allowed it to be self-sufficient. The tribe, which owned utility companies, paid for a hospital, BIA salaries, local schools, and a stipend to tribal members. The tribe was forced to use its reserve funds to develop a termination plan that they did not want and instead of having a reserve, they entered into termination with a $300,000 deficit. Menominee County was created out of the old reservation boundaries and the tribe immediately had to finance its own police and fire protection. Without federal support and with no tax base, the situation became dire. The tribe closed the hospital, sold its utility company, and contracted <b>those</b> <b>services</b> to neighboring counties. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., formed to care for the tribe's needs after termination, was unable to pay property taxes and began to consider selling off tribal property. Many Menominee tribal members believed that the sponsor of the termination bill, Senator Arthur Wilkins of Utah, intended to force the loss of rich tribal lands to non-Indians. In 1962, the state of Wisconsin took the position that the hunting and fishing rights were abrogated by the termination act and that the tribal members were subject to state hunting and fishing regulations. With the poverty in the former reservation, the loss of hunting rights meant the loss of one of their last remaining means of survival.|$|E
25|$|The Metro Toronto {{federation}} {{was charged}} with the responsibility of providing the thirteen municipalities with <b>those</b> <b>services</b> which were metropolitan in nature, while <b>those</b> <b>services</b> which were local in nature were {{to be left to}} the thirteen local municipalities. Metro was responsible for administration of justice, arterial roads, metropolitan parks, metropolitan planning, public education, public transportation, sewage treatment and water facilities and some housing activities and some social services. Metro Toronto, which now had the credit of all of the municipalities could finance capital projects with bonds.|$|E
50|$|For <b>those</b> <b>service</b> {{members who}} {{completed}} initial entry training prior to 1981, the Army Service Ribbon is retroactively awarded, provided the service member {{was still on}} active duty after 1981. For <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members who enlist in the Army after serving with another service (and {{who may not be}} required to complete initial entry training) the Army Service Ribbon is awarded after four months of active service.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. Navy authorizes gold <b>service</b> stripes for <b>those</b> <b>service</b> {{members with}} over twelve {{cumulative}} years service. The service must {{be free of}} disciplinary action in the United States Navy, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps, or the United States Marine Corps Reserve in a pay status. Both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps authorizes <b>service</b> stripes to <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members for every four years of service.|$|R

25|$|Powell {{ended his}} {{speech on the}} topic of {{government}} policies aimed at providing services to military veterans, including health care and other benefits. On this, Powell said that offering <b>those</b> <b>services</b> to military veterans is as much a symbol of thanks as a memorial built in their honor.|$|E
25|$|On 14 July 2003, the President of Ireland {{signed the}} Official Languages Act 2003 into {{law and the}} {{provisions}} of the Act were gradually brought into force over a three-year period. The Act sets out the duties of public bodies regarding the provision of services in Irish and the rights of the public to avail of <b>those</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
50|$|The medal {{recognized}} <b>those</b> <b>service</b> {{members who}} had performed military occupation duty in Puerto Rico after {{the close of the}} Spanish-American War. For <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members who performed duty both during and subsequent to the Spanish-American War, the Spanish Campaign Medal was also authorized. The qualifying dates for the Army of Puerto Rican Occupation Medal were from 14 August through 10 December 1898. The United States Navy and Marine Corps had no equivalent to the Army of Puerto Rican Occupation Medal.|$|R

25|$|Boyertown Area School District {{received}} a $3,157,664 supplement {{for special education}} services in 2010. For the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received {{the same level of}} funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding was provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who needed special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required or the actual costs of <b>those</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 2007, it was {{recognized}} that outreach to most patients who would need personal assistance from health advocates {{would have to}} come from the private sector. Individuals, some with backgrounds such as nursing or case management, and others who had experience helping loved ones or friend navigate the healthcare system, began establishing private practices to provide <b>those</b> <b>services</b> to client-patients. A new organization, The Alliance of Professional Health Advocates, was founded to support those new private advocates, plus those considering such a career, with legal, insurance, marketing and other business advice.|$|E
25|$|According to Christopher B. Doob, {{outsourcing}} is companies' subcontracting {{of services}} to other companies instead of continuing to provide <b>those</b> <b>services</b> themselves. This takes away from jobs offered in the United States and {{makes it more difficult}} to maintain and get jobs. Outsourcing raises the unemployment rate, and while outsourcing has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, data on the subject is limited by the power elite. Companies like Apple and Nike outsource jobs overseas so they can have cheaper labor to make their products and keep from raising prices in the States.|$|E
5000|$|For <b>those</b> <b>service</b> {{members who}} did not {{participate}} in a designated battle campaign, the following [...] "blanket campaigns" [...] are authorized to the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, denoted by service stars.|$|R
50|$|Digital cable {{subscribers}} in many areas, such as <b>those</b> <b>serviced</b> by Comcast and Charter Communications, {{can find}} {{video on demand}} content at Channel 1. The TV Guide Network is also often found on a cable system's Channel 1.|$|R
5000|$|... 3/16 inch service {{stars were}} {{authorized}} to service members {{who participated in}} combat with Axis forces within the American Theater. This primarily applied to <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members whose units participated in anti-U-Boat patrols (Anti-submarine warfare) in the Atlantic.|$|R
25|$|Another {{government}} plan involved villagization, {{which was}} a response {{not only to the}} famine but also to the poor security situation. Beginning in 1985, peasants were forced to move their homesteads into planned villages, which were clustered around water, schools, medical services, and utility supply points to facilitate distribution of <b>those</b> <b>services.</b> Many peasants fled rather than acquiesce in relocation, which in general proved highly unpopular. Additionally, the government in most cases failed to provide the promised services. Far from benefiting agricultural productivity, the program caused a decline in food production. Although temporarily suspended in 1986, villagization was subsequently resumed.|$|E
25|$|The church holds Mass on Sunday {{mornings and}} weekday afternoons Tuesdays through Fridays. <b>Those</b> <b>services</b> may, however, be {{canceled}} if the priest is traveling {{to minister to}} other Catholics in the delta region. Catholics seeking absolution can do so a half hour before Mass, by appointment, or even if the priest {{is available at the}} rectory. At Christmas the church holds a concert where carols are sung in the local First Nations language of Gwich'in and the Inuvialuktun dialect of Inuktitut, the Inuit language, as well as English. In recent years a choir made up of Filipino immigrants to the area has joined in, singing in Tagalog.|$|E
25|$|The licence {{would be}} for 10 years and not {{automatically}} renewed. <b>Those</b> <b>services</b> are encrypted by the service provider to the subscriber. Contributors to the consultation 08/44 were given {{time to reflect on}} the terms suggested for the comparative beauty contest before 11 September 2009 and following that feedback and ComReg's further reflection on that, the comparative contest guidelines were issued and an application date set {{by the end of the}} year. The winner of that contest would have 2 years to build the network and agree terms with Other Mobile TV Service Providers. The Broadcasting Act 2009 was also referred to in Comreg Publication 09/64.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Germany clasp, for <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members who performed 92 consecutive days of military duty during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and 1949, the Berlin Airlift Device is authorized as a device to the Army of Occupation Medal.|$|R
5000|$|An {{effective}} {{attack against}} DNS might involve targeting top-level domain servers (such as <b>those</b> <b>servicing</b> the [...]com domain) instead of root name servers. Alternatively, a man-in-the-middle attack or DNS poisoning attack could be used, though {{they would be}} more difficult to carry out.|$|R
50|$|The Bombardier Badge was a {{military}} badge of the United States military which was issued between the years of 1918 and 1949. The decoration was intended to recognize the military training and qualification required by <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members who were bombardiers on board military aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} and certainly most popular night of Selichot in the Ashkenazi tradition is the first night, when many women and girls as well as men and boys attend the late-night service on Saturday night. In some communities, the hazzan wears a kittel and sings elaborate melodies. In some congregations, {{it is not unusual for}} a choir to participate in this first night's service. In the Eastern Ashkenazic tradition, this night also has more Selichot than any other night prior to Rosh Hashanah eve. The other nights are more sparsely attended and <b>those</b> <b>services</b> are often led by a layperson, rather than a trained musician, and with melodies that are less elaborate than the first night.|$|E
25|$|Telemundo {{maintains}} several {{video on}} demand services for delayed viewing of the network's programming, including its TV Everywhere service Telemundo Now; a traditional VOD service called Telemundo on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers (and like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks, disallows fast forwarding of accessed content); and via Hulu and iTunes through content deals with <b>those</b> <b>services.</b> Through its ownership by Comcast, the network's programming is also available through Xfinity on Demand. Catalogged episodes of past telenovelas seen on the network are also available on DramaFever, a streaming service that had originally exclusively focused on television shows and movies imported from various Asian countries, through a distribution deal signed on December 13, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The Silver Ferns {{were the}} only railcars to survive into the {{privatisation}} era of Tranz Rail and Toll Rail, and later re-nationalisation as KiwiRail. They were introduced to provide a premier service on the North Island Main Trunk between Wellington and Auckland, and after they were replaced by the Overlander locomotive hauled carriage train in 1991, they were redeployed to operate the Geyserland Express between Auckland and Rotorua, Kaimai Express between Auckland and Tauranga, and Waikato Connection between Hamilton and Auckland. When <b>those</b> <b>services</b> were cancelled in 2001, the Silver Ferns were transferred to Auckland and operated suburban services for the Auckland Regional Transport Authority between Britomart and Pukekohe station. The Silver Ferns are now only used for special charter services as {{they are no longer}} needed for Auckland suburban services.|$|E
50|$|The Army of Cuban Occupation Medal was a {{military}} award created by the United States War Department in June 1915.

50|$|The Air Force Fire Protection Badge is a {{military}} badge of the United States Air Force that is issued to <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members who have been trained in safety and fire prevention, have qualified as military firefighters, and have been assigned to an Air Force fire department.|$|R
50|$|A Drill Instructor Ribbon is a {{military}} award of the United States Armed Forces which is issued by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps. The Drill Instructor Ribbon recognizes <b>those</b> <b>service</b> members who are trained and qualified as military instructors to new recruits during initial basic training.|$|R
25|$|In New York, {{a village}} is an {{incorporated}} area. About 85% of villages fall {{within a single}} town. Villages in New York State are classified by the Census Bureau as incorporated places. Like all municipal corporations, villages have clearly defined legal boundaries. A village is a municipality that provides services to the residents, services {{that may or may}} not include garbage collection, management of cemeteries, street and highway maintenance, street lighting, and building codes. Some villages provide their own police and other municipal services. Villages have less autonomy than cities. <b>Those</b> <b>services</b> not provided by the village are provided by the town or towns containing the village. As of the 2000 census, 9.9% of the state's population was living in one of the 556 villages in New York.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{township}} in Michigan: general law township and charter. Charter township status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. As of April 2001, there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, police department, and so on—just like a city—but it is not required to have those things, whereas cities must provide <b>those</b> <b>services.</b> Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers.|$|E
25|$|Johnson's defense cuts, {{which began}} on April 23, 1949, were {{accelerated}} after he announced {{the cancellation of}} the 65,000-ton flushdeck aircraft carrier USS United States. The United States Navy had been planning this ship {{for several years and}} construction had already begun. Johnson, supported by a slim majority of the JCS and by President Truman, stressed the need to cut costs. At least by implication, Johnson had scuttled the Navy's hope to participate in strategic nuclear air operations through use of the carrier. Neither the Department of the Navy nor Congress had been consulted in the termination of United States. Abruptly resigning, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan expressed concern {{about the future of the}} United States Marine Corps and both Marine and Naval Aviation, and Johnson's determination to eliminate <b>those</b> <b>services</b> through progressive program cuts.|$|E
