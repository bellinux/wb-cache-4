5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} of loyalty to the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon of}} 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1990, England played West Germany in a World Cup semi-final {{match at}} Juventus's Stadio delle Alpi in Turin. Gascoigne, having already {{received}} a yellow card during England's 1–0 victory over Belgium {{in the second}} round, was booked for a foul on Thomas Berthold, which meant {{that he would be}} suspended for the final if England won the match. Television cameras showed that he had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> following the yellow card and made Gascoigne a highly popular figure with the sympathetic British public. The match culminated in a penalty shoot-out, which the Germans won after Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed their penalties.|$|E
5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> asked him why he alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} Test at The Oval, Bradman {{walked out to}} bat in Australia's first innings. He {{received}} a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, {{it would have been}} 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> a claim Bradman denied {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E

60|$|Pierston bade her good-bye, {{kissing her}} hand; turned {{from her and}} the {{incipient}} being whom he was to meet again under very altered conditions, and left the bed-chamber with a <b>tear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} that cannot be done either,' said he sadly. 'We have a baby in the house now.' He closed the reply by stooping down and kissing her, there being a <b>tear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R

25|$|On {{the day of}} {{his death}} he asked for the score to be brought to his bedside. 'Did I not say before, that I was writing this Requiem for myself?' After saying this, he looked yet again with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> through the whole work.|$|E
25|$|Huang Gai {{was hit by}} a stray arrow {{during the}} battle and fell into the river. He was saved by Sun Quan's men but they were not aware of his identity, so they left him lying on a stretcher. When Han Dang passed by, Huang Gai managed to call out to him. Han Dang {{recognised}} Huang Gai's voice so he rushed towards him. With <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> Han Dang helped Huang Gai remove his clothing so that the wound can be treated, and Huang survived.|$|E
25|$|In January 2006, Paxman was {{the subject}} of an episode of the BBC {{genealogy}} series Who Do You Think You Are?. The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman in order to impress the electorate (pax being Latin for 'peace'). Paxman's maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay's poor relief had been revoked because she had a child out of wedlock.|$|E

60|$|Yet it must {{in truth}} be confessed {{that there was}} just the {{suspicion}} of a <b>tear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and a lump <b>in</b> <b>his</b> throat as he settled back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat, but he hastily brushed away the one and swallowed the other, and put on as bold a front as he could.|$|R
25|$|Loeb is {{best remembered}} nationally for his alleged role in attacking Edmund Muskie through The Union Leader {{in what is}} known locally as the Canuck letter, derailing the Maine senator's 1972 presidential bid. Loeb {{is said to have}} helped in the forgery and {{publication}} of the letter in the paper's op-ed section. The letter slandered French-Canadians, and implied Muskie was prejudiced against them. Muskie's emotional defense of himself in front of the Union Leader offices in Manchester was seen as a sign of weakness and instability. Muskie later claimed that there were not <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> as many papers reported, but rather snowflakes (as it had been snowing that evening).|$|E
25|$|Samāvartanam (Sanskrit: समावर्तनम्). Most of {{the fourth}} canto deals with {{description}} of nature, especially the rainy season and the Āśrama of Jamadagni in the forest. Śiva permits Paraśurāma to leave in order to returns to his parents' home. When Paraśurāma is leaving, Śiva requests the Rāma Avatāra to forgive him if he disrespected him in any way while instructing him as a guru. On hearing this, Paraśurāma has <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> After bowing to Śiva and Pārvatī, and meeting their sons Gaṇeśa and Kārttikeya, Paraśurāma sets out to return. The rainy season arrives as Paraśurāma is returning home, and it is described in 44 verses (4.7–4.50). Paraśurāma enters the Āśrama of Jamadagni, which is described in 21 verses (4.61–4.81). Jamadagni and Reṇukā are elated to see their son back. Paraśurāma starts living in the Āśrama and with his actions and character, pleases all the monks and hermits in the Āśrama.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{disastrous}} defeat of Pope's army at the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Army of the Potomac, with McClellan still in command, was quickly reorganized outside of Washington {{during the first}} week of September 1862. The 22nd returned to their old camp at Halls Hill, Virginia, which they had occupied the previous winter. Sen. Wilson visited the 22nd at Halls Hill. [...] Finding just 200 war-torn men in contrast to the 1,100 he had recruited, Wilson, with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> asked, [...] "Is this my old regiment?" ...|$|E
500|$|At Franz Joseph's request, Zita and her {{children}} left their residence at Hetzendorf and moved into a suite of rooms at Schönbrunn Palace. Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia {{at the age of}} 86 on 21 November 1916. [...] "I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband," [...] Zita later recounted, [...] "and, with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> making {{the sign of the cross}} on Charles's forehead.

500|$|By June 1887, the Emperor's health had {{considerably}} worsened and {{his personal}} doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment. While in Milan he passed two weeks between life and death, even being anointed. While on a bed recovering, on 22 May 1888 he received news that slavery had been abolished in Brazil. With a weak voice and <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> he said, [...] "Great people! Great people!" [...] PedroII returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888.

500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|Galerius {{arrived in}} the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to {{reconstitute}} the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims {{that he had done}} the same to Maximian at Sirmium. On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, [...] out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.|$|E
5000|$|But to see {{the genius}} of the creator one must look upon the face.
