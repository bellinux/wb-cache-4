The [...] ("Lethal Dose 50%") test is {{used to evaluate the}} toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal population. This test was removed from OECD international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the fixed dose procedure, which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.

2500|$|The Draize Test is {{an acute}} <b>toxicity</b> <b>test</b> devised in 1944 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologists John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines. Initially used for testing cosmetics, the {{procedure}} involves applying 0.5mL or 0.5g {{of a test}} substance to the eye or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects. The animals are observed for up to 14 days for signs of erythema and edema in the skin test, and redness, swelling, discharge, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or blindness in the tested eye. The test subject is commonly an albino rabbit, though other species are used too, including dogs. The animals are euthanized after testing if the test renders irreversible damage to the eye or skin. [...] Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a [...] "wash out" [...] period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.|$|E

5000|$|Before a {{pesticide}} can be distributed, sold, {{and used}} in the United States it must first go through a registration process through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When a pesticide enters the registration process, the EPA considers the “ingredients of the pesticide; the particular site or crop on which {{it is to be}} used; the amount, frequency, and timing of its use; and storage and disposal practices.” [...] The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be {{associated with the use of}} the pesticide.

These tests include: acute <b>toxicity</b> <b>test</b> (short-term <b>toxicity</b> <b>test)</b> and chronic <b>toxicity</b> <b>test</b> (long-term <b>toxicity</b> <b>test).</b> These tests evaluate: whether the pesticide has the potential to cause adverse effects (including cancer and reproductive system disorders) on humans, wildlife, fish, and plants, including endangered species and non-target organisms; and possible contamination of surface water or ground water from leaching, runoff, and spray drift.

These models and systems are useful for screening chemicals to prioritize more toxic substances for further <b>toxicity</b> <b>testing.</b> This is particularly useful for industrial chemicals with unknown toxicity.
