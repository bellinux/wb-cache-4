Teammate Ian Craig estimated <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers.

5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.|$|E

Also that usage of the Underground has increased by 1% above pre-charge levels, having fallen substantially in 2003/2004.

25|$|In 1981, the MTA {{proposed}} {{abandoning the}} severely deteriorated line under the failed Program for Action. At the time, only 10,000 passengers used the line per day. It was proposed <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> service along nearby Franklin Avenue could {{substitute for the}} line. During the winter, the line would often be closed because there was fear that trains would derail. Stations were in horrible condition; portions of the wooden platforms were sealed off because they had burned or collapsed. In January 1982, the line needed to close for emergency repair work because a retaining wall along the line {{was in danger of}} collapse.|$|E

25|$|Some loyalists {{claim the}} Kingsmill {{massacre}} {{is the reason}} they joined paramilitary groups. One was Billy Wright, who said:I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised {{that they had been}} killed simply because they were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. He became commander of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade in the early 1990s; Wright later founded the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. He was suspected of at least 20 sectarian killings of Catholics in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
500|$|There was a 2009 plan <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> routes {{serving the}} O-Bahn would be {{enhanced}} from Hackney Road along Grenfell and Currie Streets and extended to West Terrace {{on the far}} side of the CBD along dedicated bus lanes. However, the Federal Government announced in January 2011, as part of its response to the 2010–11 Queensland floods, that the extension would be cancelled [...] "as a result of a significant scope reduction of the original project, resulting in only limited transport benefits".|$|E
500|$|Craig began poorly; in ten innings {{before the}} Tests started, he scored only 146 runs at 14.60 without passing fifty. He was {{overlooked}} for the First Test, {{and continued to}} struggle for runs during the tour; he ended with 429runs in 27innings with a top score of 71 not out and an average of 16.50. He was not selected for any Tests. Craig had difficulty adjusting to the English pitch conditions and his confidence plummeted. Craig had particular trouble against off cutters on the seaming pitches. In a reception at Lord's, the home of cricket, Queen Elizabeth II asked him [...] "I understand {{this is your first}} visit to England?", which prompted Craig to reply [...] "Yes, your majesty, and unless my batting improves, it will be my last." [...] During the tour, tensions sometimes arose between the senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Craig tended to abstain from alcohol.

500|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit {{reversed}} {{the decision of}} the District Court, holding that the cocaine should have been suppressed and that Drayton and Brown's convictions should be reversed. The Eleventh Circuit stated that its holding was compelled by circuit precedent, which held <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> passengers do not feel free to decline police officers' requests to search without [...] "some positive indication that consent could have been refused". Applying circuit precedent to the facts of the case, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that Drayton and Brown were not aware that they could have refused the search, and the evidence discovered through the pat down must be excluded at trial. The Eleventh Circuit emphasized that officers gave no reassurances that passengers were free to leave, and the fact that an officer stood next to the exit [...] "might make a reasonable person feel less free to leave the bus". On January 4, 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to review {{the decision of the}} Eleventh Circuit.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love, Sukumar {{began working}} on , a psychological thriller keeping Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist as he felt that Mahesh had a universal appeal in terms of looks. The incident of a bus driver talking about a young boy who claims that his parents were murdered in <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> was taken as the story's base. He worked on the film's script for two months, and considered it as his dream project. 1: Nenokkadine was released on 10 January 2014 globally and received generally negative reviews from the critics. While Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle opined that Sukumar [...] "fails to deliver" [...] and the story is [...] "run of the mill", Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu stated, [...] "Habitual to watching films that begin with a great premise only {{to fall into the}} commercial trap of force-fit comic situations, it comes as a relief when Sukumar laces the psychological thriller with subtle wit that never takes the focus away from the plot". 1: Nenokkadine collected approximately 289 million worldwide on a budget of 700 million, thus becoming a commercial failure.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{company of}} musicians {{traveled}} {{together in one}} bus, although the buses used for the tour were wholly inadequate, breaking down and being replaced with astounding frequency. [...] Griggs estimates that five separate buses {{were used in the}} first 11 days of the tour -- [...] "reconditioned school buses, not good enough for school kids." [...] The artists themselves were responsible for loading and unloading equipment at each stop, as no road crew assisted them. Adding to the disarray, the buses were not equipped for the weather which consisted of waist-deep snow in several areas and varying temperatures from the 20s to as low as -36°F. [...] One bus had a heating system that broke down shortly after the tour began, in Appleton, Wisconsin. [...] Later, Richardson and Valens began experiencing flu-like symptoms and drummer Bunch was hospitalized for severely frostbitten feet, after the tour bus simply broke {{down in the middle of}} the highway in subzero temperatures near Ironwood, Michigan. The musicians replaced <b>that</b> <b>bus</b> with another school bus and kept traveling. After Bunch was hospitalized, Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts took over the drumming duties. When Dion and The Belmonts were performing, the drum seat was taken by either Valens or Holly. As Holly's group had been the backing band for all of the acts, Holly, Valens, and DiMucci took turns playing drums for each other at the performances in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Clear Lake, Iowa.|$|E

2500|$|Despite death threats, Jackson {{agreed to}} sing in Montgomery. Her concert was on December 6, 1956. By then, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in Browder v.

At this concert she sang [...] "I've Heard of a City Called Heaven", [...] "Move On Up a Little Higher" [...] and [...] "Silent Night". There was a good turnout at the concert and they were happy {{with the amount of}} money raised. However, when she returned to the Abernathy's home, it had been bombed.
