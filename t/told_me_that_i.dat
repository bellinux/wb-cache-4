25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E
500|$|Galvis {{was born}} November 14, 1989, in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Venezuela, and at age 14, the Philadelphia Phillies began to scout {{him during his}} days playing youth baseball. He participated on Latin America's team in the Little League World Series, but due to his slight stature ( [...] ), {{struggled}} to captivate scouts' attention. Galvis said, [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't play (pro) baseball. But I knew I had the ability." [...] In 2006, scouts Sal Agostinelli and Jesus Mendez signed him during the amateur player signing period. Galvis, 16 years old, was not a particularly heralded prospect, but did receive some attention from scouting experts before signing with the Phillies.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} at {{a grocery store}} in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join {{the crew of the}} sailing ship Sirius as a cabin boy. He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, [...] "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever from which I suffered in Italy on account of the bad water at Genoa." [...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight. As Lody put it, [...] "Consequently, my career as a seaman was closed as soon as I discovered that, and my doctor <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not go any further." ...|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

2500|$|French {{has claimed}} that her {{self-confidence}} and self-belief stem from her father, {{who told her}} how beautiful she was each day. She stated, [...] "He taught me to value myself.

2500|$|His first movie, 12 Angry Men, was an auspicious {{beginning}} for Lumet. It {{was a critical}} success and established Lumet as a director skilled at adapting theatrical properties to motion pictures. For US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, seeing the film {{for the first time}} was a pivotal moment in her life, as she was at that time considering a career in law. [...] "It <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was on the right path," [...] she said. Fully half of Lumet's complement of films have originated in the theater.|$|E

2500|$|No cricket {{had come}} from Swabi before and Junaid Khan didn't take {{interest}} in cricket initially, he played with tape-ball & was introduced to hard ball set up by his cousin. At 16 years age Junaid Khan was measured as the fastest bowler in the NWFP Twenty/20 competition. Junaid Khan said, [...] "Some of my team mates suggested that I should go for the Under 17 trials Abbottabad. I was in two minds but afterwards I was relieved that I attended the trials, as Ehteshamuddin spotted me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had potential and that I should go to Lahore".|$|E
2500|$|In sheer power, {{her high}} notes were {{sometimes}} {{compared to those}} of the Broadway belter Ethel Merman. However Nilsson claims her [...] "explosive" [...] high notes that were her biggest asset on-stage [...] "have not been recorded like they should have been" [...] in the studio. She later lamented: [...] "It always made me a little bit sad when I heard my own recordings. And many people <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sang much better in person than I do on the recordings! That didn't flatter me at all, because I know what's going to be left when I am no longer singing". Once urged to follow Nilsson in the same role at the Metropolitan Opera, the eminent soprano Leonie Rysanek refused.|$|E

Waqar says [...] "I remember Imran was not feeling well at the time, and was not present at the camp. Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, {{and there was a}} match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection was just out of this world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning. And do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 12 April 2006, Afridi {{announced}} a temporary retirement from Test cricket {{so that he}} could concentrate on ODIs, with a particular focus on the 2007 World Cup, and {{to spend more time with}} his family. He said he would consider reversing his decision after the World Cup. Afridi had played ten Tests since being recalled to the side in January 2005, averaging 47.44 with the bat including four centuries. However, on 27 April he reversed his decision, saying that [...] " [...] <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am one of the main players in the team and squad and that Pakistan really needed me". Before Pakistan toured England in July to September, Afridi played for Ireland as an overseas player in the C Trophy. In six matches, he scored 128runs and took seven wickets. England won the four-match Test series 3–0; Afridi played two matches, scoring 49runs and took three wickets. It was the last Test cricket Afridi played until 2010.|$|E
2500|$|A {{contest for}} fans {{to create an}} album cover image for 20 Y.O. was {{announced}} on July 18, 2006, through Yahoo!. Fans were able to create and submit their own album-cover design, with four winners being chosen by Jackson herself. The first million copies of the album would be published with these fan-created covers. The concept of the contest was to create an image that best celebrated Jackson's past twenty years. The singer hand-picked dozens of images that span over twenty years of Jackson's career were made available for download for use in creating the design. [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should pick maybe 20, 30 photos, but I think I went a little crazy. I picked way more than that. I gave them {{some of the new}} stuff I just shot for the album cover shoot. So they have some really recent photos as well as some stuff from 20 years ago", Jackson confessed. For the official artwork for the album, Jackson appears sporting big hair and a wrist full of bracelets.|$|E

[...] "The administrator [...] interrupted me," [...] Dr. Hansen said in the New York Times, [...] "he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not talk about dangerous anthropogenic interference, {{because we do not}} know enough or have enough evidence for what would constitute dangerous anthropogenic interference."

Dr. Einaudi confirmed that Mr. O'Keefe had interrupted the presentation to say that these were [...] "delicate issues" [...] {{and there was a lot}} of uncertainty about them.
