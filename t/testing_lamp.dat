40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{analytical}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} of a newly described DNA amplification technique, LAMP and nested PCR assay targeting the RE and B 1 genes {{for the detection of}} Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) DNA. MethodsThe {{analytical sensitivity}} of LAMP and nested-PCR was obtained against 10 -fold serial dilutions of T. gondii DNA ranging from 1 ng to 0. 01 fg. DNA samples of other parasites and human chromosomal DNA were used to determine the specificity of molecular assays. ResultsAfter <b>testing</b> <b>LAMP</b> and nested-PCR in duplicate, the detection limit of RE-LAMP, B 1 -LAMP, RE-nested PCR and B 1 -nested PCR assays was one fg, 100 fg, 1 pg and 10 pg of T. gondii DNA respectively. All the LAMP assays and nested PCRs were 100 % specific. The RE-LAMP assay revealed the most sensitivity for the detection of T. gondii DNA. ConclusionsThe obtained results demonstrate that the LAMP technique has a greater sensitivity for detection of T. gondii. Furthermore, these findings indicate that primers based on the RE are more suitable than those based on the B 1 gene. However, the B 1 -LAMP assay has potential as a diagnostic tool for detection of T. gondii...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to realize a luminous flux scale (lumens) using an integrating sphere with a known amount of flux introduced from an external source. The integrating sphere features {{an opening for}} a detector, a <b>test</b> <b>lamp</b> in its center, a baffle between the <b>test</b> <b>lamp</b> and the detector. A second opening is used to introduce flux from an external source, and is appropriately baffled from the <b>test</b> <b>lamp.</b> Flux from the external source is introduced into the sphere through a limiting aperture of known area. The flux entering the sphere is determined from knowledge of the illuminance on the aperture plane and {{the area of the}} aperture. The total flux from the <b>test</b> <b>lamp</b> is deduced by comparison to the flux from the external source. Theoretical analysis is first made by computer simulation based on a ray tracing technique. Several integrating sphere designs are analyzed under various conditions, and {{based on the results of}} the simulation, an integrating sphere 50 cm in diameter is built to conduct experiments. The characteristics of the sphere are measured and compared with the simulation results. The total luminous flux values of several miniature lamps measured with this method are found to agree within 0. 5 % with measurements using goniophotometric technique. This method can be applied also to realize a total spectral radiant flux scale...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{guidelines}} {{established by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provide recommendations for the construction and use of <b>test</b> <b>lamps.</b> Probes must be well-insulated, with minimal exposure of live terminals, with finger guards to prevent accidental contact, and must not expose live wires if the <b>test</b> <b>lamp</b> glass bulb is broken. To limit the energy delivered {{in case of a}} short-circuit, test lights must have a current-limiting fuse or current-limiting resistor and fuse. The HSE guidelines also recommend procedures to validate operation of the test light. When a known live circuit is not available, a separate proving unit that provides a known test voltage and sufficient power to illuminate the lamp is used to confirm operation of the lamp before and after testing a circuit.|$|R

40|$|Background: Entamoeba histolytica, the causative {{agent for}} {{amoebiasis}} {{is a considerable}} burden to population in the developing countries where it accounts for over 50 million infections. The tools for detection of amoebiasis are inadequate and diagnosis relies on microscopy which means a significant percent of cases remain undiagnosed. Moreover, tests formats that can be rapidly applied in rural endemic areas are not available. Methods: In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal <b>test</b> (<b>LAMP)</b> based on 18 S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was designed with extra reaction accelerating primers (stem primers) and compared with the published <b>LAMP</b> and PCR <b>tests</b> in detection of E. histolytica DNA in clinical samples.

The LAMP assay rapidly ampliﬁed the target gene within 50 min incubation at 63 °C in a laboratory water bath. The LAMP amplicon could be visualised directly in the reaction tubes following the addition of SYBR Green I dye. The detection limit of this LAMP method was 10 CFU/mL, which was 10 times more sensitive than the earlier 16 S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test conducted by Oliveira, Galina and Pijoan (2001), and no cross-reactivity was observed from other non- H. parasuis strains.

40|$|Metal halide high {{intensity}} discharge (HID) lamps typically operate as multi-atmosphere thermal arcs in the steady state, {{but during the}} starting phase the lamps are moderate pressure glow discharges.

The goal of this thesis was to investigate basic processes using rare gas mixtures so that optimum starting strategies can be developed for metal halide HID lamps. Breakdown measurements on a <b>test</b> <b>lamp</b> were conducted at various pulse repetition frequencies (0. 005 - 1000 Hz), voltage pulses (up to 2000 V), pressures (0. 5 – 110 Torr), and argon/xenon compositions, and with various ground planes. Photographs of discharges in argon, xenon, and a 10 % xenon in argon mixture were also taken at various pressures to provide additional insight. It was found that the mean breakdown time reflects the rate at which electrons are being created, and is dependent upon E/N (electric field) /(gas number density) and capacitive effects.

50|$|Screwdriver-type <b>test</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are very}} inexpensive, but cannot meet the {{construction}} requirements of UK GS 38. If the shaft is exposed, a shock hazard {{to the user}} exists, and the internal construction of the tester provides no protection against short-circuit faults. Failure of the resistor and lamp series network can put the user in direct metallic contact with the circuit under test. For example, water trapped inside the screwdriver may allow enough leakage current to shock the user. Even if an internal short circuit does not electrocute the user, the resulting electric shock {{may result in a}} fall or other injury. The lamp provides no indication below the strike voltage of the neon lamp, and so cannot detect certain hazardous leakage conditions. Since it relies on capacitance to complete the circuit, direct-current potential cannot be reliably indicated. If the user of the screwdriver is themselves isolated from ground and capacitively coupled to other nearby live wires, a false negative may occur when they test a live circuit, and a false positive when they test a dead circuit. False negatives may also occur in brightly lit areas which make the neon glow hard to see.|$|R

Both fluorescent and mercury lamps have also a strong voltage dependence in reactive power. The bimetallic regulated radiators act as a constant impedance load during a time period of tens of seconds, but have a pronounced dynamic behaviour in a time range of minutes. Unexpectedly, the mean power was changed in an opposite direction to the voltage, i. e. when the voltage step was negative the mean power increased and vice versa, and the original mean power as it was prior to the disturbance was not regained. This effect is explained by two resistors in the bimetallic switch. The electronically regulated radiators also act as a constant impedance load during a time period of tens of seconds. The dynamic behaviour after a voltage step, in a time range of minutes, is a damped oscillation in mean power, where the prior mea...|$|R

40|$|The Absolute Integrating-Sphere Method was {{developed}} and introduced by NIST for {{the realization of the}} luminous flux unit using an integrating sphere rather than a goniophotometer. The total luminous flux of a lamp inside the sphere is calibrated against the known amount of flux introduced into the sphere from the external source through a calibrated aperture. The key element of this method is the correction for the spatial nonuniformity of the integrating sphere, which has been made possible by a technique using a scanning-beam source. This method is to be applied directly to routine calibration measurements of luminous flux. A new luminous flux calibration facility with a 2. 5 m integrating sphere has been recently completed at NIST and will allow the calibration of <b>test</b> <b>lamps</b> with no need for luminous flux standard lamps.
