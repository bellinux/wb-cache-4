25|$|Lieb {{reported}} his car had a vibration while Hartley {{was warned}} about track limits. The No. 95 Aston Martin continued to the lead the LMGTE Pro field but the team's No. 98 car required a door change because it {{lost one of}} its wing mirrors, dropping it to sixth. Joël Camathias in KCMG's Porsche was now running {{at the front of}} LMGTE Am ahead of the second-placed No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. Jarvis closed to 0.8 seconds behind Hartley until the latter responded by going half a second quicker but later reported his car was loose under braking when entering the track's corners. Hartley lost time through traffic and Jarvis overtook him for the lead at <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> chicane. Hartley was caught by Lotterer who passed him for second at the first turn. Porsche identified a loss in tyre pressure in Hartley's car and chose to pit him, and Webber climbed aboard the No. 1 car. Lieb made a pit stop from the lead, handing first and second positions to both Toyota cars. Buemi held it for the next few laps until their stops and ceded it to Webber. Pierre Ragues became the LMGTE Am leader after moving in front of François Perrodo and the KCMG Porsche. The first full course yellow was necessitated when Perrodo spun his car into <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> chicane gravel trap. Marshals cleaned the track at the ninth and twelfth turns.|$|E
25|$|Lotterer in the No. 8 Audi was fastest on the car's first timed lap and {{remained}} quickest {{with an average}} time of one minute and 39.444 seconds to clinch the team's second pole position of the season. The car was joined on the grid's front row by the sister Audi of di Grassi, Jarvis and Duval. Jarvis had his fastest time revoked after spinning at <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> chicane late in qualifying because he had violated track limits. Porsche's No. 1 vehicle took third with Webber and Timo Bernhard behind the wheel; Webber was unable to improve on his lap time, misjudged his braking point and went across <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> chicane, while Bernard was delayed by LMP2 vehicles on both his laps. They were ahead of the team's second entry, driven by Lieb and Jani, and both Toyota cars took fifth and sixth. Lieb had no electrical boost on his first lap, while on his second attempt, he braked early for the chicane. Davidson attributed his car's position to having one timed lap and being delayed by traffic, while Sébastien Buemi stated {{it was due to}} Toyota placing their focus on the race which compromised their qualifying performance. Sarrazin was unable to push hard because of the damp track. The two Rebellion cars rounded out the LMP1 qualifiers in seventh and ninth; they were separated by the No. 4 ByKolles Racing car of Simon Trummer, Oliver Webb and Pierre Kaffer.|$|E
25|$|The race resumed {{thirteen}} {{minutes later}} with the No. 1 Porsche driven by Webber leading teammate Jani and Duval, Jani closed the gap to teammate Webber {{over the next ten}} minutes and the Australian driver was instructed by Porsche to allow Jani to move ahead of him because of the Swiss driver's faster pace. Jani overtook Webber for the lead at the first corner shortly afterwards. Jani was issued with a drive-through penalty for his collision with the No. 88 Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing car which he served four minutes later. He was able to catch Duval and attempted to pass him around the outside but the French driver defended his position at the first turn. The two drivers continued to battle, allowing Lotterer to reduce the time distance. Lotterer attempted to overtake Jani around the outside but Jani defended his position, causing Lotterer to run wide and the two drivers made minor contact. Lotterer reduced his speed but caught back up to Jani while moving through slower cars. Jani was overtaken by Lotterer at <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> chicane but the two drivers drove alongside each other in the final turn and Jani reclaimed second position at turn one. Jani's car was hit at its rear-end by a BR01 car at the chicane. Lotterer was able to move into second by passing Jani in the Mercedes Arena section.|$|E

5000|$|The NGK's {{opinion of}} the Belhar Confession had varied over the years. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> {{rejected}} the confession as being a political document or as a statement of Liberation Theology. Some time later <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> acknowledged that the document's contents were true, {{with the proviso that}} references in the Belhar Confession to [...] "the poor" [...] not be regarded as an implicit reference to non-whites.

50|$|In the 1980s and {{the early}} 1990s Heyns became a central figure in the {{struggle}} to change <b>the</b> <b>NGK’s</b> stance on Apartheid, leading to the church’s eventual rejection of that policy. In 1982 Heyns publicly rejected the notion that Apartheid was the will of God, and caused a furor at that year’s synod by openly supporting multiracial marriages. For a year he stayed out of favor with the church hierarchy, but reemerged in 1986 to become moderator - the highest position in the church. He immediately tried to persuade the church that there was no biblical foundation for Apartheid.|$|R

5000|$|In <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> {{meanwhile}} {{there was}} more controversy over theological liberalism and conservatism. An evangelical revival led by Andrew Murray tipped the balance away from theological liberalism.

50|$|He {{was born}} in 1847 near Paarl in the Cape Colony at Plaas Kleinbos, a farm {{that had been in}} the family's {{possession}} since their arrival in the Cape as Hugenot refugees in 1688. He was educated at Paarl Gimnasium and studied theology at the Theological Seminary at Stellenbosch, completing his studies in 1872 and was ordained as a minister in the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) (<b>NGK)</b> <b>the</b> same year. Theologically his view were much influenced by the Abraham Kuyper the Dutch Neo-Calvinist thinker. This made many congregations reluctant to invite him to be their minister.

2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and [...] "lumpy" [...] running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, [...] "afterfiring"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the [...] "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any [...] "M" [...] (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki {{toyed with the idea of}} two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in <b>the</b> rotor housing (<b>NGK</b> A9EFV).|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} his {{translation of the}} Bible into Afrikaans, following the principals of translation laid down by the Synod of Dordrecht requiring {{the use of the}} original Hebrew of Greek where appropriate. He succeeded in translating the Book of Genesis, the Psalms, the Songs of Solomon, Book of Joshua, the Gospel according to Matthew, the Gospel according to Mark, the Acts of the Apostles and the Book of Revelation. Du Toit's translation program was not well received - neither the synod of <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> in Orange Free State in 1885 nor the synod of <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> in the South African Republic in 1886 supported du Toit's efforts. By 1890 the Eerste Taalbeweging (first language movement) was all but dead.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990 Church and Society was revised by <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> to {{indicate}} that [...] "any attempt by a church to try to defend a system of separation, biblically and ethically {{must be seen as}} a serious errancy; that is to say, it is in conflict with the Bible." [...] For the APK it was not acceptable, because it was not practical for one church, or one congregation, to do ministry in all indigenous languages, and they respect the fact that God created all nations, {{and the best way to}} grow spiritually was to serve the Lord with one's own people in one's own language. The decision of <b>the</b> <b>NGK</b> led to an increase in the number of congregations choosing to join the APK.|$|E
50|$|In 1824 an {{autonomous}} synod was {{established at the}} Cape, removing the church from control from the Netherlands.

50|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{formation}} of the new church, was the growing influence of Arminian and liberal theology in <b>the</b> <b>NGK.</b> The new church also opposed the use of the new Afrikaans Bible translation (1983) during worship services.
