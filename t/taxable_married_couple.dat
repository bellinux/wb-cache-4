50|$|It was {{reported}} that <b>married</b> and engaged <b>couples</b> used more assurances and task sharing than did dating couples. However, engaged and seriously dating couples reported that they used openness and positivity more than did <b>married</b> <b>couples.</b> Then, <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> reported the most social networking. Daters {{tended to be more}} social with one another. For example, they called and sent each other notes and cards more than the <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> did.|$|R
50|$|The average {{household}} income of same-sex couples is $53,720, compared to $59,692 for <b>married</b> <b>couples.</b> The median income of both same-sex and <b>married</b> <b>coupled</b> households in New Mexico is $47,000.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} a <b>married</b> person or <b>couple</b> benefits from various taxation advantages {{not available to}} a single person. For example, spouses may be allowed to average their combined incomes. This is advantageous to a <b>married</b> <b>couple</b> with disparate incomes. To compensate for this, countries may provide a higher tax bracket for the averaged income of a <b>married</b> <b>couple.</b> While income averaging might still benefit a <b>married</b> <b>couple</b> with a stay-at-home spouse, such averaging would cause a <b>married</b> <b>couple</b> with roughly equal personal incomes to pay more total tax than they would as two single persons. In the United States, {{this is called the}} marriage penalty.|$|R

50|$|The {{marriage}} penalty in the United States {{refers to the}} higher taxes required from some <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> with both partners earning income {{that would not be}} required by two otherwise identical single people with exactly the same incomes. There is also a marriage bonus that applies in other cases. Multiple factors are involved, but in general, in the current U.S. system, single-income <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> usually benefit from filing as a <b>married</b> <b>couple</b> (similar to so-called income splitting), while dual-income <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> are often penalized. The percentage of couples affected has varied over the years, depending on shifts in tax rates.|$|R

40|$|Cohabiting and <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> are {{analysed}} {{in presence}} of income uncertainty and precautionary saving. <b>Married</b> <b>couples</b> have legal con-straints on their relationship that {{force them to}} act cooperatively, while cohabitants are likely to act non-cooperatively. This makes risk sharing different for different couples; cohabitants share risk {{to a lesser extent}} than do <b>married</b> <b>couples,</b> and their savings decision is further distorted by strategic undersaving. The conclusion is therefore a kind of paradox, co-habitants who have abstained from marriage due to higher preferences for independence and equality are less equal than <b>married</b> <b>couples,</b> and they also act strategically to be able to increase assistance from their partner...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> not living {{together and the}} risks of contracting HIV. More specifically, the {{study examined}} four aspects, namely, awareness of HIV/AIDS among <b>married</b> <b>couples,</b> factors influencing <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> not to live together, effects of <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> not to live together and the challenges encountered. The study used survey qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The total sample size of 114 respondents was selected through purposive and simple random sampling techniques. The respondents included 100 couples not living together, 8 group’s Representatives and 6 leader (Ministry/village) officials. The study used questionnaires, in-depth face-to-face interviews and focus group discussion as data collection methods. Study findings revealed that 23. 7 percent of respondents were unaware {{of ways in which}} HIV is transmitted, and had wrong information concerning the disease. Also 73. 7 percent of respondents reported that job responsibility was the main factor that made the <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> not to live together. Then 72. 8 percent of respondents reported that the main benefit the <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> got for not living together was an increase in family income. However, the main challenge reported involved temptations, responded by 42. 2 percent of the respondents. Finally, the study recommended that the government should keep a strong policy, which should require <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> to work together in the same location so as to avoid not living together. ...|$|R

50|$|No {{income tax}} is charged {{on the basic}} allowance, which is €8,354 for {{unmarried}} persons and €16,708 for jointly assessed <b>married</b> <b>couples.</b> Beyond this threshold, the marginal tax rate increases linearly from 14% to 24% for a taxable income of €13,469 (€26,938 for <b>married</b> <b>couples).</b> In the subsequent interval up to a taxable income of €52,881 (€105,762 for <b>married</b> <b>couples),</b> the marginal tax rate increases linearly from 24% to 42%.

This, however, {{does not apply to}} much newer movements in the Catholic Church that accept <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> even into their core governance structures, of course. Check new communities such as Verbum Dei Missionary Fraternity, etc. Missionary <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> there profess spirituality of the community there too.

40|$|Summary-Dating and <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> show {{comparable}} {{levels of}} assortment for physical traits. <b>Married</b> <b>couples.</b> however, are more assorted on psychological traits. It {{is argued that}} both dating and <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> initially assort on physical similarity, but that couples who are similar on psychological traits {{are more likely to}} marry. Physical traits are apparently critical in initial partner selection; psychological traits are more important for long-term relationships. There is little evidence that couples become more similar in psychological traits over time, implying that existing similarities are due to initial assortment.

In these cases, <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> may not form an independent household, but remain part of an extended family household.|$|R
