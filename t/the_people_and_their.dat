As he contemplates the final letter, he {{and the rest of}} the Fringe team are called to investigate several dead bodies in a passenger car of a train. Walter, after being told the victims' personal electronics were drained of power, suspects someone drew energy from both <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> devices' batteries. They trace the man responsible to MIT astrophysics professor Alistair Peck (Peter Weller), and enter his residence to search for clues, finding evidence that Alistair was studying time travel. Alistair arrives while the Fringe team is there, and activates a mechanism on his body, causing him to travel back in time.|$|E

Even though {{the unity of}} the Western Church was to last for another hundred years, and though the Papacy was to {{experience}} greater material prosperity than ever before, the Great Schism had done irreparable damage. The internal struggles within the Church had impaired her claim to universal rule, and promoted anti-clericalism among <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> rulers, paving the way for reform movements.|$|E

Columbus was received by the native cacique Guacanagari, who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, La Navidad, leaving behind 39 men.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 40 rivers {{rise in the}} BMNP area, {{contributing}} to five major rivers: the Web, Wabe Shebele, Welmel, Dumal and Ganale. Additionally, the Bale massif is the source for many springs in the lowlands, which are of paramount importance as {{they are the only}} source of water year-round. People living south of the national park are completely dependent on good management of the water resources from the highland areas. If the flow of these rivers is altered in any way – through deforestation, overgrazing of pastures and/or over abstraction for irrigation (all of which are occurring at present) – a highland/lowland imbalance results with loss of perennial water in the lowlands. If such a situation arises, the dry season range of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> livestock reduces dramatically and they concentrate about whatever water source remains. It is widely recognized that such uneven distribution of people and livestock leads to rapid and lasting degradation. The people are, therefore, likely to become increasingly food-aid dependent if the water catchment areas of the Bale Mountains are insufficiently protected. There is already evidence that over abstraction of water in the Bale Mountains is occurring.|$|E
25|$|Beltane is {{mentioned}} {{in some of}} the earliest Irish literature and it is associated with important events in Irish mythology. It marked the beginning of summer and was when cattle were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were performed to protect the cattle, crops and people, and to encourage growth. Special bonfires were kindled, and their flames, smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> cattle would walk around the bonfire or between two bonfires, and sometimes leap over the flames or embers. All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire. These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast, and some of the food and drink would be offered to the aos sí. Doors, windows, byres and the cattle themselves would be decorated with yellow May flowers, perhaps because they evoked fire. In parts of Ireland, people would make a May Bush: a thorn bush decorated with flowers, ribbons and bright shells. Holy wells were also visited, while Beltane dew was thought to bring beauty and maintain youthfulness. Many of these customs were part of May Day or Midsummer festivals in other parts of Great Britain and Europe.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} Roman Republic contributed {{significantly}} to many aspects of democracy, {{only a minority of}} Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of gerrymandering, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a Republic as a nation-state, although it didn't have much of a democracy. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved. Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Other cultures, such as the Iroquois Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.|$|E

[...] Black would often lecture his colleagues, liberal or conservative, on the Supreme Court about the importance of acting within the limits of the Constitution.|$|E

500|$|The mid-war {{years were}} momentous times. Governing {{politicians}} in Paris and London were under great {{pressure from the}} press, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> parliaments to win the war. Hundreds of thousands of casualties had been suffered at the battles of Gallipoli, the Somme and Verdun, with little prospect of victory in sight. The British Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, resigned in early December 1916 and was succeeded by David Lloyd George. In France, Prime Minister Aristide Briand, along with Minister of Defence Hubert Lyautey were politically diminished and resigned in March 1917, following disagreements over the prospective Nivelle Offensive. The United States was close to declaring war on Germany; American public opinion was growing increasingly incensed by U-boat attacks upon civilian shipping, starting with the sinking of [...] in 1915 and culminating in the torpedoing of seven American merchantmen in early 1917. The United States Congress finally declared war on Imperial Germany on 6 April 1917 {{but it would be}} {{more than a year before}} a suitable army could be raised, trained and transported to France.|$|E

500|$|MacDermot {{has claimed}} that the songs [...] "can't all be the same. [...] You've got to get {{different}} styles.... I like to think they're all a little different." [...] As such, the music in Hair runs the gamut of rock: from the rockabilly sensibilities of [...] "Don't Put it Down" [...] to the folk rock rhythms of [...] "Frank Mills" [...] and [...] "What a Piece of Work is Man". [...] "Easy to Be Hard" [...] is pure rhythm and blues, and protest rock anthems abound: [...] "Ain't Got No" [...] and [...] "The Flesh Failures". [...] The acid rock of [...] "Walking in Space" [...] and [...] "Aquarius" [...] are balanced by the mainstream pop of [...] "Good Morning Starshine". [...] Scott Miller ties the music of Hair to the hippies' political themes: [...] "The hippies... were determined to create art of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist. ...he hippies' music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government."
