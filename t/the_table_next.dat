500|$|Roger asks Peggy {{to devise}} a new Mohawk Airlines {{campaign}} over the weekend, {{in an attempt to}} cover for {{the fact that he had}} neglected to put the creative team on that task a week earlier. Peggy, realizing that for once she has the upper hand, agrees to the favor only after Roger hands over all the cash in his wallet ($410, an exorbitant amount in 1966), rejecting the ten dollars which Roger initially offered her (explaining that [...] "the work is ten dollars; the lie is extra."). While working late, Peggy discovers Dawn sleeping in Don's office. Peggy offers Dawn a spot on her couch at home, as Dawn worries about returning to her own home in Harlem due to racial tension in the area. Peggy and Dawn drink beers at Peggy's apartment, while Peggy reveals insecurity over whether she [...] "acts like a man" [...] or not. While leaving her apartment's living room, Peggy has an awkward moment with Dawn when Peggy realizes that her purse (with Roger's cash still inside) is alone on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> to Dawn. Peggy cleans up and leaves the purse next to Dawn. Peggy wakes up the next morning to find a note from Dawn apologizing for inconveniencing Peggy.|$|E
500|$|John is also {{surprised}} to discover that Sherlock is in a relationship with Mary's bridesmaid, Janine. Sherlock tells John that he is dating her because she is Magnussen's personal assistant, and he uses their relationship to assist him with breaking into Magnussen's office in London. Inside, Sherlock and John find an incapacitated Janine, and Sherlock happens upon Mary holding Magnussen at gunpoint. Mary shoots Sherlock, who harnesses all his mental powers to stay conscious. He is taken to hospital. In his mind palace, Sherlock fades away, {{at the same time in}} the real world Sherlock dies on the operating table in pre-op preparation. In the mind palace, Moriarty convinces Sherlock that he's letting John down by dying, which convinces the mind palace Sherlock to wake up and escape. [...] At this time, in the real world, Sherlock's heart begins to beat again. [...] The surgeons attempt to help revive him, by giving him oxygen. Sherlock wakes up in surgery and mouths [...] "Mary". [...] Mary comes into the hospital and is met by John, who says that Sherlock had survived surgery. Mary visits the dazed and severely injured Sherlock and warns him not to denounce her. John nonetheless begins to suspect something after he finds that Sherlock replaced John's chair in the Baker Street flat and left a bottle of Mary's perfume on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> to it.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{coming to}} Boston, on 23 April 1912, `Abdu'l-Bahá {{attended}} several events. One was a reception in Washington D.

Gregory, was seated {{at the head of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> to himself, an event that was highly noted at the time and since. One of the early versions of the story of this event was told by Harlan Ober.|$|E

2500|$|The crucifix, {{painting}} of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa, and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave: Instead of Ripa's suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book, Vermeer put them on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> to her. According to Arthur Wheelock, a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, this is [...] "an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character {{not found in the}} text." [...] By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the painting's frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop, the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting. Wheelock, citing his fellow academic at the University of Maryland, Quint Gregory, believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix [...] "may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms", a very Catholic idea. Selena Cant calls the fact that the book, chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass.|$|E
