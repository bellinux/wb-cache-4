The dispersed manufacturing of ICBM components seriously complicated researching and building new missile systems.

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a series {{evaluating}} the data reported to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was incomplete. This report examines the factors that are associated with reporting rates for the state of North Dakota. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the North Dakota crash file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Overall, it appears that North Dakota is reporting 64. 2 percent of crash involvements that should be reported to the MCMIS Crash file. There is also evidence that about 17 percent of the records reported do not meet the reporting standard. Reporting rates were found to be related to crash severity, the configuration of the vehicle, and the type of enforcement agency that covered the crash. Over 93. 3 percent of fatal crashes were reported, 81. 8 percent of injury/transported crashes, and 57. 5 percent of tow/disabled involvements. More than 72 percent of reportable involvements of <b>truck-tractors</b> were reported, but the reporting rate was 47. 4 percent for 2 -axle, 6 -tire single-unit trucks. Only 30. 8 percent of bus involvements were reported. Missing data rates are low for most variables. Overall, the crash report is well-designed to support full reporting. The information necessary to identify reportable cases is available in the crash file, so a substantial improvement in the reporting rate can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 22) Special report, Task DThis {{report is}} part of a series of reports evaluating the data reported to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was significantly incomplete. This report examines the sources of underreporting for the state of Florida. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the Florida Police Accident Report (PAR) file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Overall, only 24. 0 % of reportable crash involvements are reported to the MCMIS Crash file. In addition, 14. 8 % of cases that are reported do not qualify for reporting. Reporting rates vary by vehicle type, crash severity, and reporting agency. Almost 56 % of fatal involvements are reported, 26. 5 % of injury, transported involvements, and only 20. 0 % of towed/disabled involvements. Over 48 % of the involvements of <b>truck-tractors</b> are reported, but only 6. 0 % of medium trucks, and less than 3 percent of buses. The reporting rate was highest for the Florida Highway Patrol at 31. 9 %. Sheriff’s offices reported at a 19. 3 % rate, and only 14. 2 % of reportable crashes covered by police departments were reported. A major contributor to underreporting is likely a reliance on an entry in the commercial vehicle only line of the Florida police accident report (PAR) to identify reportable vehicles. This is an error because the reportability criteria for the MCMIS file consider only vehicle configuration and crash severity, not operations. In addition, the structure of that line in the Florida PAR may favor interstate carriers, while the crashes of both interstate and intrastate carriers must be reported...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} main {{causes of}} threats posed on articulated vehicles traffic {{safety and the}} methods for their prevention. Based on the motoric properties evaluation method, the capabilities of military articulated vehicles as of 2010 were examined in that respect. Articulated vehicles, which include <b>truck-tractor</b> and semi-trailer, are used for carriage of the so-called combat technology in the armed forces. Problems related to transportation of military equipment have inter alia been presented in papers [1, 2]. They result primarily from the significant linear dimensions and large weights, which are characteristic for the articulated vehicle of <b>truck-tractor</b> and semi-trailer. Other, additional problems affecting the safety of traffic {{are related to the}} type of cargo and its fixing mode [3]. In the case of articulated military vehicles, in most cases, wheeled or tracked vehicles are transported, that is a very specific cargo, difficult to be fixed to the flatbeds of the semi-trailers. All these vehicles should have their load floor located as low as possible because the floor placed too high may cause that the total height of the vehicle and the load carried will interfere with the road infrastructure (tunnels, overpasses, electric traction over the roadway, etc.), and the highly located centre of mass negatively affects the stability of motion [3]...|$|E

40|$|Infield to zone {{transportation}} with agricultural tractor-trailer units may incur {{costs of}} up to nine times those of long distance <b>truck-tractor</b> units. This necessitates the implementation of an optimal cane extraction road network. This paper describes formulas derived to evaluate whether the construction of additional roads and loading zones could enhance a farm’s profitability. The formulas were subsequently applied in a case study typical of a 250 ha commercial sugarcane farm in South Africa, to quantify the technique’s economic value and to demonstrate additional practical constraints. Transport savings were calculated at R 23 000 per annum, and costs incurred on capital expansion was recovered after six crop cycles (ratoons). The results suggest that significant reductions in transport costs can be achieved in the South African sugar industry, especially by {{increasing the number of}} loading zones on existing roads. The case study did, however, identify several other factors, such as topography, cash flow requirements and vehicle utilisation issues that may alter road upgrading decisions. This work has been based on similar analyses currently under way in the South African timber industry...|$|E
40|$|Accident {{rates of}} heavy truck-tractors are {{modelled}} using log-linear methods. The accident data used are a census of <b>truck-tractor</b> involvements in Michigan from May 1987 to April 1988. Travel data {{used to calculate}} the rates were produced by a survey of truck-tractors in Michigan covering the same time period. Both the accident and travel data were limited to Michigan-registered tractors operating in Michigan. Log-linear models of casualty and property-damage-only accident rates were developed using number of trailers, road type, area type, and time of day as predictor variables. Overall, differences between tractors with one and two trailers were not significant. Tractors with no trailers (bobtails) have significantly higher accident rates. Characteristics of the operating environment were found to have larger effects on the accident rate than tractor configuration (except for the bobtail). Rates varied by a factor of up to 6. 8, depending on the road type. Casualty accident risk at night was 1. 4 times the risk during the day. The risk of a casualty accident in rural areas was 1. 6 times that of urban areas...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{description}} of realised implementations of semi-active road-friendly truck suspensions and with the description of provided experiments. The possible consequences in form of economical feasibility of serial practical implementations are included. There have been materialised two implementations. The first one was within the EU funded Copernicus project SADTS - Semi-Active Damping of Truck Suspsension and Its Influence on Driver and Road Loads  in 1997 - 98. The second one was within the mutual workshop of IKA RWTH, DLR, CTU  Moderne Nutzfahrzeug-Fahrwerke, Potential zur Ladegut- und Fahrbahnschonung  in Aachen in March 2000. the first implementation was on the SKODA-LIAZ platform truck and the second one was on the MAN <b>truck-tractor</b> with semi-trailer. Both implementations have again proved that the semi-active suspension is capable to decrease the dynamic part of road-tyre forces and to reduce road damage. The semi-active road-friendly suspension can serve for the reduction of road damage or for the allowed increase of useful truck payload. The economical feasibility of both variants is shortly provided...|$|E
