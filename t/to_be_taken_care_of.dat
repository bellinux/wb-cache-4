5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party's leader, was a full day ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in the Moroccan Quarter of the Old City. They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; {{when he died in}} 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E

25|$|In {{families}} {{with more than}} one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{experience}} of economic instability throughout the 1990s, and {{the implementation of a}} free travel agreement with the EU, a great number of Romanians emigrated to Western Europe and North America, with particularly large communities in Italy and Spain. In 2008, the Romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over twomillion people. The cyclical nature of the world economy and economic disparities between Romania and advanced European economies has fueled further emigration from the country. The emigration has caused social changes in Romania, whereby the parents would leave for Western Europe to escape poverty and provide a better standard of living for their children, who have been left behind. Some children are left <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> by grandparents and relatives; and some live alone, if the parents deem them to be reasonably self-sufficient. Subsequently, the youth began to be called Euro-orphans.|$|E

[...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E

500|$|A further {{provision}} for local education in Virginia {{was included in}} an act passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1818 stating that: [...] "It shall be {{the duty of the}} courts of the several counties, cities, and corporate towns—in the month of October or as soon thereafter as may be—to appoint not less than five or more than fifteen discreet persons to be called school commissioners." [...] The commissioners who were appointed in Hampshire County were John McDowell, David Gibson, John Pierce, John Randalls, Elisha Thompson, Charles Keller, Frederick Sheets, James Abernathy, and Robert Sherard. Accounts rendered to the Hampshire County court for the expenditure of the Literary Fund illustrated that [...] "the average price of tuition, exclusive of books, paper, etc. has been within a small fraction of four cents for every day of each attendance for each poor child." [...] Because nearly 700 impoverished children in Hampshire County were entitled to the fund, each child was only able to receive only a few months' worth of schooling, and because of the limited facilities, only about half {{of the total number of}} eligible children were able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> at each of the two periods of enrollment.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the 6000th episode of Neighbours would see Paul pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. This then kicks off a whodunit storyline with Diana being one of six suspects.

Badler said it was [...] "great" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline and said she was largely featured in the 6000th episode. [...] Diana becomes a suspect in the attempt on Paul's life because he jilts her [...] "in the boardroom and the bedroom". Paul then humiliates Diana and sends her packing from Lassiter's.

[...] Diana is seen placing a call asking for something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> and she hands money over to a stranger just before Paul is pushed. Following the attempt on Paul's life, Diana's earring is found at the scene and the police manage to catch her at the airport before she returns to America.

Kohli, at first, was dropped by Azhar Ali at first slip. But it took just one ball to get Kohli's outside edge, where he was caught at point by Shadab Khan. Amir got his third after he bowled cross seamer to Dhawan for 21. Amir finished with the figures of 3/16 (6). It was Amir's dream spell as his side bowled out the defending champions for 158, winning by 180 runs.|$|E

Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) had not recovered from her heartbreak at being dumped by Paul hours after their wedding in 2006. Paul also destroyed her daughter, Steph's life by exposing her secret. Lyn was heard commenting that the world would be better off without Paul around. Diana Marshall became a suspect after Paul jilted her [...] "in the boardroom and the bedroom".

2500|$|Two leading feminist Muslim {{scholars}} {{who are seeking}} to increase women's rights through the reinterpretation of religious texts are Amina Wadud and Asma Barlas. [...] Both women embrace Islam as a religion that preaches gender equality. [...] They see societal practices, not Islam, as the main problem. [...] Wadud points out the three reasons that the Qur'an views as acceptable forms of polygyny: if the husband is not sexually satisfied he may take another wife rather than turn to prostitutes or an affair, if the first wife is unable to reproduce or another woman with child needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of,</b> and/or if the husband is financially stable enough to care for another woman in the Muslim community. According to Wadud, the form of polygyny that the Qur'an supports focuses on [...] "justice: dealing justly, managing funds justly, justice to the orphans, and justice to the wives." [...] Barlas, who published her theological research several years later, argues a very similar point. [...] Both feminist scholars point out {{the origin of the}} Islamic theory of polygyny in Ayah 4:3. [...] This verse of the Qur'an was not meant to utilize polygyny as a way to oppress women, but to ensure that they were taken care of.|$|E
