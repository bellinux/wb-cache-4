5|$|Real maggots {{were used}} during {{many of the}} scenes, which were {{described}} by Gillian Anderson as being the hardest animals to work with on the show. The show's special effects producers were unable to create a full body replica of the first victim in time, requiring him <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> an autopsy table with makeup applied while the maggots were poured on to him. Rice was used {{in place of the}} maggots during some of the scenes. The car crash {{at the end of the}} entry was described by stunt coordinator Tony Morelli as the most harrowing action sequence during the show's third season. To give the episode a different look the producers applied a green palette to the film in post-production.|$|E

25|$|Alex Koslov put his {{recently}} won AAA Cruiserweight Championship {{on the line}} in the third PPV match of the night as he wrestled against Extreme Tiger, Crazy Boy and Alan Stone in a Elimination hardcore match. The match saw the frequent use of both tables and ladders throughout the match, mixed in with steel chairs for good measure. Koslov's reign as the first AAA Cruiserweight champion ended after just over two weeks as he was the first man eliminated from the match, pinned by Alan Stone. With Koslov eliminated it was a guarantee {{that there would be a}} new champion by the end of the match. Alan Stone's inexperience in Hardcore matches caused him to be eliminated secondly, leaving Crazy Boy and Extreme Tiger, both of whom had a great deal of experience with hardcore matches. The final section of the match had several slow sections where one wrestler set up a table, a ladder or an elaborate chair set up while the other wrestler had <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the mat and pretend to be knocked down. At one point Crazy Boy very obviously pushed himself into position so that Extreme Tiger could execute a leap off the top rope onto him. In the final moments of the match saw Extreme Tiger leap out of the ring and splash Crazy Boy through a table. After taking a moment to recover Extreme Tiger was able to get back in the ring, only seconds before the referee counted Crazy Boy out. With the count out victory Extreme Tiger was declared the new AAA Cruiserweight champion.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking {{me out of the}} game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E

[...] These include freedom from hunger, discomfort, pain, distress, and freedom to express normal behavior. [...] Sows that have <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> concrete flooring can experience excessive heat loss and chronic physical discomfort, while this same concrete flooring can contribute to foot injuries, joint pain complications, and skin lesions [...] - due to the pigs prolonged contact with an unusually hard surface and chronic inactivity.|$|E

[...] Despite the orders to forgo overcoats, cloaks, and blankets, the men were instructed <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> their stomachs on the cold, damp grass. [...] Although the original orders gave the battle starting time as 4 am, the soldiers were not completely in place until about 5 am. [...] Some were stationed within [...] of the Alamo.

2500|$|Controversy {{seemed to}} trail {{him during his}} prelacies. [...] He loved pageantry, {{creating}} speculation that he had high church views. [...] However, when a high church priest protested that incense was needed for curing souls, Creighton burst out, [...] "And you think that souls like herring cannot be cured without smoke?" [...] His moderate views—equally opposed to radical evangelicals and conservative Anglo-Catholics—endeared him to Queen Victoria. [...] Creighton's work ethic, though, was anything but moderate. [...] He seldom refused offers of additional responsibility, confessing more than once to both an abiding fatalism about being saddled with more responsibility and guilt about shirking from it. [...] Perhaps recognising this, a canon of St Paul's, while welcoming Creighton to the diocese of London in 1897, ominously remarked, [...] "It is a frightful burden <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> you: I hope you will use up everybody except yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarke's line {{played against}} {{the line of}} the Soviets' top player, Valeri Kharlamov, during the entire series. After being on the {{receiving}} end of some stick work from Kharlamov while going for the puck, Clarke caught up with Kharlamov and laid a two-handed slash across his ankle, breaking it in the process. Though Kharlamov finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth. When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, [...] "If I hadn't learned <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." [...] 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, [...] "the low point of the series." [...] Clarke responded saying that he thought it was [...] "improper to criticize a teammate thirty years later," [...] and that he did not [...] "understand why he would bring it up now." [...] Henderson has since retracted his criticism. Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with [...] "taking me out of the game." [...] John Ferguson, Sr., an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, [...] "I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it. And I sure wasn't going to ask Henderson."
