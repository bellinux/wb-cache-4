5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 March, the prisoners enacted their plan. Serious {{problems}} arose immediately. The tunnel hatch proved difficult <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> the tunnel exit was several metres short of the relatively safe forested area. These problems led to delays and only 76 POWs managed to make their break for freedom. As originally intended, Marcinkus {{was one of the}} first ten to escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Woodfull {{was promoted}} <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> his consistent performances in all conditions {{meant that he}} was to play there {{for the rest of his}} career. Between 1922 and 1926, he accumulated over 3,000 first-class runs at an average of 67.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} chess {{rules do}} not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand <b>to</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} cottages on the estate, {{the first of}} which, The Beeches, was built for the Fox family. Swiss Cottage, which was built in 1819, was {{originally}} known as Carysfoot Cottage, when the Earl of Carysfort was a patient there. Lanesborough Cottage was built as accommodation for Lord Lanesborough. The lodge house was originally called the wheelhouse as it contained the mechanism used <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> close the iron gates to the asylum. A garden alcove dating from around 1820 is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|MacPaint 2.0 was {{released}} on January 11, 1988 by Claris. It added many improvements to the software, including the capability <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> use up to nine documents simultaneously. The original MacPaint operated as a single-document application with a non-movable window. MacPaint 2.0 eliminated this limitation, introducing a fully functioning document window, which could be sized up to 8 x 10". Several other features were introduced, such as a Zoom tool, MagicEraser tool for undo actions and stationary documents. MacPaint 2.0 was developed by David Ramsey, a developer at Claris. MacPaint 2.0 was sold for US$125, with a US$25 upgrade available for existing users of MacPaint. Claris discontinued technical support for the original MacPaint in 1989. Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales. There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who wished {{to be able to}} use the program.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1944, Foskett was {{returning}} to base following an operation when his Spitfire developed engine trouble between the islands of Skiathos and Skópelos over the Aegean Sea. He attempted to bail out of the aircraft, but his altitude was too low for his parachute <b>to</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> he was consequently killed. Foskett's body was later recovered, and he was buried at sea; he is commemorated on the Malta Memorial. Foskett's younger brother Bruce William, a Royal Australian Air Force navigator, {{had been killed in}} an operation over Berlin the previous February. By the time of his death, Foskett had been officially credited with a tally of 6½ Axis aircraft shot down. For his command of No.94 Squadron, Foskett was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, which was posthumously announced in a supplement to the London Gazette on 1 January 1945. On 16 February 1946, Foskett's father, Edward, attended an investiture ceremony at Government House, Sydney, where he was presented with his late son's decorations by the Governor-General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.|$|E

5|$|Paratroops from 101st Airborne {{were dropped}} {{beginning}} around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve River. The C-47s could not fly {{in a tight}} formation because of thick cloud cover, and many paratroopers were dropped far from their intended landing zones. Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both flak and machine gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes {{did not have time}} <b>to</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> others drowned in the flooded fields. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared by members of the 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E

5|$|Walters Cultural Arts Center was {{designed}} to be a bookend, along with the Hillsboro Civic Center, to increased downtown development. The center is the city’s first dedicated arts facility. City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and other developments that include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> for art related festivals to develop to attract people to downtown after most businesses closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{traveling}} from Western to Northern Norway had to transfer from Braathens SAFE to SAS in Trondheim. Both airlines {{saw this as}} a strategic opportunity to get routes in each other's territories. On 31 August 1960, Braathens SAFE applied for an extension of its Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim route onwards to Bodø Airport and Bardufoss Airport. The two airports had been served by SAS from Oslo via Trondheim. SAS presented estimates that between 2.5 and 6.1 passengers transferred at Trondheim each day. Braathens SAFE later proposed that they could fly directly from Bergen and Ålesund to Bodø and Bardufoss, but Braathens SAFE's application {{was rejected by the}} ministry. All concessions ended on 31 March 1961, and the ministry extended them all one year. Three new airports, Alta Airport, Lakselv Airport, Banak and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, were about <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> the ministry wanted to award new concessions that included these airports. Braathens SAFE applied to operate to all the airports in Northern Norway, but the contract was awarded to SAS. The latter also applied to operate a route from Northern Norway via Trondheim, Ålesund and Bergen to Stavanger, while Braathens SAFE in 1964 again applied for an extension of the West Coast route to Northern Norway. This was moderated to a direct route from Tromsø Airport to Bergen, which SAS received permission for on 4 March 1965.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{extensions}} and realignment of the Canarsie Line were cancelled in 1973, due {{to community}} opposition against the proposed expressways {{that the line}} would have been built along with. Later that year, the LIE line was canceled because New York state voters had declined a $3.5 billion bond measure that would have paid for five subway extensions, including the LIE line. This {{was the second time}} that voters declined a bond issue to finance this extension, with the first being on November 2, 1971 for $2.5 billion. The defeat set back the construction of subway construction projects, including the Lower East Side Loop, the Utica Avenue Line, the Nostrand Avenue extension, the Jamaica Avenue Line, and the Northeast Queens Line. The 1973 bond issue, in addition to financing the LIE line would have also paid for an extension of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line to Co-op City, an extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Hillside Avenue and Springfield Boulevard, a joint LIRR/subway extension from the Atlantic Avenue LIRR terminal to Lower Manhattan, and a branch of the Queens Boulevard Line at 63rd Drive to the Rockaways via the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch. The double fare to the Rockaways would have been removed, and while this was not done as part of the bond issue, it was removed on September 1, 1975. However, the MTA believed that many other projects would still be built. By November 1974, the MTA projected a 1981 opening date for the Archer Avenue Line to Springfield Boulevard, as well as a 1982 opening date for the 63rd Street Line and for the SAS from 34th Street to 125th Street. In 1983, the Queens Super Express Bypass was <b>to</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> in the same year, the Bronx extension of the SAS and the BMT Jamaica Line reroute to Archer Avenue would open. The MTA thought that the SAS's southern extension to Whitehall Street would open by 1988, and that by 1993, the Utica Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, and LIE subway lines and the LIRR East Side Access would all open.|$|E
