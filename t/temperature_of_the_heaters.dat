40|$|Abstract: The maximum duty of {{reformer}} heaters {{is governed}} by the occurance of maximum tube skin <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaters.</b> The value of maximum tube skin temperatures of the heaters must not exceed theirs’ maximum allowable design temperature. The paper highlights the simulation of the tube skin temperatures of CRU heaters and temperature distribution across the heater tubes. The simulated results are important in order to access the heaters performance and prediction of the coke formation in tubes. The simulated results are verified using Plant data. The simulation is done using finite element approach. A two dimensional model is developed with a front view and a cross-sectional view for each heater.

40|$|We report {{disparate}} quasiballistic {{heat conduction}} trends for periodic nanoscale line heaters deposited on a substrate, depending upon whether measurements {{are based on}} the peak <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> or the temperature difference between the peak and the valley of two neighboring heaters. The degree of quasiballistic transport is characterized by the effective thermal conductivities of the substrate which are obtained by matching the diffusion solutions to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation results. We find that while the ballistic heat conduction effect based on the peak temperature diminishes as the two heaters become closer, it becomes stronger based on the peak-valley temperature difference. Our results also show that the collective behavior of closely spaced heaters can counteract the nonlocal effects caused by an isolated nanoscale hot spot. These results are relevant to thermal conductivity spectroscopy techniques under development and also have important implications for understanding nonlocal heat conduction in integrated circuits and carbon nanotube array thermal interface materials.

40|$|The initial, rapid {{increase}} in skin blood flow in response to direct application of heat {{is thought to be}} mediated by an axon reflex, which is dependent on intact cutaneous sensory nerves. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV- 1) channels, which are putative channels located on sensory nerves, would attenuate the skin blood flow response to local heating in humans. Ten subjects were equipped with four microdialysis fibres which were randomly assigned one of four treatments: (1) vehicle control (90 % propylene glycol + 10 % lactated Ringer solution); (2) 20 mm capsazepine to inhibit TRPV- 1 channels; (3) 10 mm l-NAME to inhibit NO synthase; and (4) combined 20 mm capsazepine + 10 mm l-NAME. Following baseline measurements, the temperature of skin heaters was increased from 33 °C to 42 °C at a rate of 1. 0 °C every 10 s and local temperature was held at 42 °C for 20 – 30 min until a stable plateau in skin blood flow was achieved. An index of skin blood flow was measured directly over each microdialysis site via laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Beat-by-beat blood pressure was measured via photoplethysmography and verified via automated brachial auscultation. At the end of the local heating protocol, <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaters</b> was increased to 43 °C and 28 mm nitroprusside was infused to achieve maximal vasodilatation. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated as LDF/mean arterial pressure and normalized to maximal values (%CVCmax). Initial peak in capsazepine (44 ± 4 %CVCmax), l-NAME (56 ± 4 %CVCmax) and capsazepine +l-NAME (32 ± 6 %CVCmax) sites was significantly attenuated compared to control (87 ± 5 %CVCmax; P < 0. 001 for all conditions). The plateau phase of thermal hyperaemia was significantly attenuated in capsazepine (73 ± 6 %CVCmax), l-NAME (47 ± 5 %CVCmax) and capsazepine +l-NAME (31 ± 7 %CVCmax) sites compared to control (92 ± 5 %CVCmax; P < 0. 001 for all conditions). These data suggest TRPV- 1 channels contribute substantially to the initial peak and modestly to the plateau phases of thermal hyperaemia. These data further suggest a portion of the NO component of thermal hyperaemia may be due to activation of TRPV- 1 channels...|$|E

40|$|The radial {{temperature}} {{around a}} sodium reactor heater assembly submerged in water is calculated using a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> cross section found by conformal mapping. Thermocouple readings were also analyzed. When the heat flux is 5 x 10 /sup 5 / Btu/hr-ft/sup 2 /, a radial <b>temperature</b> drop <b>of</b> about 680 deg C across <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermocouple well is calculated {{and found to}} be within 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental value. Since most of this drop is across the 0. 001 -in. helium gap between <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> and its sleeve, it is concluded that the thermocouple {{will have to be}} bonded to the sleeve for dependable reading <b>of</b> true sleeve <b>temperature.</b> Drawings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> assembly and thermocouple are given.

40|$|The present {{research}} focuses on <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> mass transfer resistance on <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> heat transfer in pool boiling. The nucleate pool boiling heat transfer coefficients for binary mixtures (ethanol-n-butanol, acetone-n-butanol, acetone-ethanol, hexane-benzene, hexane-heptane, and methanol-water) were measured at different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more volatile components. The systems chosen covered a wide range <b>of</b> mixture behaviors. <b>The</b> experimental {{set up for the}} present investigation includes electric heating element submerged in the test liquid mounted vertically. Thermocouple and a digital indictor measured <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heater</b> surface. <b>The</b> actual heat transfer rate being obtained by multiplying the voltmeter and ammeter readings. A water cooled coil condenses the vapor produced by the heat input and the liquid formed returns to the cylinder for re-evaporation. The boiling results show that the nucleate pool boiling heat transfer coefficients of binary mixtures were always lower than the pure components nucleate pool boiling heat transfer coefficients. This confirmed that the mass transfer resistance to <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more volatile component was responsible for decrease in heat transfer and that the maximum deterioration that was observed at a point was the absolute concentration differences between vapor and liquid phases at their maximum. All the data points were tested with the most widely known correlations namely those of Calus-Leonidopoulos, Fujita and Thome. It was found that Thome's correlation is the more representative form, for it gave the least mean and standard deviations<br /...|$|R
