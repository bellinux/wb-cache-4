5|$|Cyclone Inigo {{was tied}} with Cyclone Gwenda for being the most intense {{recorded}} cyclone in the Australian region in terms of pressure.

5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator.
