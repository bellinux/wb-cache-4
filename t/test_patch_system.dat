40|$|Background: A good <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> <b>system</b> {{should have}} good {{adhesion}} and contact, and minimal leakage; Finn and IQ <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> <b>system</b> have these properties but are expensive. Aims: To {{develop a new}} cost-effective occlusive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> <b>system</b> that had good contact with the skin and was non-irritant. Methods: The system (designated Chamber X) was fabricated using a semi-permeable tape and a flexible virgin plastic chamber. Chamber X was developed by (i) selecting adhesive tape based on its non irritancy and adhesive potential (ii) testing plastic chamber material for its skin irritancy (iii) testing the assembled system against Finn, IQ and locally available chambers for irritancy, contact, leakage and occlusivity. Results: Chamber X showed better occlusion than IQ, Finn and locally available chambers and was comparable to, (P > 0. 05) IQ and Finn in terms of irritancy, contact and leakage. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the Chamber X offers a cost effective <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> <b>system</b> comparable to IQ and Finn chambers in terms of safety, adhesion, leakage and occlusivity...|$|R

40|$|Epicutaneous <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> is {{the gold}} {{standard}} method for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. Despite this knowledge, many clinical dermatologists do not offer <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> in their offices or offer testing with {{only a limited number}} of allergens. Introduced in 1995, the Thin-Layer Rapid Use Epicutaneous Test originally contained 23 allergens and one control. In 2007, five additional allergens were added. This United States Food and Drug Administration-approved <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> <b>system</b> made <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> more convenient, and after its introduction, more dermatologists offered <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> services. However, the number of allergens in the Thin-Layer Rapid Use Epicutaneous Test remains relatively low. Every two years, the North American Contact Dermatitis Group collects and reports the data from <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> among its members to a standardized series of allergens. In 2005 - 2006, the Group used a series of 65 allergens. Of the top 30 allergens reported in 2005 - 2006, 10 were not included in the Thin-Layer Rapid Use Epicutaneous Test.

40|$|The {{elicitation}} of {{a positive}} <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reaction in a given individual depends upon the dose of the sensitizer applied, the <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> technique and the occlusion time. The dose {{is determined by the}} concentration and volume/amount of test preparation applied. If the same amount/volume of a test preparation is applied all the time with the same test technique (same area of skin) and occlusion time, it is appropriate to use concentration as a dose parameter. Most contact sensitizers are incorporated in petrolatum (pet.). With pet. as vehicle, it is impossible to repeatedly apply an exact volume/amount. This study was performed to investigate the inter- and intra-individual variation of pet. preparation applied at <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> by 3 technicians. Weighing demonstrated that the 3 technicians had about the same precision in their pet. application. The investigation demonstrates that there is both an inter-individual (statistically significant) and intra-individual variation in the amounts of pet. applied at <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> for the 3 technicians. Presently, there is no recommendation on what amount of pet. preparation to apply, which merits a decision to be taken based on thorough investigations on the appropriate volumes of pet. preparation to be applied in various <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Smaller drop volumes are produced by ethanol, hydrocortisone butyrate 1 % in ethanol, cocamidopropyl betaine 1 % aq., and propylene glycol 30 % aq. Filter paper saturation volumes using distilled water are 16 - 19 muL in standard Finn Chambers and 29 - 35 muL in IQ Chambers. Ethanol saturation volumes are slightly lower. Previously recommended volumes of application for aqueous allergens of 15 muL for standard Finn Chambers and 25 muL for IQ Chambers (slightly below the filter paper saturation points) are appropriate. Selection of dropper bottles should consider drop volume reproducibility, differing drop volumes for different allergens, and the <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> chamber <b>system</b> being used...|$|R

To illuminate the effect of circulating allergen-specific T cells in atopic dermatitis, the peripheral mononuclear cell response was correlated with the in vivo skin prick <b>test</b> and atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reactivity to M. furfur. None of 16 healthy controls showed any positive in vivo reaction. The 40 atopic dermatitis patients, of whom 18 had serum IgE reactivity to M. furfur, were subdivided according to their in vivo reaction to M. furfur extract into three groups: skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> positive (n[*]=[*] 12), skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> negative (n[*]=[*] 12), and skin prick <b>test</b> negative/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> negative (n[*]=[*] 16). The skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> positive and the skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> negative groups had a significantly higher peripheral mononuclear cell stimulation index than the healthy controls. Interestingly, the stimulation index values in the skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> positive group {{were significantly higher than}} in the skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> negative group. In the M. furfur skin prick test positive atopic dermatitis patients (n[*]=[*] 24) a correlation was found between stimulation index and the M. furfur atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reactions, but not between stimulation index and M. furfur-specific serum IgE levels. Skin prick test positive and/or atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> positive reactions to the recombinant M. furfur allergens rMal f 1, rMal f 5, and rMal f 6 were observed in 7, 14, and 16 of the 40 atopic dermatitis patients, respectively. Further, there was a correlation between production of the T helper 2 -related cytokines interleukins 4, 5, and 13 and stimulation index to M. furfur extract, but not between the T helper 1 -related interferon-γ and stimulation index to M. furfur extract. Our data strongly suggest a relationship between circulating specific T cells with a T helper 2 -like cytokine profile and positive atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reactions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn an inhomogeneous {{checkerboard}} surround, {{the lighter}} check darkens an incremental <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> {{more than the}} darker check lightens it. However, decremental <b>test</b> <b>patches</b> are influenced equally [Schirillo & Shevell, 1996. Vision Research, 36, 1783 – 1796]. In the current study, we manipulate the spatial arrangement of a checkerboard surround to produce T-junctions that perceptually group the checks with the <b>test</b> <b>patch.</b> These stimuli alter the inducing effects of the checks. For one modified surround, increments appeared ∼ 8 % darker and decrements appeared ∼ 10 % lighter over the original checkerboard surround prior to modification. In a second modified surround, that resembled White's illusion [White, 1979. Perception, 8, 413 – 416], increments again appeared ∼ 8 % darker, while decrements appeared a dramatic ∼ 23 % lighter over the original checkerboard surround prior to modification. These enhanced induction effects are postulated to result from the addition of specific T-junctions.

In particular the metric W unifies the pattern of discrimination thresholds for both increment and decrement pairs. We argue that while W provides a good mathematical description of Whittle’s data it is functionally implausible since it implies that the component of the stimulus which sets the adaptational level for increments is different from that which sets the adaptational level for decrements. We argue that the metric G = In(L/L,,) (L = <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> luminance.

40|$|Objective: Pain affects many cancer {{patients}} in advancing stages, lowering {{the level of}} their quality of life. Morphine has long been the “gold standard” for the treatment of cancer pain; however, its side effects, particularly sedation and cognitive impairment at high doses, have encouraged the use of “opioid rotation”. The transdermal fentanyl patch has advantages over oral morphine, with reduced side effects and increased convenience in practical usage. The side effects were reduced in patients who changed to the fentanyl patch, but rescue analgesia was often needed because of the decrease of fentanyl release from the patch, especially on patch replacement day. To maintain a stable fentanyl plasma level before patch replacement, we have established a three-cycle fentanyl <b>patch</b> <b>system</b> and reported that it provided appropriate pain control.

The 2 nickel materials were almost equivalent: 78 % of nickel-sensitive patients had positive reactions to both, whereas 11 % showed a positive response to 1 preparation alone. No variations in <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> responses in relation to application site were observed. Our data show that false-negative <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> responses to nickel are frequent. The use of 2 different preparations during the same <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> session increases the response rate by 10 %...|$|R

40|$|Background: Contact {{dermatitis}} (CD) is {{a significant}} problem among nurses. Although there are reports about the prevalence of CD {{from different parts of}} the world, data about its frequency in Turkey and about allergic contact sensitization among nurses is insufficient. Objective: To define the frequency and patterns of allergic contact sensitization and related symptoms in practicing and student nurses. Methods: There were 123 nurses in our hospital practicing in the in-patient clinics. All were {{invited to participate in the}} study. 69 working-in nurses and 79 student nurses participated in the study. The main reason for refusal of nurses was that they were usually having a shower daily after a hard working day and they had to postpone having a bath for 3 days if they had a <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> on their back. A ready-to-use <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> <b>system</b> (TRUE test®) with 29 standardized test substances was applied to all of the participants. History about symptoms of CD and allergic diseases was investigated by questionnaire. Results: While 34. 8 % (24 / 69) of practicing nurses had symptoms of CD, 19 % (15 / 79) of student nurses reported the symptoms (p= 0. 039). The most prevalent positive reaction was to nickel sulfate followed by thimerosal. There was no difference for positive reaction rates between practicing and student nurses. Nurses who had symptoms of CD were older than those without symptoms (p= 0. 003). The participants with symptoms of CD were more frequently from practicing nurses (p= 0. 047). Conclusion: CD is more frequent in practicing nurses than student nurses; allergic contact sensitization is not. This may be attributed to the length of occupation that is also correlated well with the length of exposure to the occupational irritants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{have found}} an {{increased}} activity of epidermal-derived thymocyte-activating factor (ETAF/IL- 1) and epidermal lymphocyte chemotactic factor (ELCF) in epidermis overlying a positive tuberculin skin reaction. In the present study, we investigated 20 patients with confirmed or suspected allergic contact dermatitis by using the suction blister technique before and during <b>patch</b> <b>testing.</b> The ETAF/IL- 1 was found in epidermis before <b>patch</b> <b>testing.</b> Its presence increased 2. 8 fold in epidermis overlying a positive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> compared with pretesting values. This increase was statistically significant. Interestingly, nontested skin also showed a significant increase of ETAF/IL- 1, which was 1. 9 -fold higher than pretest values. The ETAF/IL- 1 activity in <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> areas was significantly correlated with the clinical response. ELCF is not present in epidermis from noneczematous persons. We observed a significant content of ELCF in three of seven patients with eczema prior to <b>patch</b> <b>testing.</b> After <b>patch</b> <b>testing,</b> all patients showed ELCF in epidermis. Nontested skin showed a 1. 5 -fold higher content of ELCF compared with pretest values, and in the test area ELCF was 1. 8 -fold higher. The increases were statistically significant. We performed mixed skin lymphocyte reactions in seven patients using epidermal cells from the <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> area. All patients with a positive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> had an increased mixed skin lymphocyte reactivity compared with epidermis coming from a negative reaction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Patch</b> <b>testing</b> is the {{predominant}} method of establishing contact allergy. The present <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> technique {{is the result}} of a continuous process of development and improvement since its first application in the late 19 th century. The perfect <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> should give no false-positive and no false-negative reactions. The ideal <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> should also cause as few adverse reactions as possible, particularly no <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> sensitization. Even though the history and examination of a patient with suspected allergic contact dermatitis will give clues to possible sensitizers, it is not sufficient to <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> only with initially suspected sensitizers; unsuspected sensitizers used for <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> frequently turn out to be the real cause of the dermatitis. Fortunately, a small number of substances are considered to account for the majority of delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, generally 20 - 25 test preparations consisting of chemically defined compounds, mixes of allergens, and natural and synthetic compounds, are grouped into a standard test series. The requirements to be fulfilled by a sensitizer in a standard <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> series are discussed in this article. A procedure of investigations is proposed before a sensitizer is included in a standard series. status: publishe...|$|R
