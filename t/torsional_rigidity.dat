40|$|A {{new method}} to {{determine}} yarn bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities</b> was proposed in this paper. Measuring methods of yarn bending and yarn torsion were reviewed. The proposed method {{is a combination}} of theoretical modeling, instrumentation and statistical analysis. One major feature of this method is that bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities</b> of a naturally curved yarn, like those yarns in knitted fabrics, can be measured. With the aid of modeling, a recently developed Crimped Yarn Length Measurement Instrument (CLI) is able to measure both bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities</b> at the same time. The CLI generates a large amount of data points for the force and extension relationship during the decrimping of the curved yarn, multiple regression analysis was applied to determine bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities.</b> In this way, the experimental errors can be minimized and hence more representative results can be obtained. Experimental results from the new proposed method were compared with those measured by the KES-F bending tester and the KES-YN yarn torsion tester; good agreement was evident in testing results from both methods. The advantages of the proposed method were discussed including the capability of measuring the yarn bending rigidity at higher curvature.

40|$|In this study, simple {{expressions}} for the, anistropic rigidities of orthogonally rib-stiffened {{reinforced concrete}} slab structures are presented. These expressions are valid for both, the pre-cracking and post-cracking stages of concrete, and are, therefore, applicable to reinforced {{as well as}} prestressed concrete structures. Bending and twisting tests on several orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slab structures were conducted. The experimental results of twisting tests show that using shear reinforcement (stirrups) has {{a significant effect on}} increasing the pre-cracking and post-cracking <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities,</b> so proposed equations for estimating these <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities</b> were developed to properly account for the presence of stirrups. The experimental results of bending tests verify that using stirrups has no effect on both the pre-cracking and post-cracking flexural rigidities, so the existing equations for determining these flexural rigidities were not modified. The structural response of orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slabs to loads was observed. It shows that using stirrups leads to ductile behavior of such structures. The experimental procedure and the necessary precautions that must be taken to help ensuring accurate results were discussed. The use of realistic estimates for the torsional constants of rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slab structures when using shear reinforcement will lead to better design as well as economy.

25|$|A similar problem {{affected}} {{some models}} of the Supermarine Spitfire. At high speeds, the ailerons could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would twist in the opposite direction. This meant that the plane would roll in the direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, {{and led to a}} number of accidents. Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear. This was mitigated by adding considerable <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidity</b> to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced.|$|E

40|$|The torsion of homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic {{cylindrical}} bars {{has been}} the subject of numerous investigations from theoretical, computational and applied viewpoints. It is well known that in this case, the circular shaft is the only one whose cross-section does not involve a warping displacement in the axial direction. For an inhomogeneous, isotropic, circular bar, there is also no warping of the cross-section provided that the shear modulus varies only in the radial direction. For general anisotropic materials, torsion induces bending and vice versa. For those anisotropic materials with at least one plane of elastic symmetry normal to the axial direction, pure torsion is possible. For homogeneous materials of this type and special inhomogeneous materials, it has been shown by various arguments that no warping occurs for bars of particular elliptical cross-section.

40|$|Abstract. String-like {{objects in}} our daily lives {{including}} shoelaces, threads and rubber cords exhibit interesting behaviors such as twisting, tearing and bouncing back when pulled and released. In this paper, we present a method that enables these behaviors in traditional string simulation methods that explicitly represent a string by particles and segments. We offer the following three contributions. First, we introduce a method for handling twisting effects with both uniform and non-uniform <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities.</b> Second, we propose a method for estimating the tension acting in inextensible objects in order to reproduce tearing and flicking (bouncing back); whereas the tension for an extensible object can be easily computed via its stretched length, the length of an inextensible object is maintained constant in general, and thus we need a novel approach. Third, we introduce an optimized grid-based collision detection for an efficient computation of collisions. We demonstrate that our method allows visually plausible animations of string-like objects made of various materials and is a fast framework for interactive applications such as games. ...|$|R

The dynamic composite beam with with an axial load centroid, {{has been carried out}} using Special cases, that been identified and stiffness matrix for a thin-walled geometric and material coupling together (compressive or tensile) applied at the developed. An exact analysis was then the derived dynamic stiffness matrix. are derivatives of the general case have discussed. A three stage program was developed to compute various static and dynamic properties of thin-walled closed or open section composite beams. In the first stage, equivalent elastic constants (overall laminate moduli) were evaluated for a given stacking sequence and material properties. In the second stage, various sectional properties were computed. When the outputs from these two stages were combined, valuable data on sectional rigidities, mass per unit length, polar mass moment of inertia, and shear centre location from the centroid were obtained. In the third stage of the program, all these properties were used to compute the natural frequencies and normal mode shapes of thin-walled composite structures. These programs can be used individually as well as in a combined manner. An experimental investigation of composite thin plates with varying degrees of bending-torsion coupling was conducted. Flexural and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities,</b> natural frequencies, normal mode shapes and flutter speed and frequency were experimentally determined. The results obtained were in close agreement with the theoretical predictions. Various open composite sections were experimentally studied for their static and dynamic properties. The results demanded a more refined investigation of the theory. In addition to the experimental study of composite open sections, a parametric study of uncoupled and coupled frequencies of such sections with common boundary conditions was also conducted. Thin-walled closed aerofoil shaped cantilevered structures were tested to establish flexural and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities,</b> shear centre, and the polar-mass-moment of inertia.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis was}} performed on the linear dynamic equations of thin cylindrical shells to find the error committed by the Donnell assumption and the neglect of inplane inertia. The Donnell approximation was found to be valid at high frequencies as compared to the ring frequencies, for all admissible sets of boundary conditions for finite length thin shells. The error from neglecting tangential inertia is appreciable for long circumferential and axial wave lengths, independent of shell thickness. The effect of boundary conditions was investigated from an exact solution of the linear eigenvalue problem. The inplane boundary conditions proved to be very influential in the neighborhood of the minimum frequency. An approximate technique which accounts for the inplane boundary conditions was then developed and shown to be in good agreement with the exact solution. Finally, the effect of an elastic end ring on the eigenfrequencies was studied. The out-of-plane and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities</b> of the ring were found to govern the overall shell stiffness.

40|$|International audienceComputational and {{structural}} {{studies have been}} indispensable in investigating the molecular origins of actin filament mechanical properties and modulation by the regulatory severing protein cofilin. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of cofilactin filament structures determined by electron cryomicroscopy reveal how cofilin enhances the bending and twisting compliance of actin filaments. Continuum mechanics models suggest that buckled cofilactin filaments localize elastic energy at boundaries between bare and cofilin-decorated segments because of their nonuniform elasticity, thereby accelerating filament severing. Here, we develop mesoscopic length-scale (cofil) actin filament models and evaluate the effects of compressive and twisting loads on strain energy distribution at specific interprotein interfaces. The models reliably capture the filament bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities</b> and intersubunit <b>torsional</b> flexibility measured experimentally with purified protein components. Buckling is predicted to enhance cofilactin filament severing with minimal effects on cofilin occupancy, whereas filament twisting enhances cofilin dissociation without compromising filament integrity. Preferential severing at actin-cofilactin boundaries of buckled filaments is more prominent than predicted by continuum models because of the enhanced spatial resolution. The models developed here will be valuable for evaluating the effects of filament shape deformations on filament stability and interactions with regulatory proteins, and analysis of single filament manipulation assays...|$|R
40|$|The {{affinity}} of the Escherichia coli phage 434 operator for phage 434 repressor {{is affected}} by changes in the sequence of the noncontacted base pairs near the operator's center. The results presented here show that base composition {{near the center of}} the operator affects the operator's affinity for repressor by altering the ease with which the operator can be overtwisted into the proper configuration for complex formation. We show that both DNA flexibility and repressor flexibility influence the strength of the repressor-operator interaction: an operator with a single-strand nick at its center has a higher affinity for repressor than does the intact operator: and a repressor bearing a mutation that results in a relaxed dimer interaction is less sensitive than is wild type to changes in the flexibility of the operator. We show that the effect of noncontacted base pairs on operator affinity is independent of the slight overall bend of the operator seen in the repressor-operator complex. Central sequence effects on affinity for repressor are independent of the identity of adjacent base pairs, suggesting that the structure of the individual base pairs, not interactions between them, are responsible for the different <b>torsional</b> <b>rigidities</b> of different operators...|$|R
