50|$|The {{emergence}} of nanocomposite hydrogels allow for more site-specific and <b>time-controlled</b> delivery of drugs {{of different sizes}} at improved safety and specificity. Depending on the method of inserting drugs into the material, for example, dissolved, encased, or attached, the drug carrier will be named differently: nanoparticles, nanospheres (where the drug is evenly dispersed throughout the polymeric network), or nanocapsules (where the drug {{is surrounded by a}} polymer shell structure). The elastomeric nature of this material allows the hydrogels to obtain the shape of the targeted site and thus the hydrogels can be manufactured identically and used on all patients.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cooling method}} {{requires}} {{a very great}} technical effort and is unfavorable for mass production. In the electrochemical polymerization at first an auxiliary electrode layer on the dielectric has to be applied and {{to be connected to}} the anode. For this purpose, ionic dopants are added to the basic substances of the polymer, forming a conductive surface layer on the dielectric during the first impregnation. During subsequent impregnation cycles, the in-situ polymerization can be <b>time-controlled</b> by the current flow after applying a voltage between the anode and cathode. With this method a fine and stable polypyrrole film on the dielectric oxide layer of the anode can be realized. [...] However, both methods of in situ polymerization are complex and require multiple repetition polymerization steps that increase manufacturing costs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{good example}} of <b>time-controlled</b> noise gating is the {{well-known}} [...] "gated reverb" [...] effect heard on the drums on the Phil Collins hit single [...] "In the Air Tonight", created by engineer-producer Hugh Padgham, in which the powerful reverberation added to the drums is cut off by the noise gate after a few milliseconds, rather than being allowed to decay naturally. This can also be achieved by: sending the 'dry' snare signal to the reverb (or other process) unit, inserting a noise gate {{on the path of}} the reverb signal and connecting the snare sound to the side chain of the gate unit. With the gate unit set to 'external sidechain' (or 'external key'), the gate will respond to the snare signal level and 'cut off' when that has decayed below the threshold, not the reverberated sound.|$|E
5000|$|Petaluma {{pioneered the}} <b>time-controlled</b> {{approach}} to development. After Highway 101 was re-aligned as a freeway in 1955, residential development permits tripled, from 300 in 1969 to 900 in 1971. Because of the region's soaring {{population in the}} sixties, the city enacted the [...] "Petaluma Plan" [...] in 1971. This plan limited the number of building permits to 500 annually for a five-year period beginning in 1972. At the same time Petaluma created a redbelt around the town as a boundary for urban expansion for a stated number of years. Similar to Ramapo, New York, a Residential Development Control System was created to distribute the building permits based on a point system conforming to the city's general plan to provide for low and moderate income housing and divide development somewhat equally {{between east and west}} and single family and multi-family housing.|$|E
50|$|By 1924 {{they were}} able to patent a two-color process. The {{important}} part of that patented process was a process called controlled diffusion. By timing how long it took for an image to form in the top layer, but not yet in the next layer beneath that one, they began to solve the problem that Fischer could not. Using this <b>time-controlled</b> way of processing one layer at a time, they could create the dye image of the required color in only that layer in which it is required. Some three years later they were still experimenting using this controlled diffusion method of separating the colors in the multi-layer emulsion, but by then they had decided that instead of incorporating the color couplers into the emulsion layers themselves, they could be added to the developing chemicals, solving the problem of wandering color couplers. The only part left of Fischer's original problem with a multi-layer emulsion were the wandering sensitizing dyes.|$|E
5000|$|The 1917 Act was {{virtually}} silent on manpower projections and on centralized assignment of training quotas to school districts. If {{the driving force}} of the Act was labor shortages, one would expect it to contain processes to identify shortages and <b>time-controlled</b> means to meet them. Surely the 50-25-25 pro-ration of students' time fits the development of some kinds of skills better than others. The ultimate effect of the Act, though never stated explicitly, was to identify certain students and teachers as [...] "vocational," [...] and to protect the salaries of the latter by reserving for them (exclusively) certain amounts of Federal money matched by state and local contributions. Some critics infer that the authorities saw programs of practical instruction so endangered from a dominant academic elite that they required such protection by Federal law. The result, however, was to segregate academic teachers and students from vocational teachers and students and to strengthen the social alienation that early critics of these steps had feared.|$|E
50|$|Their second stop is {{a frozen}} ruin, where they find Captain Rose and her Goons trying to {{excavate}} some of Barbaros. However, the local creatures (along with a mechanical, <b>time-controlled</b> street-sweeper {{and the fact}} that the Goons themselves are not very clever) have led to their defeat or being trapped in a dangerous situation. After several encounters, they finally run into Captain Rose, who captures Wiki to unlock the chest (having deduced that Wiki is the key to the treasure she is after). However, before she can even use him, she inadvertently awakens the boss that guards the treasure: a giant head of a lion that breathes freezing breath known as Chillion. Using a complex light refraction system (of which Captain Rose becomes an unknowing part of when she becomes frozen by Chillion's breath), Zack uses its power to melt Chillion and free Wiki. The melting, however, also frees Captain Rose, who is extremely agitated for being used as a part of a monster-slaying mechanism. Zack and Wiki, however, escape with the treasure.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, several animal {{mechanistic}} {{and efficacy}} models have compared <b>time-controlled</b> PEEP to set PEEP. <b>Time-controlled</b> PEEP precisely controls the expiratory duration (100 th of second) using changes in lung physiology (i.e., {{the slope of}} the expiratory flow curve) (E 2, Fig.  2), and studies suggest that the expiratory durations determined by this method are less than the fastest time constant, which are typically < 0.5  s [37]. Studies from our laboratory using <b>time-controlled</b> PEEP (E 2, Fig.  2) vs a set PEEP in clinically relevant animal models of ARDS resulted in superior gas exchange, compliance, surfactant preservation, less microstrain, and reduced lung inflammatory and histopathology injury.

30|$|This paper {{improves}} our mechanistic {{understanding of}} lung protection using a ventilation strategy combining APRV, when {{used as an}} open-valve CPAP with a brief pressure release. If the pressure release phase is sufficiently brief, alveoli will be stabilized by two mechanisms: pressure and time. If the brief pressure release is set to less than the fastest alveolar collapse time constant, the alveolus {{does not have enough}} time to derecruit, and a <b>time-controlled</b> alveolar stability is generated. In addition, since the lung does not have time to fully collapse, an end-expiratory pressure is maintained generating a <b>time-controlled</b> PEEP. Some authors have suggested that auto-PEEP, {{or in the case of}} this study a <b>time-controlled</b> PEEP, is inferior to set PEEP because of heterogeneous alveolar collapse time constants causing the slow time constant alveoli to over-distend and the fast time constant alveoli to collapse. However, this hypothesis is based on theoretical, nonbiologic studies, using a single compartment model with a test lung [32, 33].|$|E
40|$|Electrospinning was {{initiated}} to fabricate <b>time-controlled</b> penta-layered nanofiber meshes which could show a multiphasic drug release. The drug ratio in each nanofiber mesh was kept persistent and each polymer content was electrospun at already determined time intervals. The drug release interval {{can be controlled}} by adjusting spinning time of each mesh. XRD and FTIR {{studies have been conducted}} to identify the state of drug and polymers, and also the chemical interactions between them respectively. In-vitro drug release profiles demonstrate that nanofiber meshes with distinct penta-layered morphological structure are capable of multiphasic drug release. Such type of <b>time-controlled</b> drug release system can provide a platform for the development of novel structures that can be used as multiphasic drug release systems...|$|E

40|$|The dry-coated tablet with optimal {{lag time}} was {{designed}} to simulate the dosing time of drug administration according to the physiological needs. Different compositions of ethylcellulose (EC) powder with a coarse particle (167. 5 μm) and several fine particles (< 6 μm), respectively, were mixed to formulate the whole layer {{of the outer shell}} of dry-coated tablets. The formulations containing different weight ratios of coarse/fine particles of EC powders or 167. 5 μm EC powder/excipient in the upper layer of the outer shell to influence the release behavior of sodium diclofenac from dry-coated tablet were also explored. The results indicate that sodium diclofenac released from all the dry-coated tablets exhibited an initial lag period, followed by a stage of rapid drug release. When the mixture of the coarse/fine particles of EC powders was incorporated into the whole layer, the lag time was almost the same. The outer shell broke into 2 halves to make a rapid drug release after the lag time, which belonged to the <b>time-controlled</b> disruption of release mechanism. When the lower layer in the outer shell was composed of 167. 5 μm EC powder and the upper layer was formulated by mixing different weight ratios of 167. 5 μm and 6 μm of EC powders, the drug release also exhibited a <b>time-controlled</b> disruption behavior. Its lag time might be freely modulated, depending on the amount of 6 μm EC powder added. Once different excipients were respectively incorporated into the upper layer of the outer shell, different release mechanisms were observed as follows: <b>time-controlled</b> explosion for Explotab, disruption for Avicel and spray-dried lactose, erosion for dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrate, and sigmoidal profile for hydroxypropyl methylcellulose...|$|E
40|$|A {{response}} reproduction {{paradigm for}} investigating numerical ability in animals is presented. In this experiment subjects were presented {{a number of}} light flashes (2, 4, or 6) in a sample phase, and were then required to reproduce that number in a production phase by pecking one key either 2, 4 or 6 times and then pecking another key once. Flashes in the sample phase were presented {{in one of two}} manners. Either one flash occurred every 2. 5 -seconds (termed the rate-controlled procedure), or all flashes occurred within a 10 -second interval (termed the <b>time-controlled</b> procedure). Two subjects were trained in each procedure. Following training, testing with novel probe trials (1, 3, 5 and 7 -flash sequences) was conducted. Novel probe trials, interspersed with baseline trials, were either presented {{in the same manner as}} the baseline trials, consistent transfer, or in the opposite procedure to baseline trials, inconsistent transfer. Reinforcement was delivered in a random manner on probe trials, and only for correct responses on baseline trials. In a second condition training and testing conditions were reversed, so that subjects that had received <b>time-controlled</b> training now received rate-controlled training and vice versa. All subjects learned to respond in the task with reasonable accuracy. Response distributions for the three baseline trials were distinct from one another and peaked at, or near, the reinforced number of responses. The introduction of novel probe trials disrupted baseline performance to varying degrees. In consistent transfer testing number of responses increased as flash number increased in an orderly manner for all subjects. During inconsistent transfer testing differences between rate and <b>time-controlled</b> performance emerged. All subjects maintained to some degree their baseline trial performance, however, time controlled subjects showed little discrimination between probe trials, while rate-controlled subjects made fewer responses to trials consisting of large numbers off lashes (5 and 7) than to trials consisting of small numbers of flashes (1 and 3). Examination of standard deviations of responses and coefficients of variation suggest that subjects in the rate-controlled procedure were relying upon temporal cues. Subjects Q 5 and Q 8 in the <b>time-controlled</b> procedure also appear to have used temporal cues. A confusion-diffusion model describing subjects' performance in this experiment is also presented. The usefulness of the response reproduction paradigm for investigating animal numerical ability is discussed and modifications to the present procedure are suggested...|$|E

40|$|A <b>time-controlled</b> {{navigation}} system {{applicable to the}} descent phase of flight for airline transport aircraft was developed and simulated. The design incorporates the linear discrete-time sampled-data version of the linearized continuous-time system describing the aircraft's aerodynamics. Using optimal linear quadratic control techniques, an optimal deterministic control regulator which is implementable on an airborne computer is designed. The navigation controller assists the pilot in complying with assigned times of arrival along a four-dimensional flight path {{in the presence of}} wind disturbances. The strategic air traffic control concept is also described, followed by the design of a strategic control descent path. A strategy for determining possible times of arrival at specified waypoints along the descent path and for generating the corresponding route-time profiles that are within the performance capabilities of the aircraft is presented. Using a mathematical model of the Boeing 707 - 320 B aircraft along with a Boeing 707 cockpit simulator interfaced with an Adage AGT- 30 digital computer, a real-time simulation of the complete aircraft aerodynamics was achieved. The strategic four-dimensional navigation controller for longitudinal dynamics was tested on the nonlinear aircraft model in the presence of 15, 30, and 45 knot head-winds.

40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) induces {{a complex}} inflammatory immune response, {{followed by the}} remodelling of the heart muscle and scar formation. The rapid regeneration of the blood vessel network system by the attraction of hematopoietic stem cells is beneficial for heart function. Despite {{the important role of}} chemokines in these processes, their use in clinical practice has so far been limited by their limited availability over a long time-span in vivo. Here, a method is presented to increase physiological availability of chemokines at the site of injury over a defined time-span and simultaneously control their release using biodegradable hydrogels. Two different biodegradable hydrogels were implemented, a fast degradable hydrogel (FDH) for delivering Met-CCL 5 over 24 hrs and a slow degradable hydrogel (SDH) for a gradual release of protease-resistant CXCL 12 (S 4 V) over 4 weeks. We demonstrate that the <b>time-controlled</b> release using Met-CCL 5 -FDH and CXCL 12 (S 4 V) -SDH suppressed initial neutrophil infiltration, promoted neovascularization and reduced apoptosis in the infarcted myocardium. Thus, we were able to significantly preserve the cardiac function after MI. This study demonstrates that <b>time-controlled,</b> biopolymer-mediated delivery of chemokines represents a novel and feasible strategy to support the endogenous reparatory mechanisms after MI and may compliment cell-based therapies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Time-controlled</b> {{rotational}} grazing (TC grazing) {{has been adopted}} in some Australian rangelands {{over the last two}} decades to provide graziers with a relatively higher herbage production over traditional practices. This grazing system, which involves short periods of intensive grazing, has raised concerns about the sustainability and environmental impacts on ecosystem health. Ground cover as an indicator of soil health and sustainability was measured over a 6 years period of study using a paired research paddocks treated by TC and continuous grazing practices in South-east Queensland. The results indicate that TC grazing achieved and maintained a higher average ground cover of 72 % during the study period compared with 59 % for continuous grazing. In the second period of the study (2004 - 2006), ground cover under TC grazing even increased to 85 % while in continuous grazing it remained at 65 %. <b>Time-controlled</b> grazing is also capable to achieve a cover level up to 92 % when soils are in good condition whereas in continuous grazing it's only 70 %. The improvement of ground cover under TC grazing in the study area is attributed to the effects of long rest periods providing exceptional chance of recovery and regrowth over wet season dominated by high frequency of rainfall events.

40|$|MOS-based RC {{networks}} {{capable of}} performing <b>time-controlled</b> Gaussian filtering. In these networks, all the resistors are substituted {{one by one}} by a single MOS transistor biased in the ohmic region. The design of this elementary transistor is carefully realized according {{to the value of}} the ideal resistor to be emulated. For a prescribed signal range, the MOSFET in triode region delivers an interval of instantaneous resistance values. We demonstrate that, for the elementary 2 -node network, establishing the design equation at a particular point within this interval guarantees minimum error. This equation is then corroborated for networks of arbitrary size by analysing them from a stochastic point of view. Following the design methodology proposed, the error committed by a MOS-based grid when compared to its equivalent ideal RC network is, despite the intrinsic nonlinearities of the transistors, below 1 % even under mismatch conditions of 10 %. In terms of image processing, this error hardly affects the outcome, which is perceptually equivalent to that of the ideal network. These results, extracted from simulation, are verified in a prototype vision chip with QCIF resolution manufactured in the AMS 0. 35 µm CMOS-OPTO process.
