5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E

50|$|A sensed end-stop uses {{some sort}} of {{electronic}} sensor to determine when <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> has reached track zero.

An opaque blade attached to <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> cuts <b>the</b> lightbeam just as <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> reaches track zero, signalling that <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> has arrived and is in alignment. Sensed end-stops are silent because movement of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> stops immediately after track zero has been found.|$|R

5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds. Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse {{more in a}} dense environment (such as foliage), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations. <b>The</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E
5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another.

Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E

5|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues.

Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental examination of <b>the</b> Falkinger (1996) <b>mechanism</b> for overcoming <b>the</b> free-rider problem. The basic idea of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> is that {{deviations from the}} mean contribution to the public good are taxed and subsidized. <b>The</b> <b>mechanism</b> has attractive properties because (i) it induces higher contributions to the public good and can implement an efficient level of contributions as a Nash equilibrium, (ii) the government budget is always balanced irrespective {{of the level of}} individual contributions, (iii) it is simple and policy makers need only little information to implement <b>the</b> <b>mechanism.</b> To examine <b>the</b> empirical properties of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> we conducted a large series of experiments.

40|$|A quadristable {{mechanism}} with a bistable structure {{embedded in}} a surrounding beam structure is developed. Three stable equilibrium positions are {{within the range of}} the forward motion of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and <b>the</b> fourth stable equilibrium position can only be reached on the backward motion. The quadristability of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> originates from combined compression and bending of the beam structures. Finite element analyses are used to characterize the quadristable behavior of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> under static loading. A design formulation is proposed to find the shape of beams of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Prototypes of <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> are fabricated and tested.
