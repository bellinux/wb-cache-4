5|$|Potemkin then {{embarked}} on a period of city-founding. Construction started at his first effort, Kherson, in 1778, {{as a base for}} a new Black Sea Fleet he intended to build. Potemkin approved every plan himself, but construction was slow, and the city proved costly and vulnerable to plague. Next was the port of Akhtiar, annexed with the Crimea, which became Sevastopol. Then he built Simferopol as the Crimean capital. His biggest failure, however, was his effort to build the city of Ekaterinoslav (lit. The glory of Catherine), now Dnipropetrovsk. The second most successful city of Potemkin's rule was Nikolayev (now better known as Mykolaiv), which he founded in 1789. Potemkin also initiated the redesign of Odessa after its capture from the Turks; it was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the greatest.|$|E
25|$|Except in closely fought swing states, {{voter turnout}} is largely {{insignificant}} due to entrenched political party domination in most states. The Electoral College decreases the advantage {{a political party}} or campaign might gain for encouraging voters to turn out, except in those swing states. If the presidential election were decided by a national popular vote, in contrast, campaigns and parties would have a strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere. Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade their friends and neighbors <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> vote. The differences in turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.|$|E
25|$|There {{still was}} no formal {{organisation}} of international tours, with any promoter free {{to try to}} put together a touring side. However, for ten years, only one team had toured for any one Australian summer. In 1887/8 this changed. Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury put together what was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be not only their last professional tour, but the last English tour led by a professional for sixty-seven years. Their team was invited to Australia by the Melbourne Cricket Club. Shaw himself did not tour, but stayed at home to put together a football side that played rugby union and Victorian rules (now known as Australian rules) football in Australia after the cricket tour. The tour was a financial disaster, with the Melbourne Cricket Club, Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury well out-of-pocket. Lillywhite defaulted on his debt. All the English team was mostly professional, to boost the status of the team, an amateur, Aubrey Smith, was invited to captain it.|$|E

500|$|Karofsky was {{initially}} {{used as an}} ordinary jock bully, but Adler's acting impressed show co-creator Ryan Murphy; he expanded Karofsky's role in the show's second season by having him especially target gay glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), only <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be gay himself, though closeted. That revelation sparked a wave of reaction from people who {{thought it was important}} for Glee to show [...] "the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted". Reviewers have been impressed with Adler's portrayal of Karofsky, including Michael Slezak of TVLine, who in the second season characterized it as [...] "surprisingly nuanced" [...] and with a [...] "terrific amount of depth", and Billboard Rae Votta, who wrote in the third season, [...] "As always, Kurt and Karofsky's scenes shine as the strongest in whichever episode they're featured." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{said that}} during this period, {{with all the}} changes on the team and with players {{returning}} from the war he had to [...] "re-establish myself as an NHLer." [...] Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy was going <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be just a [...] "wartime flash in the pan". Many of {{the players in the}} NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!" [...] was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens. The cheer, a howl that could be heard throughout the building, was performed by, the otherwise quiet, season ticket-holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal.|$|E
500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E

500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is going <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E

Matters came to head in October when Syvret submitted evidence to the court which he asserted proved that the 1999 police investigation had been a [...] "catastrophic failure". The prosecuting advocate argued indirectly that the quality of the investigation was not relevant. On 12 October 2009 the Magistrate stated [...] "I think the case would probably benefit from some clarity from both sides on exactly what the allegations are and what the defence is." [...] Syvret stated [...] " [...] it is abundantly clear that the 1999 investigation was in fact catastrophically defective, indeed far, far more so and more alarmingly so than even I originally thought.
