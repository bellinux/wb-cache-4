30|$|The {{first five}} highest {{frequent}} adverse events (headache, somnolence, nausea, dizziness, vomiting) in the BE studies were related with nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Probably, those adverse events could {{be based on}} the drug itself. In the adverse event forms most of the adverse events were recorded as irrelevant to the drugs used in the BE studies. While it can be speculative, some of the adverse events could be assumed to be triggered with psychological stress (Mayer 2000; Mönnikes et al. 2001; Nash and Thebarge 2006; Leistad et al. 2006; Cathcart et al. 2010). Some studies suggested that headache and functional gastrointestinal disorders might have psychological stress origin (Mayer 2000; Mönnikes et al. 2001; Leistad et al. 2006; Nash and Thebarge 2006; Cathcart et al. 2010) while fatigue and somnolence might have psychosomatic origin (Shorter 1993; Loge et al. 1998; Taylor et al. 2003). It can be speculated <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in a BE study, giving biological specimen such as blood all day long, and having no other activity could be unusual to the daily routine of a person and it is possible to trigger some adverse events based upon psychological stress (Shorter 1993; Loge et al. 1998; Mayer 2000; Mönnikes et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2003; Nash and Thebarge 2006; Leistad et al. 2006; Cathcart et al. 2010). Thus, the physical and social environment should be examined, and if necessary, {{in order to reduce the}} psychological stress that leads to adverse events, the prevailing conditions in the centers could be improved.|$|E

5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes <b>that</b> seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{detection}} of bone marrow involvement {{in patients with}} lymphoma is of crucial importance because of the prognostic and therapeutic consequences. Bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMB) is currently regarded as the method of choice {{for the evaluation of}} the bone marrow in lymphoma, but it is invasive, has a risk of complications, and lacks sufficient sensitivity due to the possibility of sampling errors.
