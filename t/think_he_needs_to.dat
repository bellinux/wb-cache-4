The patterns of technological innovation are studied by Economics of innovation. The aim of this paper is to prove that the origins of the Economics of innovation go back to many years before Schumpeter’s theory (1911), thank to the original studies of Rae. He really did not know much of any economics literature and developed most of his concepts on his own. J. Rae has recently been rediscovered as a genuine precursor of the endogenous growth theory. I <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be rediscovered a second time for his contribution to the understanding of the economic role played by {{the innovation}} and technology change within the economic system. The Scottish philosopher within his book Statement of Some New Principles on the Subject of Political Economy, issued in 1834, put forward the basis of the Economics of innovation individuating the nature, causes and effects of the technological progress on economic growth. The main results achieved are the importance of Rae’s work for the Economics of innovation and a definition of this branch which embodied the main concepts appeared during the history of the economic thought. Clearly, it is not complete definition, but it is the first step towards a completely individuation of the purpose of this important field of specialisation within the Economics...|$|E
