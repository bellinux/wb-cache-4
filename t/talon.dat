5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as <b>Talon</b> at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E

5|$|To reduce {{operating}} costs and lengthen the F-22's service life, some pilot training sorties are performed using flight simulators, while the T-38 <b>Talon</b> {{is used for}} adversary training. DoD budget cuts led to F-22 demonstration flights being halted in 2013 before resuming in 2014. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} the F-22's maintenance demands have increased as the fleet aged, the stealth coatings being particularly demanding.|$|E

The tactic is successful until Admiral Pellaeon and the smuggler <b>Talon</b> Karrde—on opposing sides but desiring peace—expose Flim. Meanwhile, at a fortress called the Hand of Thrawn, Luke and Mara discover a gestating and near-complete clone of Thrawn, which is killed during their escape.|$|E

5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the <b>talon</b> was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|Overwatch {{announcement}} video, in 2014, {{contained a}} stray {{reference to a}} gauntlet. Following its obsessive popularity with fans, the developer, Blizzard Entertainment, expanded the gauntlet into a full-fledged, playable character.

In Doomfist's fictional backstory, the playable character became the third generation to wield the gauntlet, and {{is presented as a}} villain after killing his predecessor and becoming a leader of <b>Talon,</b> the game's nemesis group. A digital comic accompanied the character's release.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] San Antonio <b>Talons</b> {{season was}} the 12th {{season for the}} franchise, and the third in the Arena Football League. This was the first season for the <b>Talons</b> in San Antonio, Texas after {{relocating}} from Tulsa, Oklahoma following the 2011 season. The team was coached by Lee Johnson and played their home games at the Alamodome. The <b>Talons</b> finished the regular season with a 14-4 record, winning the Central Division and securing the top seed in the National Conference.

25|$|Little spotted kiwis eat grubs {{and other}} small insects that are found underground, and {{occasionally}} eat berries. Hence the sharp <b>talons</b> and long beak, it digs into the ground with its <b>talons</b> then shoves its long beak down the soft ground. Since they can't fly to get to insects or food on trees and their eyesight is very poor they depend on {{a keen sense of}} smell, long beak and <b>talons.</b>|$|R
5|$|The 1966 NASA T-38 crash {{occurred}} when a NASA Northrop T-38 <b>Talon</b> crashed at Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri, on February 28, 1966, killing two Project Gemini astronauts, Elliot See and Charles Bassett. The aircraft, piloted by See, {{crashed into the}} McDonnell Aircraft building where their Gemini 9 spacecraft was being assembled. The weather was poor with rain, snow, fog, and low clouds. A NASA panel, headed by the Chief of the Astronaut Office, Alan Shepard, investigated the crash. While the panel considered possible medical issues or aircraft maintenance problems, {{in addition to the}} weather and air traffic control factors, the end verdict was that the crash was caused by pilot error.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat <b>Talon</b> IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of the carnivores, the family Canidae is {{represented}} by the two extinct subfamilies designated as Hesperocyoninae and Borophaginae, and the extant subfamily Caninae. This subfamily includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives. All living canids as a group form a dental monophyletic relationship with the extinct borophagines with both groups having a bicuspid (two points) on the lower carnassial talonid, which gives this tooth an additional ability in mastication. This together with the development of a distinct entoconid cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower molar, and the corresponding enlargement of the <b>talon</b> of the upper first molar and reduction of its parastyle distinguish these late Cenozoic canids and are the essential differences that identify their clade.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Tulsa <b>Talons</b> {{season was}} the 12th {{season for the}} franchise, and the second in the Arena Football League. The team was coached by Mitch Allner and played their home games at BOK Center. The <b>Talons</b> {{finished}} the season 8-10, failing {{to qualify for the}} playoffs. This would be the last season for the <b>Talons</b> in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The franchise relocated to San Antonio, Texas following this season.|$|R
