The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed <b>to</b> <b>process</b> <b>the</b> data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|Floating {{storage and}} {{offloading}} units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms and store {{it until it}} can be offloaded onto oil tankers. A similar system, the floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), has the ability <b>to</b> <b>process</b> <b>the</b> product while it is on board. These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity, and production versatility.|$|E

5|$|The flocculus {{sends out}} neural signals that produce small, {{automatic}} {{movements in the}} eye muscles. These keep the image on an animal's retina steady. Pterosaurs may have had such a large flocculus because of their large wing size, which would mean {{that there was a}} great deal more sensory information <b>to</b> <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> low relative mass of the flocculi in birds is also a result of birds having a much larger brain overall; though this has been considered an indication that pterosaurs lived in a structurally simpler environment or had less complex behaviour compared to birds, and recent studies of crocodilians and other reptiles show that it is common for sauropsids to achieve high intelligence levels with small brains.|$|E
5|$|Woolly mammoth ivory {{was used}} to create art objects. Several Venus figurines, {{including}} the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a boomerang, are also known.

5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and <b>to</b> <b>process</b> <b>the</b> fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, {{as part of}} an {{incentive}} to close unlicensed buildings in the regency, police posted notification that the Kampoeng Rawa site was unlicensed. The manager of Kampoeng Rawa, Agus Sumarno, stated that they had tried to gain permission for their buildings, but both the provincial and regional governments had stated that they were unable to issue it. When the police banner later disappeared, there were reports that the site's management had taken it down, although the management stated that it had fallen under a hard wind. The head of the Semarang Regency Council, Bambang Kusriyanto, stated that he had confirmed Kampoeng Rawa's management had applied for permission and called for the government <b>to</b> <b>process</b> <b>the</b> request expediently. In February 2015, President Joko Widodo called for the issuance of permits to be expedited, citing the site's potential to promote social empowerment.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis <b>to</b> <b>process</b> <b>the</b> {{hundreds of millions of}} board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E

The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.|$|E

A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the 9207 group was commenced in June 1944, but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed. Along with these main buildings, there were offices, workshops, warehouses and other structures. There were two steam plants for heating, and a power plant for electricity.|$|E
