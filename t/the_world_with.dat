50|$|Katja Grace {{argues that}} while SIA overcomes the {{standard}} doomsday argument, {{when combined with}} an assumption of a Great Filter, SIA leads to another kind of doomsday prediction.

In other <b>worlds,</b> <b>the</b> filter may be late—between the advent of technological civilization and galactic colonization. Collectively, <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>with</b> mostly late filters have many more instances of life at the human level of development, so SIA, together with the knowledge that we are at the human-level stage, implies we're probably in one of <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>with</b> a late filter. In other words, the risk of extinction is higher than we would have naively supposed.|$|R
