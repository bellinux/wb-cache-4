Rural Decline was the name proposed by botanists {{to refer to a}} decline in health of older trees in pasture and grazed shrubland, leading over many years to the loss of upper branches and eventual death.|$|E

5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>in</b> turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts had been made to tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|Insects, {{including}} beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, {{leaves and}} flowers of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta {{to hide in}} winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> many of these areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E
5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>In</b> Hawke's Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Under this {{sycamore}} tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, six agricultural labourers, {{known as}} the Tolpuddle Martyrs, formed an early trades union in 1834. They {{were found to have}} breached the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 and were transported to Australia. The subsequent public outcry led to their release and return. The tree now has a girth of 5.9 metres (19 feet, 4 inches) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680. The tree is cared for by the National Trust, who have pollarded <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> 2002 and 2014.|$|E

5|$|Ray's {{last three}} films, made after his {{recovery}} and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly indoors, {{and have a}} distinctive style. They have more dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People) is an adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of <b>the</b> <b>Tree).</b> <b>In</b> it, an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Sovereign {{class was}} ordered {{as part of}} the Naval Defence Act 1889 that was a {{supplement}} to the normal naval estimates. Royal Oak, named after <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> which King Charles II hid after the Battle of Worcester, was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was laid down by Cammell Laird at their shipyard in Birkenhead on 29 May 1890 and floated out of the drydock on 5 November 1892. She arrived at Portsmouth Dockyard on 29 October 1893 for fitting out, completed her sea trials in June 1894, and cost £977,996. Upon completion, Royal Oak was placed in reserve at Portsmouth. Almost two years later, she mobilised there on 14 January 1896 for service in the Particular Service Squadron, which was formed in response to rising tensions in Europe following the Jameson Raid and Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II's telegram of support to the Boer government. When the squadron disbanded on 25 November, the ship returned to reserve at Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of Boletopsis nothofagi {{seems to be}} strongly connected to the {{occurrence of}} the southern beech Nothofagus fusca, a species of Fagales that is endemic to New Zealand. B.nothofagi has been found exclusively in N.fusca forests spread through New Zealand below 37° S. The fungus forms a mycorrhizal association with the trees of N.fusca, in which the hyphae of the fungal mycelium wrap around {{the roots of the}} tree and penetrate the cortex, but not its cells. Subsequently, B.nothofagi takes over the function of the root hair and directs water and soil nutrients to <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>In</b> return, the fungus can, through contact with the root tissue, access the products of the tree's photosynthesis. The fruit bodies of the species have so far always been found in May, the end of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
