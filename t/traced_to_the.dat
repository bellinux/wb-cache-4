5|$|During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han {{immigrants}} brought Confucianized {{beliefs of}} Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan's indigenous people. Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han religious practices, {{though there is}} evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs. In some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (tongji) can also be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earlier matrilineal Inibs.|$|E

After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college.

5|$|The {{daffodil}} and the leek {{are also}} symbols of Wales. The {{origins of the}} leek can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd-George. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen, and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, {{the political and social}} consequences of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Languedoc wines can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first {{vineyards}} planted {{along the coast}} near Narbonne by the early Greeks in the fifth century BC. Along with parts of Provence, these are the oldest planted vineyards in France. The region of Languedoc has belonged to France since the thirteenth century and the Roussillon was acquired from Spain in the mid-seventeenth century. The two regions were joined as one administrative region in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} modern botanical gardens is {{generally}} <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> appointment of professors of botany {{to the medical}} faculties of universities in 16th century Renaissance Italy, which also entailed the curation of a medicinal garden.

5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, {{which in}} turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{became a}} center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local rock music scene can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the first of several best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of 20th-century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the {{development}} of East Coast ragtime, producing the legendary performer and composer Eubie Blake. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for jazz, and a home for such legends in the field as Chick Webb and Billie Holiday. The city's jazz scene can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a vibrant African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions, beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.|$|E
