40|$|Abstract – Factor {{analysis}} has been pursued {{as a means}} to decompose dynamic cardiac PET images into different tissue types based on their unique temporal signatures. In this work we present a kinetic model-based (MB) method that includes physiological models of factor relationships within the decomposition process. A gamma-variate model was used to describe the transport of 82 Rb in arterial blood from the right to left ventricle, and a onecompartment model to describe the exchange between blood and myocardium. Simulations of canine and rat heart imaging were performed to evaluate parameter estimation errors. Arterial blood sampling and 11 CO blood pool imaging were used <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>factor</b> and structure accuracy. Variable infusion duration studies were used to evaluate MB structure and global myocardial blood flow (MBF) reproducibility. All results were compared with a previously published minimal structure overlap (MSO) method. Simulation...|$|E

40|$|Time-course {{microarray}} {{experiments are}} capable of capturing dynamic gene expression profiles. It is important to study how these dynamic profiles depend on the multiple factors that characterize the experimental condition under which the time course is observed. Analytic methods are needed to simultaneously handle the time course and factorial structure in the data. We developed a method <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>factor</b> effects by pooling information across the time course while accounting for multiple testing and nonnormality of the microarray data. The method effectively extracts gene-specific response features and models their dependency on the experimental factors. Both longitudinal and cross-sectional time-course data can be handled by our approach. The method was {{used to analyze the}} impact of age on the temporal gene response to burn injury in a large-scale clinical study. Our analysis reveals that 21 % of the genes responsive to burn are age-specific, among which expressions of mitochondria and immunoglobulin genes are differentially perturbed in pediatric and adult patients by burn injury. These new findings in the body’s response to burn injury between children and adults support further investigations of therapeutic options targeting specific age groups.

40|$|Background: Strategies that {{children}} use {{for coping with}} stressors {{are known to be}} related to emotional adjustment, but not enough is understood about specific links with social anxiety and depression. The present investigation tested differentiated associations of social anxiety and depression with specific types of coping strategies, and evaluated the direction of these associations over time. Methods: In Study 1, 404 children aged 8 - 13 years completed a coping scale modified from Kochenderfer-Ladd and Skinner (2002) in order <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>factor</b> structure and subscale internal consistency. In Study 2, 270 8 - 11 -year-old children completed depression and social anxiety scales, a sociometric survey, and the coping scale from Study 1, with a follow-up timepoint 9 months later. Results: In Study 1, factor analysis revealed six internally consistent coping subscales. In Study 2, social anxiety and depression were found to have distinctive longitudinal associations with subsequent coping strategies. Decreased problem-solving, social support-seeking, and distraction were uniquely predicted by depression but not by social anxiety. Internalising coping was a stronger outcome of social anxiety, and increased externalising was uniquely predicted by depression. There was also some evidence for a moderating role of peer relations. However, none of the coping strategies predicted changes in depression or social anxiety over the two timepoints. Conclusions: These results highlight the impact that emotional adjustment may have on childrens coping strategies, and clarify important distinctions between social anxiety and depression in relation to coping.

40|$|Context: Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) was {{developed}} to assess objective and subjective symptoms in patients with cancer in all stages of their disease. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to translate and determine the psychometric properties of ESAS in an Iranian population. Materials and Methods: The current study was carried out to determine reliability and validity of ESAS using 246 patients with cancer in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ardabil, Iran. After translating the instrument to Persian, content and face validity, discriminant validity, internal consistency, and test-retest were done to determine psychometric properties of ESAS. Furthermore, the construct validity was determined using confirmatory factor analysis <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>factor</b> structure of the tool in two models: single factor and three factor. Results: With regard to goodness of fit indices including comparative fit index, incremental fit index, and normed fit index, factor structure of ESAS was confirmed with one factor and nine items. Because the values of average variance extracted of each dimension were less than the square of correlation coefficients between the three dimensions of ESAS, three-factor model was not confirmed. Discriminant validity was confirmed by finding significant differences between the two groups, patients with good general and critically ill conditions. Cronbach's alpha for the overall ESAS was 0. 88, and correlation between test-retest with 4 – 6 h interval was 0. 86 (r = 0. 86 P < 0001). Conclusions: This study showed that Persian version of ESAS with same factor structure mentioned in the original version is an applicable tool for assessing objective and subjective symptoms in Iranian patients with cancer...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study were (a) to test the {{validity}} and reliability of the health-supportive environment and culture scale, (b) to examine the validity and reliability of employee-based brand equity, and (c) to explore relationships among health-supportive environment and culture, employee-based brand equity, job satisfaction, and organizational citizenship behaviors by examining the moderating effect of job level. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey of 520 full-time employees (222 men and 298 women) from three places of the largest bookstore in Korea. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed to obtain factor structure and <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>factor</b> validity and reliability in Study 1 (Chapter 2) and 2 (Chapter 3). In Study 3 (Chapter 4), structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the proposed model based on Study 1 and 2. RESULTS: Psychometric testing demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency reliability, content and construct validity of the health-supportive environment and culture scale and the employee based brand equity scale. SEM analysis showed that (a) the worksite environment and culture for supporting health had an influence on employee-based brand equity; (b) the health-supportive environment and culture on our findings was not a driving factor of organizational citizenship behaviors; (c) employee-based brand equity affected organizational citizenship behaviors; (d) job satisfaction was influenced by the health-supportive environment and culture, and job satisfaction affected organizational citizenship behaviors; and (e) the moderating effect of job level (i. e., employees vs. managers) was partially supported in the proposed model. CONCLUSIONS: The health-supportive environment and culture scale and employee-based brand equity scale are both reliable and valid measures. Employee-based brand equity in the context of worksite environment and culture for supporting health appears necessary to establish organizational citizenship behaviors.

30|$|This study {{reports on}} the effect of artists’ paint {{formulation}} on degradation rates of TiO 2 -based oil paints. Titanium white oil paint exists in a multitude of different recipes, and the effect of the formulation on photocatalytic binder degradation kinetics is unknown. These formulations contain, among others, one or both titanium dioxide polymorphs, zinc oxide, the extenders barium sulfate or calcium carbonate and various additives. Most research performed on the photocatalytic degradation process focusses on pure titanium white-binder mixtures and thus {{does not take into account}} the complete paint system. Since photocatalytic oil degradation is a process initiated by the absorption of UV light, any ingredient or combination of ingredients influencing the light scattering and absorption properties of the paint films may affect the degradation rate. In this study three sets of experiments are conducted, designed using the design of experiments (DoE) approach, to screen for the most important formulation factors influencing the degradation rate. The benefits of using DoE, compared to a more traditional ‘one factor at a time approach’ are robustness, sample efficiency, the ability of evaluate mixtures of multiple components as well as the ability <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>factor</b> interactions. The three sets of experiments investigate (1) the influence of the TiO 2 type, (2) the impact of different mixtures of two types of TiO 2, ZnO and the additive aluminum stearate and (3) the influence of common extenders in combination with photocatalytic TiO 2, on the photocatalytic degradation of the oil binder. The impact of the formulation on the degradation rate became apparent, indicating the shortcoming of oversimplified studies. The protective effect of photostable TiO 2 pigments, even in a mixture with photocatalytic TiO 2 pigments, as well as the negative effect of extenders was demonstrated. Furthermore, the ambiguous role of ZnO (photocatalytic or not) and aluminum stearate is highlighted. Neither can be ignored in a study of degradation behavior of modern oil paints and require further investigation.|$|E

40|$|Anna Coluccia, Fabio Ferretti, Andrea PozzaDepartment of Medical Sciences, Surgery and Neurosciences, Santa Maria alle Scotte University Hospital, University of Siena, Siena, ItalyPurpose: The patient-centered {{approach}} {{to health care}} {{does not seem to}} be sufficiently developed in the Italian context, and is still characterized by the biomedical model. In addition, there is a lack of validated outcome measures to assess outpatient experience as an aspect common to a variety of settings. The current study aimed to evaluate the factorial validity, reliability, and invariance across sex of the Health Services OutPatient Experience (HSOPE) questionnaire, a short ten-item measure of patient-centeredness for Italian adult outpatients. The rationale for unidimensionality of the measure was that it could cover global patient experience as a process common to patients with a variety of diseases and irrespective of the phase of treatment course. Patients and methods: The HSOPE was compiled by 1, 532 adult outpatients (51 % females, mean age 59. 22 years, standard deviation 16. 26) receiving care in ten facilities at the Santa Maria alle Scotte University Hospital of Siena, Italy. The sample represented all the age cohorts. Twelve percent were young adults, 57 % were adults, and 32 % were older adults. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>factor</b> structure. Reliability was evaluated as internal consistency using Cronbach’s α. Factor invariance was assessed through multigroup analyses. Results: Both exploratory and confirmatory analyses suggested a clearly defined unidimensional structure of the measure, with all the ten items having salient loadings on a single factor. Internal consistency was excellent (α= 0. 95). Indices of model fit supported a single-factor structure for both male and female outpatient groups. Young adult outpatients had significantly lower scores on perceived patient-centeredness relative to older adults. No significant difference emerged on patient-centeredness between male and female outpatients. Conclusion: The HSOPE questionnaire seemed to be a tool with high acceptability and excellent psychometric properties to measure patient-centeredness as a unidimensional construct. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed. Keywords: patient-centered care, health care services, psychometric properties, patient-reported outcome...|$|E
