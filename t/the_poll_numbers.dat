2500|$|Chrétien called another early {{election}} {{in the fall of}} 2000, again hoping {{to take advantage of the}} split in the Canadian right and catch the newly formed Canadian Alliance and its neophyte leader Stockwell Day off guard. At the funeral of Trudeau in September 2000, President of Cuba Fidel Castro happened to meet with Day. Later that same day, Chrétien met with Castro, where Chrétien asked Castro about his assessment of Day and if he should call an {{early election}} or not. Castro advised Chrétien to dissolve Parliament early as he considered Day to be a lightweight, and as Castro was a leader whom Chrétien respected, his advice was an important reason for the election. Finance Minister Paul Martin released a 'mini-budget' just before the election call that included significant tax cuts, a move aimed at undermining the Alliance position going into the campaign. Chrétien formed a [...] "war room" [...] comprising his communications director Françoise Ducros, Warren Kinsella, Duncan Fulton and Kevin Bosch to gather material to attack Day as some sort of fascist who would plunge Canada into the Dark Ages, and to put forward the thesis to the Canadian people that Day had a [...] "hidden agenda", which was so horrifying that Day dared not to reveal it to the people of Canada until after he won power. In the first weeks of the 2000 election, the Canadian Alliance gained in the polls while voters expressed a certain coolness to Chrétien, whom most voters complained had overstayed his time in office and had no agenda beyond staying in power for the sake of staying in power. The fact that the Red Book of 2000 consisted almost entirely of recycled promises from the Red Books of 1993 and 1997 and various banal statements further reinforced the impression of a Prime Minister with no plans or vision for Canada and whose only agenda was to hang onto power as long as possible. For a moment in October 2000 it appeared possible that the Alliance might win the election as <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> continued in its favor. However, the Liberal claim that Day planned to dismantle the health care system to replace it with a [...] "two-tier" [...] health care system together with a number of gaffes on Day's part started to turn opinion decisively against the Canadian Alliance, despite the fact that most voters were growing tired of Chrétien. A CBC report on November 16, 2000, stated: [...] "Transport Minister David Collenette is said to have admitted at a strategy meeting that Chrétien is a problem and voters are saying they want Finance Minister Paul Martin to lead the party". However, the Liberal attacks against Day as a right-wing fanatic affected the voters more than did wariness with Chrétien. The climax of the Liberal effort to paint the Canadian Alliance as a gang of far-right wing extremists came on November 16, 2000, when the Liberal MP Elinor Caplan gave a much publicised speech, in she declared about the rank and file of the Canadian Alliance: [...] "Their supporters are Holocaust deniers, prominent bigots and racists". Leading a certain degree of credibility to the Grit claim that the Alliance was a party of racists was a speech on November 18, 2000, by the Alliance candidate Betty Granger in Winnipeg where she ominously warned that Canada was faced with the threat of an [...] "Asian invasion", by which Granger meant that Canada was accepting too many Asian immigrants for its own good. Historically, the fear of the [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] had obsessed Canadians which led to laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923, and Granger's [...] "Asian invasion" [...] speech hearkened back to the [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] fears of former times. Through Day promptly apologised, forced Granger to suspend her candidacy and insisted that the Alliance was opposed to racism, the damage had been done, and the Liberals made extensive use of the [...] "Asian invasion" [...] speech to suggest to Canadians, especially Asian-Canadians that the Alliance was a haven of white supremacists'. On November 22, 2000, Chrétien gave a speech in New Brunswick which in which he implied that people from Alberta were not quite normal, saying: [...] "I like to do politics with people from the East. Joe Clark and Stockwell Day are from Alberta. They are a different type".|$|E

50|$|Capital {{punishment}} {{is a legal}} form of punishment in Taiwan, officially the Republic of China. Before 2000, Taiwan had a relatively high execution rate when strict laws were still in effect in the harsh political environment. However, after controversial cases during the 1990s and the changing attitudes of some officials towards abolition, the number of executions dropped significantly, with only three in 2005 and none between 2006-09. Executions resumed in 2010. However, according to <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>numbers,</b> more than 80% of the Taiwanese people support to maintain the use of capital punishment.|$|E
50|$|In November 2005, {{the first}} report by Justice John Gomery was {{released}} to the public; subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> for the Liberals again dropped. Just days later, a new poll (Strategic Counsel: 6 November 2005) showed the Liberals were already bouncing back. On 28 November 2005, the minority Liberal government succumbed to another Conservative non-confidence motion supported by the three opposition parties and the writs for an election were dropped. The Conservatives achieved near parity but, early in the campaign, again fell back behind the Liberals. Renewed accusations of corruption and impropriety {{at the end of}} 2005 - amid Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) criminal probes concerning possible government leaks regarding income trust tax changes and advertising sponsorships - led to an upswing of Conservative support again and gave them a lead over the Liberals, portending a possible change in government.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> for the Parti Québécois fell sharply. The PQ {{government}} {{had been in}} power for two mandates and was seen as worn-out by some. An {{important part of the}} PQ's support went to the Action Démocratique du Québec and its young leader, Mario Dumont, and some to the Liberal Party of Quebec. It is under this dramatic situation for the PQ followers that Landry underwent a revitalization of the party and its image. The PQ was aided by the fall popularity of the ADQ's ideas as their conservative nature was uncovered, and by social democratic measures taken by the PQ government like the passing of the Act to combat poverty and social exclusion. The Parti Québécois succeeded in gaining back popularity in the beginning of 2003 {{to take the lead in}} the public opinion polls again. The PQ felt confident again to take upon a singular task: to become the first Quebec government in more than forty years to win a third mandate.|$|E

Despite <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> <b>numbers,</b> she cautions that recent boundary changes and the potential for shifts in public opinion and for polling errors mean that the election’s outcome is still anyone’s guess.

40|$|Abstract Election {{markets have}} been praised {{for their ability}} to fore-cast {{election}} outcomes, and to forecast better than trial-heat polls. This paper challenges that optimistic assessment of election markets, based on an analysis of Iowa Electronic Market (IEM) data from presidential elec-tions between 1988 and 2004. We argue that it is inappropriate to naively compare market forecasts of an election outcome with exact <b>poll</b> results on <b>the</b> day prices are recorded, that is, market prices reflect forecasts of what will happen on Election Day whereas trial-heat polls register preferences on the day of <b>the</b> <b>poll.</b> We then show that when poll leads are properly discounted, poll-based forecasts outperform vote-share mar-ket prices. Moreover, we show that win projections based on <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> dominate prices from winner-take-all markets. Traders in these markets generally see more uncertainty ahead in the campaign than <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> <b>numbers</b> warrant—in effect, they overestimate the role of election cam-paigns.

The discrepancy between <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> <b>numbers</b> and <b>the</b> election's ultimate results would come to be termed the [...] "Bradley effect", which refers to a hypothesized tendency of white voters to tell interviewers or pollsters that they are undecided or likely to vote for a black candidate, but then actually vote for his opponent.

50|$|At each polling station, tellers {{for each}} party will collect <b>the</b> unique <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> of voters from their <b>polling</b> cards.

'Promised voters' who have already voted are then crossed off the list of voters canvassed as supporting Labour.
