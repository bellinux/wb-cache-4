5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if someone else would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E
5|$|While {{long-term}} {{psychological and}} neurological studies {{have yet to}} yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, {{a few studies have}} provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope it will}} be a {{pleasant}} one," [...] said Wilson, after a pause, devoted <b>to</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> he might venture to offer to accompany her. [...] "Goodbye." [...] He held out his hand.|$|R
60|$|At first I fell <b>to</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> a {{stretcher}} or a clothes basket {{would be the}} more useful for the conveyance of Harris's remains back to the hotel. I consider that George's promptness on that occasion saved Harris's life. Being dry, and therefore able to run quicker, he was there before the crowd. Harris was for explaining things, but George cut him short.|$|R

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, the main areas of study were set theory and formal logic. The {{discovery}} of paradoxes in informal set theory caused some <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> mathematics itself is inconsistent, and to look for proofs of consistency.|$|E
25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 {{in a suit}} jacket and tie. The mannish appearance, uncharacteristic (in photographs) half-smile, and the knowing look in the picture has caused later commentators <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> Dolores was signalling {{that she was a}} lesbian, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that she was and her appearance at this time may simply have been a fashion statement. The photograph appeared, slightly changed, on the cover of Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture by Laura Doan in 2013.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] ses Bob Pretty, in a {{thoughtful}} voice, <b>to</b> Smith—"I <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> you or Mr. Cutts kicked ’em {{in the pond}} while you was struggling with me. Come to think of it, I seem to remember ’earing a splash." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{statement}} that it meant everything to him insinuated itself so frequently into his conversation that it weighed on Elizabeth's mind like a burden, and by degrees {{she found herself}} giving the play place of honour in her thoughts over and above her own little ventures. With this stupendous thing hanging in the balance, it seemed almost wicked of her to devote a moment <b>to</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> the editor of an evening paper, who had half promised {{to give her the}} entrancing post of Adviser to the Lovelorn on his journal, would fulfil that half-promise.|$|R
60|$|Here, then, {{was one of}} my anticipations of {{the morning}} still unfulfilled. I began <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> next, <b>whether</b> my {{introduction}} to Miss Fairlie would disappoint the expectations that I had been forming of her since breakfast-time.|$|R
25|$|Amlaíb {{is known}} to have built a {{fortress}} at Clondalkin, eight kilometres west of Áth Cliath. This was an important seat of Norse power for more than a century. Significantly, the fortress was built on the remains of an old monastic site, which has led some historians <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> a similar thing might not have happened at the ecclesiastical enclosure of Duiblinn. The annals are silent as to the ultimate fate of the latter settlement and its community – no Abbot or Bishop of Dublin is mentioned after 785; the possibility remains that it was abandoned in the late 8th century before the arrival of the Norsemen, who simply annexed it and built their longphort on the site.|$|E
500|$|Both Carstenszoon in 1623 and Tasman in 1644 were {{directed}} to attempt to find a passage {{in the area of}} Torres Strait, but failed. Following these explorations, [...] the Dutch continued <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> there was a passage: [...] However, Dutch maps still showed Cape York and New Guinea as being contiguous, until James Cook, who was aware of Torres' voyage through Alexander Dalrymple, sailed through the strait on his first voyage in 1770.|$|E
500|$|Rosaline {{is used as}} a {{name for}} only one other Shakespearean character—the one of the main female figures in Love's Labours Lost (1598), {{although}} Rosalind {{is the name of the}} main female character in As You Like It. [...] Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in Love's Labours Lost constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her. [...] These similarities have led some <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.|$|E

5000|$|In 1988, {{the book}} was reprinted and Manchester wrote a new foreword. People had come <b>to</b> him <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> he would update and modify his {{original}} work due to [...] "new developments" [...] in chronicling the story. Manchester wrote that, in his view, there were no new developments.|$|R

500|$|The {{first of}} more than a dozen Tornado prototypes took flight on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett stated of the occasion: [...] "Aircraft {{handling}} was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> this was not yet another simulation". Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds. Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts. In August 1976, Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the British Grand Prix at Gateshead {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} inaugural {{fourteen}} Diamond League events, but although competitors included Tyson Gay, Powell, Jessica Ennis and Vincent Chepkok, the attendance was unusually poor, causing the local press <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> Gateshead's contract for the marquee event would be renewed. Those fears were to prove well-founded when UK Athletics agreed to a three-year contract to stage the event at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. The move prompted one reporter to lament that [...] "the switch is a major blow to both Gateshead International Stadium and North-East sport in general, but can hardly be regarded as a major surprise given the dwindling support for major athletics events in the region." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord's {{invocation}} {{of an era}} of confidence and certainty was also a relevant theme {{at the height of}} the Cold War. The University of California sociologist Fred Davis comments that nostalgia [...] "thrives ... on the rude transitions wrought by such phenomena as war, depression, civil disturbance, and cataclysmic natural disasters – in short, those events that cause masses of people to feel uneasy and <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> the world and their being are quite what they always took them to be." [...] The turmoil and uncertainty of the early Atomic Age and the onset of profound social changes made the old concepts of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, reflected in the behaviour of Titanics passengers, resonate with a mid-1950s audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Changee for changee!" [...] Kwaque queried back, taking {{for granted}} {{that it was an}} offer <b>to</b> {{exchange}} and <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> the little old cook had become enamoured of his precious jews' harp.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{costs for}} the above trip are $X. Let us say you have $1,000 <b>to</b> invest and <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> it is worth taking a near-lightspeed voyage to {{increase}} your return 10 subjective years from now.|$|R
60|$|After a {{long time}} she heard a sharp {{throbbing}} coming up the valley. It sounded like a motorcycle and she jumped {{out of bed and}} began <b>to</b> dress, <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> Dick had borrowed the machine at Annan and was returning. The sound grew louder; the motorcycle had passed the lodge and was nearing the house when Elsie quietly entered Madge's room.|$|R
500|$|Gibson {{shows up}} at the Simpsons' door and invites Homer and his family to come with him to Hollywood to change the film. Homer and Gibson begin work on the film {{while the rest of the}} family explores Hollywood. When Homer's ideas prove to be stupid and pointless, Gibson begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> he made a mistake. However, he is {{enthusiastic}} when Homer tells him his ideas for the famous [...] "filibuster" [...] scene at the end. The next day, they present the new ending to the producers. In the new version, Mr. Smith goes berserk and slaughters every member of the United States Congress and the President in a mindless action movie sequence. The producers are horrified at this, saying that the film was meant to be the studio's prestige picture. They attempt to burn the new ending, but Homer and Gibson, determined to save their film, run away with the film.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Lee {{lying on}} a black {{background}} while lip-syncing the lyrics of the song, with shots of fellow members and the singer drawing lines with a light in her hand being seen. Following this, she gets {{up off the ground}} and starts creating grass around her with the light previously shown. Subsequently, she is portrayed drawing stars and walking through the world she has created. The next scene sees the singer playing the piano in a room with a small window, which Lee then touches to break and to illuminate the screen with white light. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, at the end, [...] "she eventually realizes that, in spite of her attempts, she is just as trapped as she was before [...] At [...] clip's end, the viewer is left <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> she has the power to escape [...] which, in a way, only further connects the video to the song itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Blue Gardenia was positive overall. Jonathan Widran wrote a positive review for the album, complimenting Walton's arrangements and the featured soloists. Widran {{also said that}} each track allowed James to [...] "explore both tenderness and guttural emotions" [...] and that James' mother's contributions to the title track provided a [...] "unique touch that [...] emotional dimension to an already emotionally rich affair". Music critic Robert Christgau awarded the album an [...] "A–" [...] rating and wrote that James [...] " [...] the songs do the talking and [...] you <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> her modest melodic variations bespeak sly musicality or weathered pipes." [...] Isaac Guzman of the New York Daily News thought that the album showcased James' ability to [...] "get inside the gentle nuances of classic torch songs and ballads". Dorothy Hill noted the blues sound of the album and the [...] "ache" [...] in James' voice. She complimented the performances by the guest musicians appearing on the album, including Hawkins, whose vocal contribution Hill called [...] "unpolished but alluring".|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{knew all}} about her!" [...] said Dorothea. [...] "I wonder how she bore the change from wealth <b>to</b> poverty: I <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> she was happy with her husband! Do you know much about them?" ...|$|R

500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, one is tempted <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> there is really anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, {{and to some extent}} elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E
500|$|Jackson and Presley {{appeared}} on the television show Primetime in June 1995. In Jackson's first interview since 1993 and Presley's first ever, Diane Sawyer quizzed the pair on their private life with, according to Jet, a series of [...] "insensitive" [...] questions. Presley boasted that she and Jackson had regular sex, following Sawyer's questioning their sex life. When asked if the marriage was a sham, Presley asserted that such rumors were [...] "crap"; {{she said she would}} never marry someone for any other reason than being in love with him, and concluded that if the public thought differently, they could [...] "eat it". The following day, Presley reflected that the interview had been a disaster; she had hoped the couple would be perceived as being serious, yet Jackson fooled around during the show, at one point holding two fingers behind his wife's head to make bunny ears. Presley's friend Monica Pastelle revealed that it was at this point that Presley began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> she had made a mistake in choosing Jackson as a long-term partner.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the football references, the episode parodies the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Homer tells Moe, who keeps his wallet in his shoe, [...] "I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory," [...] a play on {{a line from the}} film. In a commercial for his new television show, celebrity Troy McClure says that he plays [...] "Jack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. We're the original Odd Couple!", referencing the television show The Odd Couple. With his gambling winnings Homer buys Marge a bottle of perfume by Meryl Streep. The perfume is called Versatility and the bottle is shaped like an Academy Award. The Globe and Mails Liam Lacey commented on the similarities between the 2009 film Imagine That and this episode in a review of the film. He said the [...] "message in each case is about the dangerous confusion of love and money. Naturally there's a turning point [...] where the child begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> her father really loves her or just her profitable talent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been just the same feeling," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and there {{would have been}} an end of it. Now there is no saying what is going <b>to</b> happen. I <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> Jack was killed, and the sailors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor unfortunate young woman!" [...] said Mrs. Fletcher, {{holding up}} both her hands. [...] "I {{must say that}} I cannot but blame Mr. Wharton. If he had been firm, it never would have come <b>to</b> that. I <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> he ever sees him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forty {{thousand}} pounds' {{worth of}} shares," [...] Letitia continued, [...] "which are worth as much now as {{when my father}} bought them, are, I suppose, nothing <b>to</b> you.
