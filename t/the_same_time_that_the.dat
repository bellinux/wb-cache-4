5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Imbudo passed about 35km (20mi) north of Yap. The JMA upgraded Imbudo to a severe tropical storm late on July18, around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon. An increase in outflow {{to the south}} and to the north from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) caused a 36‑hour period of rapid development beginning on July19. During that time, the JMA upgraded Imbudo to typhoon status, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the Philippines, and a 30km (20mi) wide eye formed. At 1200UTC on July20, the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated 1minute sustained winds of 240km/h (150mph), making it a super typhoon. By late on July20, the typhoon had developed concentric eyewalls, and the TUTT was moving away, thus diminishing outflow. Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12hours, before the innermost eye contracted to a diameter of 11km (7mi) {{in the midst of an}} eyewall replacement cycle. At 0300UTC on July22, Imbudo struck northern Luzon, with 1minute winds estimated at 205km/h (125mph) by the JTWC.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first {{monitored}} {{an area of}} disturbed weather on September25. At the time, {{the system}} consisted of a weak circulation, but with good outflow and located {{in an area of}} low wind shear. The system moved to the west-northwest, steered by a subtropical ridge to the east of Japan. On September26, a tropical depression developed about 925km (575mi) east of the Northern Marianas Islands, and also to the south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima. Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Higos, at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> JTWC also upgraded to a tropical storm. By that time, the system had developed an organized area of convection.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Gilda {{weakened}} {{slightly over}} Cuba, crossing {{the island in}} less than twelve hours before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean early on October 19. At the time, the anticyclone over Jamaica which previously assisted the cyclone instead remained over the Caribbean, which increased shear over the storm. This caused the convection to gradually separate from the low-level circulation. Early on October 20, Gilda passed just southeast of Andros Island in the Bahamas, around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hurricane Hunters recorded an atmospheric pressure of 994 mbar; this was the lowest recorded pressure in association with Gilda while it was a tropical cyclone. It gradually weakened due to the wind shear, resulting in the low-level steering currents becoming dominant. After moving through the Exuma island chain, the storm passed near or over Eleuthera, and late on October 21 Gilda became nearly stationary about 60 mi (95 km/h) east of Harbour Island. Late on October 22, after moving only about 6 mi (10 km) in a 24‑hour period, Gilda weakened to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> No. 3 {{locomotive}} {{was placed}} into service in 1958, Roger Broggie {{decided that a}} fourth locomotive was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam locomotive to purchase and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable locomotive for sale in New Jersey, and after contacting the seller, Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the locomotive. Best was able to determine that the locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the Pine Creek Railroad in New Jersey, {{and that it had}} been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a new tender built by Fleming Metal Fabricators designed to hold diesel fuel. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 4 locomotive and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.|$|E
5|$|In December 1695 the Spanish colonial {{authorities}} in Mérida received a diplomatic visit {{sent by the}} Aj Kan Ek'. The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, alcalde of Bacalar-at-Chunjujub'. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpetén from Tipuj in April 1695, who arrived around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Itza were preparing to defend themselves against a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of submission to Spain. In August Hariza travelled to Mérida {{in the company of}} a group of seven Tipuj natives offering submission to Spain. Four members of this party were not from Tipuj at all, but were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities. The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza king. When friar Avendaño was in Mérida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpetén, he met with the Itza–Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpetén in January 1696. AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpetén in November but did not stay long before leaving for Mérida again.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, growing public {{opposition}} to the removal of feral horses prompted management strategy changes, and today the herds within the Theodore Roosevelt National Park are managed {{for the purposes of}} historical demonstration. However, in 1986 the park added outside bloodlines with the aim of modifying the appearance of the Nokota. Park management felt that the horses created with the outside bloodlines would sell better at subsequent auctions. The dominant herd stallions were removed and replaced with two feral stallions from Bureau of Land Management Mustang herds, a crossbred Shire stallion, a Quarter Horse stallion and an Arabian stallion. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stallion replacements took place, a large number of horses from the park were rounded up and sold. At the 1986 auction, concerned about the welfare of the Nokota horse, Leo and Frank Kuntz purchased 54 horses, including the dominant stallion, a blue roan. This was in addition to smaller numbers of horses purchased in 1981, 1991 and 1997. After researching the history of the breed, the Kuntzs stated that they had found evidence that the horses in the park were probably related to the remaining horses from the band of 250 Sitting Bull horses, who had been range-bred by the Marquis de Mores, who founded the town of Medora. However, the short-lived Nokota Horse Association claimed that there was no evidence for this claim.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of {{the hair on the}} lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E
