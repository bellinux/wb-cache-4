5000|$|The African-American {{community}} {{criticized the}} amendments because {{they appeared to}} help whites and provide few or no benefits to African-American students. Critics criticized the unequal representation of the races on the Pearsall Committee as {{the primary reason for}} the unbalanced plan. They believed that a committee with sixteen white and three black citizens could not fairly represent society. [...] Regulations related to the Plan proved a barrier to black students and some whites. A student wishing to challenge their assignment had to contact their school board directly; no independent bodies were keeping <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> to evaluate the performance of school boards as a whole. The appeals process required submission of materials related to distinct and detailed clauses that were difficult for uneducated and under-educated parents to fill out. If students' appeals were not correctly submitted, the boards would reject their requests. As a result of these factors, “most school boards denied every request filed by a black student to transfer from an assigned black school to a white school” until the early 1960s. Only one family was granted a monetary voucher for being placed into an integrated school. North Carolina lagged behind Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia in terms of the pace of enrolling black students in integrated schools. Many African Americans in North Carolina were dismayed by the lack of progress, as they had been hopeful about the Brown ruling being a catalyst for school integration.|$|R

40|$|Background Results of {{existing}} studies are inconclusive concerning {{the relationship between}} chemotherapy and subjective cognitive functioning (SCF). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate SCF of breast cancer (BC) patients and to find predictors of impaired SCF. Both satisfaction and frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF were measured. Methods BC patients who were about to receive chemotherapy (N[*]=[*] 74) and patients with a benign breast disease (BBD) (N[*]=[*] 63) participated. Before chemotherapy started (Time 1) and 3 [*]months after ending chemotherapy (and at comparable moments for the BBD group) (Time 2), women completed validated questionnaires concerning the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> and satisfaction with SCF, fatigue, perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results No differences were found between the BBD and BC patients concerning the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF across time. Satisfaction with SCF decreased across time in BC patients but remained stable across time in BBD patients (p[*]<[*] 0. 001; p[*]=[*] 0. 003 after controlling for state anxiety and perceived stress). Correlation coefficients between the satisfaction and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF ranged between − 0. 26 and − 0. 49. Depressive symptoms and satisfaction with SCF (Time 1) predicted the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF (Time 2). Diagnosis, frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF, and state anxiety (Time 1) predicted satisfaction with SCF (Time 2). Conclusions BC patients do not differ in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF compared with BBD patients, but their satisfaction with SCF decreased after treatment. Psychological factors predicted the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF. Psychological factors and diagnosis predicted satisfaction with SCF...|$|R
