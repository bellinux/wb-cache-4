5|$|In 2009, Scott {{left her}} former record label Hidden Beach Recordings. During the album's recording, she was sued by Hidden Beach, which claimed {{she had left}} without {{fulfilling}} a six-album contract. The lawsuit was settled in 2011, with Hidden Beach planning to release in August a compilation album The Original Jill Scott from the Vault, Vol. 1, {{the first in a}} planned album series of Scott's previously unreleased recordings.

5|$|In March 2006, {{contractors}} halted construction {{because of}} fears {{that they will}} not be paid. This caused Morningstar to reconsider their lease commitment. As a result, the value of the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult. Mills was close <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with German investment firm, Deutsche Immobilien Fonds A.G. prior to the difficulties. DIFA had outbid Chicago developer Golub & Co., which then became the frontrunner. Golub, an international real estate investment company headquartered in Chicago, has closed on the office space portion of the project. Mills eventually sold the retail space rights to Chicago developer Joseph Freed & Associates, who had previously purchased the nearby Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building (located at 1 South State Street) that closed in early 2007.|$|E

5|$|In September 1935, {{after seven}} years, Briskin {{resigned}} from Columbia, failing {{to reach an}} agreement with Harry Cohn over stock options. For years, many in the film industry knew that Briskin was responsible for many of the successes at Columbia, even though studio head Harry Cohn was taking the credit. Shortly after, reports began to circulate that he was headed to 20th Century-Fox. Shortly after that report, he was offered a front-office position at MGM, but turned it down because he wanted to be more actively involved in film production, which was followed by a denial from Fox that he was headed to that studio. One of the rumors which circulated was that Briskin was part of a group aligned with Consolidated Film Industries, which was attempting a takeover of Universal. By year's end, Briskin had agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with Warner Bros. to produce 12 films, however that deal never reached fruition and Briskin ended up agreeing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with RKO to join the studio as their vice-president in charge of production. The position was newly created especially for Briskin. B. B. Kahane remained as the overall head of RKO Studios, running all aspects other than production, but there was concern that Briskin would have conflict with long-term RKO producer, Pandro S. Berman. Conflict was averted when Berman received a one-year extension on his contract, wherein he had sole authority over his productions, answering only directly to Kahane.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2009, the Coalition's {{climate change}} {{spokesman}} Ian Macfarlane agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> {{with the government}} to amend the ETS legislation. The amendments provided industry with substantial compensation and exemptions from the ETS. Turnbull took the deal to Liberal MPs for formal approval, but a majority of backbenchers opposed it. Turnbull nonetheless claimed he had the Coalition's support, by counting as supporters the 20 members of the Coalition Shadow Cabinet who he argued should be presumed to support the deal. This claim was met with rancour by his opponents in the Coalition.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2006–07 season, Panthers general manager Mike Keenan traded Luongo to the Vancouver Canucks on June 23, 2006.

It was while filming Goldfinger that Connery also became a fan of golf.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} for DOS in 1995. In 1996, the game received a Windows 95 re-release titled Command & Conquer: Gold (also known as C 95), featuring SVGA visuals.

5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the three-episode Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the {{developers}} of the game, including programmers John Carmack and John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack, left their jobs at Softdisk to found id Software. After making a prototype game in Dreams to develop new ideas such as gameplay changes, graphical enhancements like parallax scrolling, and artistic improvements, the team worked on making a sequel trilogy of episodes from June to December 1991. During development the last episode was split off to be released as a stand-alone game due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> made by id's new president, Mark Rein, with the remaining two episodes produced as a pair titled Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy instead. Aliens, despite being released as the sixth main episode in the series, was developed before the fifth. It did not sell as well as the first trilogy, which was attributed by id to poor marketing and its awkward status as a stand-alone retail game in a series known for groups of shareware episodes. Although another Keen game was planned, during development id Software began work on Wolfenstein 3D, and its success, along with the development of Doom, led id to not develop any further Keen games.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E
5|$|Plans for an IndyCar Series race in Brazil were {{confirmed}} on 25 November 2009, with authorities in São Paulo and the Indy Racing League agreeing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> {{for the city}} to host the series. Race details for the São Paulo Indy 300 were announced on 25 January 2010. It was the first American open-wheel race in the country since the Rio 200 at Jacarepaguá in 2000. Despite a lengthy distance to travel from most team bases, the event promoters offered each team a six-figure sum of money, as well as paying for all expenses. A total of seven Brazilian drivers would compete in the race, including Ana Beatriz, Hélio Castroneves, Tony Kanaan, Raphael Matos, Vitor Meira, Mario Moraes and Mario Romancini. Of those seven, four drivers—Beatriz, Castroneves, Moraes and Romancini—are natives of São Paulo.

5|$|The port was {{released}} on September 17, 2009. It was later re-released as part of Sony's budget series release on August 2, 2012. Speaking in January 2010, Namco Bandai announced {{that they had no}} plans to release the port overseas. Later that year, Yuri's English voice actor Troy Baker said that he had been recording new English dialogue for the PS3 port. A report from a Namco Bandai employee sparked speculation that the reason behind the lack of a localization was due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with Microsoft to keep the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive in western territories. Later, she retracted this statement, apologizing for creating false impressions. Series producer Hideo Baba later said that the main factor in this decision was the strain put on the team with the simultaneous release of the original, meaning a Japan-exclusive release was chosen to lessen the burden. This also coincided with poor marketing feedback for the series in western territories.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, the Phillies named Rubén Amaro, Jr. to be {{the general}} manager after Pat Gillick retired {{at the end of}} a three-year contract.
