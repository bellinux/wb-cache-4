5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{indicating}} infection include {{movement of}} fluid in <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> during palpation (fluctuance), {{swollen lymph nodes}} in the neck, and fever with an oral temperature more than 37.7°C.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that of any of <b>the</b> <b>tissues,</b> {{there is a tendency}} for gas to return from <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{fixation}} {{is performed}} by chemical fixation using formalin. This prevents the postmortem degeneration of <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> and hardens soft <b>tissue.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tissue</b> is dehydrated using ethanol and the alcohol is cleared using an organic solvent such as xylene. <b>The</b> <b>tissue</b> {{is embedded in}} parafin which infiltrates the microscopic spaces present throughout <b>the</b> <b>tissue.</b> <b>The</b> embedded <b>tissue</b> is sliced using a microtome and subsequently stained to produce contrast needed to visualize <b>the</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cryoablation is a newer {{treatment}} for SVT involving the AV node directly. SVT involving the AV node {{is often a}} contraindication for using radiofrequency ablation due to the small (1%) incidence of injuring the AV node, requiring a permanent pacemaker. Cryoablation uses a catheter supercooled by nitrous oxide gas freezing <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> to −10 °C. This provides the same result as radiofrequency ablation but does not carry the same risk. If you freeze <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> and then realize {{you are in a}} dangerous spot, you can halt freezing <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> and allow <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> to spontaneously rewarm and <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> is <b>the</b> same as if you never touched it. If after freezing <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> to −10 °C you get the desired result, then you freeze <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> down to a temperature of −73 °C and you permanently ablate <b>the</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|R
40|$|To avoid damage as a {{consequence}} of a surgical procedure, it is important to define loading thresholds that can safely be applied to soft <b>tissues.</b> <b>The</b> goal of this research is to determine the mechanical properties of cardiovascular <b>tissue,</b> more specifically <b>the</b> sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> to damage. To be able to quantify this sensitivity to damage, an experimental setup was designed. This setup can stretch a piece of cardiovascular tissue stepwise.

5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> during decompression.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial damage}} is usually due to over-stretching <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> in tension or shear, either {{directly}} by {{expansion of the}} gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{interval}} (SI) or surface interval time (SIT) is {{the time}} spent by a diver at surface pressure after a dive during which inert gas which was still present {{at the end of}} the dive is further eliminated from <b>the</b> <b>tissues.</b> This continues until <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> are at equilibrium with the surface pressures. This may take several hours. In the case of the US Navy 1956 Air tables, it is considered complete after 12 hours, The US Navy 2008 Air tables specify up to 16 hours for normal exposure. but other algorithms may require more than 24 hours to assume full equilibrium.|$|E
30|$|In phase III, {{after the}} needle {{penetrated}} {{from the opposite}} side of the sample, the friction force increased slightly. This phenomenon was not observed in phase II, because the needle cut <b>the</b> thin <b>tissue</b> in <b>the</b> beginning of phase III. In cutting <b>the</b> thin <b>tissue,</b> <b>the</b> needle was deformed <b>the</b> <b>tissue.</b> After penetration of <b>the</b> <b>tissue,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> moved to <b>the</b> opposite direction of the needle.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tissue</b> damage depends {{primarily}} on the absorbed energy and <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> sensitivity; it {{is a function of}} the microwave power density (which depends on the distance from the source and its power output), frequency, absorption rate in <b>the</b> given <b>tissue,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> sensitivity. Tissues with high water (resp. electrolyte) content show higher microwave absorption.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{tissue is}} frozen while a {{polyethylene}} bag placed in abutting relationship against opposed {{walls of a}} pair of heaters. <b>The</b> bag and <b>tissue</b> are cooled with refrigerating gas at a time programmed rate at least equal to the maximum cooling rate needed {{at any time during the}} freezing process.

5|$|A {{saturation}} {{profile is}} one which all <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> {{considered by the}} decompression model have become saturated with inert gas from the breathing mixture. Most decompression models will take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered. Further bottom time at the same depth will not affect the inert gas loading of any tissue and will not affect the decompression required.|$|E

5|$|Albert A. Bühlmann {{published}} Decompression–Decompression sickness in 1984. Bühlmann {{recognized the}} problems associated with altitude diving, and proposed a method that calculated maximum nitrogen loading in <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> at a particular ambient pressure by modifying Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios to increase linearly with depth.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount specific to <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> compartment. When <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> pressure drops below this cross-over criterion <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, {{so it is}} always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|R
30|$|In phase I, {{the total}} {{insertion}} force increased non linearly until the needle penetrated <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> surface.

5000|$|A {{variation}} on the vibrating microtome is the Compresstome microtome, which is designed and made by Precisionary Instruments. The Compresstome uses a specimen syringe or [...] "lipstick-like" [...] tube to hold <b>the</b> <b>tissue.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tissue</b> specimen is completely embedded in agarose, and <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> is slowly and gently pressed out of the tube for the vibrating blade to cut.

The slight compression prevents shearing, uneven cutting, and vibration artifacts from forming. Note that the compression technology does not damage or affect <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> being sectioned.|$|R
5|$|All <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> are in Aristotle's view {{completely}} uniform {{parts with}} no internal structure of any kind; a cartilage for example {{was the same}} all the way through, not subdivided into atoms as Democritus (c. 460–c. 370 BC) had argued.

5|$|At higher pressures, skin {{tension of}} the bubble nuclei reduces gas {{diffusion}} to a slower rate. The model assumes that bubble skins are stabilized by surfactants over calculable times scales, which results in variable persistence of the bubble nuclei in <b>the</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|E

5|$|Decompression in {{the context}} of diving derives from the {{reduction}} in ambient pressure experienced by the diver during the ascent {{at the end of a}} dive or hyperbaric exposure and refers to both the reduction in pressure and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> during this reduction in pressure.|$|E
5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble formation in <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> {{could be avoided}} during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time.

5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> known as terpenoids.|$|E
