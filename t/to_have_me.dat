500|$|On 4 October 2006, it was {{announced}} that actress Nadine Lewington had been cast in the role of Maddy. Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how lucky he was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really sweet little story actually. Very touching".|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of X2, producer Lauren Shuler Donner had discussed {{the idea of a}} film focusing on the young X-Men with the crew, which was met with approval; the concept was revived during {{the production}} of [...] One of The Last Stands writers, Zak Penn, was hired to write and direct this spin-off, but this idea later fell through. Penn explained in 2007 that [...] "the original idea was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But someone came up with a pretty interesting idea [...] it was this guy who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on X3. He came up with how to do a young X-Men movie which is not what you'd expect." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from being}} Carey's second highest {{worldwide}} seller, Daydream served as her most personal and directly influenced album at the time. During the album's recording, Carey grew as an artist, {{as well as}} a writer. For {{the first time in her}} career, Carey was able to make music that she truly related to, R and hip hop. While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for [...] "Fantasy". They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carey openly spoke of her issues with Columbia: [...] "Everybody was like 'What, are you crazy?' They're nervous about breaking the formula. It works <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> sing a ballad on stage in a long dress with my hair up." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Music began in January 2000 at Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. The first song that Madonna and Ahmadzaï worked on was [...] "Impressive Instant", {{since it was}} the most complete among all the demos that he had sent to the singer. The song was an instrumental and was not supposed to be included in Ahmadzaï's own album, Production. But Madonna had different ideas for the track and its lyrics, which she explained to the producer. Feeling that Madonna's vision about the song's composition would be difficult to create in Sarm West, Ahmadzaï wanted to return to Paris and work there on his own computer. [...] "There are a lot of chopped vocal tracks on 'Impressive Instant'...That was impossible to do in the studio. It doesn't make sense to rent a place like Sarm just <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> work on ten seconds of music all day, using only the one computer," [...] he added. Within the first ten days, they had recorded the backing vocals, acoustic guitars etc. on a Sony 48-track and transferred it to Logic Audio workstation, using the converters of the TC Electronic Finalizer; Ahmadzaï then went back to Paris with the recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Kornheiser {{returned}} for a second season of Monday Night Football. On January 9, 2007, Kornheiser told Newsday, [...] "If they would like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> back, my inclination is that I {{would like to do}} it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{leaving out}} the {{condemnation}} of the [...] "killing of innocents" [...] entirely, Mohammed El Oifi writing in Le Monde diplomatique argued that this translation left the implication that civilians (the innocent) are considered a legitimate target. Several British newspapers subsequently used MEMRI's translation to run headlines such as [...] "Islamic radical has praised the suicide bomb attacks on the capital" [...] prompting al-Sebai to demand an apology and take legal action. In his view, MEMRI's translation was also [...] "an incitement <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> arrested by the British authorities".|$|E

6000|$|... "No, honestly, I don't think I was," [...] {{answered}} Staniford. [...] "But I {{seemed to}} leave that impression on the company. I felt a little nasty, that was all; and I tried to hurt Mr. Dunham's feelings. But I shall make it right with him before I sleep; he knows that. He's used <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>me</b> repent at leisure. Do you ever walk Sunday night?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Christmas Eve of 1886 was {{a turning}} point in the life of Thérèse; she called it her [...] "complete conversion." [...] Years later she stated that on that night she overcame the {{pressures}} she had faced since the death of her mother and said that [...] "God worked a little miracle to make me grow up in an instant ... On that blessed night … Jesus, who saw fit to make Himself a child out of love for me, saw fit <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> come forth from the swaddling clothes and imperfections of childhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{described}} himself as a [...] "radical atheist", adding [...] "radical" [...] for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it. He imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, [...] "This is an interesting world I find myself in – an interesting hole I find myself in – fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> in it!" [...] to demonstrate his view that the fine-tuned Universe argument for God was a fallacy.|$|E
2500|$|Radner battled bulimia {{while on}} the show. She had a {{relationship}} with SNL castmate Bill Murray, with whom she worked at the National Lampoon, and that ended badly. Few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In It's Always Something, this is the one reference Radner made to Murray in the entire book: [...] "All the guys [...] liked <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> around because I would laugh at them till I peed in my pants and tears rolled out of my eyes. We worked together {{for a couple of years}} creating The National Lampoon Show, writing The National Lampoon Radio Hour, and even working on stuff for the magazine. Bill Murray joined the show and Richard Belzer..." ...|$|E

2500|$|... {{imagine a}} puddle waking {{up one morning}} and thinking, 'This is an {{interesting}} world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.|$|E
2500|$|Helm {{recalled}} {{her experiences}} of shooting {{the film in}} a contemporary interview, saying that [...] "the night shots lasted three weeks, {{and even if they}} did lead to the greatest dramatic moments – even if we did follow Fritz Lang’s directions as though in a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time – I can’t forget the incredible strain that they put us under. The work wasn’t easy, and the authenticity in the portrayal ended up testing our nerves now and then. For instance, it wasn’t fun at all when Grot drags me by the hair, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> burned at the stake. Once I even fainted: during the transformation scene, Maria, as the android, is clamped in a kind of wooden armament, and because the shot took so long, I didn’t get enough air." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this first}} visit, Schieble told Jobs {{that he had}} a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother. Schieble then {{arranged}} for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that [...] "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy." [...] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk {{to get to know each}} other. Jobs later told his biographer that [...] "Mona was not completely thrilled at first <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me [...] [...] [...] [...] As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close." ...|$|E
60|$|Dr. John commented not. I {{supposed}} he regarded my silence as eccentric, {{but he was}} indulgent in refraining from censure. I daresay, too, he would have deemed it impertinent <b>to</b> <b>have</b> interrogated <b>me</b> very closely, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> asked <b>me</b> the why and wherefore of my reserve; and, though he might feel a little curious, {{the importance of the}} case was by no means such as to tempt curiosity to infringe on discretion.|$|R

2500|$|After Jobs' adoptive mother, Clara, died of {{lung cancer}} in 1986, he met with Schieble (whom he had already found through an {{extensive}} search) for the first time. He then discovered that not only was Simpson his sister but that she also had no idea an older brother had been given up for adoption. Schieble then arranged for Jobs and Simpson to meet in New York where Simpson worked. She states that her first impression of Jobs was that “he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy." [...] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk {{in order to get to}} know each other. Jobs later told his biographer that “Mona was not completely thrilled at first <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me...as we got to know each other, we became really good friends and she is my family.

2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> hear His first call!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Omori and {{his colleagues}} spent time in the city {{measuring}} damaged buildings and taking photographs. [...] They were reportedly assaulted {{on more than one}} occasion. At least two authors state that Omori and colleagues were attacked on Mission Street, San Francisco by a gang of men and youths who were later hailed by the local press for their anti-Japanese racist stoning and slugging of random Japanese men, however contemporary sources indicate that one boy involved in the stoning of Dr. Omori worked for the Post Office as a messenger was fired by Postmaster Fisk of San Francisco when the Japanese Association of America protested. Other incidents alleged {{in a letter to the}} newspaper are unreferenced by any other sources, and Omori himself chose to forgive writing, [...] "referring to some trouble I had with hoodlums in San Francisco. [...] I was very glad to see that the people of Hawaii did not like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> treated in that way, but then it did me no injury and I bear no malice. [...] There are hoodlums in all countries. [...] The people of California treated me extremely well and I am very much pleased with my trip." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though their}} group was {{traditionally}} {{viewed as a}} monolith, the members of Cioculescu's generation often aimed their critical remarks at each other. The debate between Călinescu and Cioculescu was therefore echoed in the former's History of Romanian Literature (first edition 1941), which spoke of Cioculescu as [...] "a major personality" [...] with [...] "an enormous capacity for literary pleasure", but reproached his [...] "fear of commitment" [...] and his [...] "slowness" [...] in entering cultural debates, {{as well as his}} interest in details. Ştefănescu writes that Cioculescu made a point of downplaying Călinescu's synthesis, [...] "with the manifest intent of finding cracks in the marble monument". Călinescu also viewed his colleague's tastes as problematic, particularly in matters of poetry assessment, and claimed that such pronouncements tended to fluctuate between [...] "the minimum and the maximum." [...] In his view, Cioculescu had failed to adequately understand the narrative power of works by Liviu Rebreanu (Răscoala) and Mihail Sadoveanu, and had preferred to state objections to minor aspects of their work—all while maintaining an exterior politeness which [...] "promises nothing good to the victim." [...] The book also featured references to clashes between Cioculescu and various other critics of the day, noting that the former's tone [...] "is very cold, but the patients are being led to the door with ceremony". Commenting with irony on his entry in the same volume, Cioculescu himself stated, years after his rival's death: [...] "I would be an ingrate not to thank the shadow of G. Călinescu for having publicly spared me, it being more suited to him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> destroyed 'in confidence'." ...|$|E
