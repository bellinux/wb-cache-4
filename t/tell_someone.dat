According to the source, around $93 million was raised. She spoke out in relation to the cause, saying: [...] "Finding the courage to <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> about being abused {{is one of the most}} difficult decisions a child will ever have to make." [...] In 2010 and 2012, she was involved in supporting the AIDS Support Gala, which was held by the American Foundation for Aids Research (Amfar).|$|E

Harris tells the children not to be afraid to <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> {{if they have been}} improperly touched, saying, [...] "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help. You can't protect them from trouble that they themselves have caused, and it's better to say something so that you and the family can get the help you need. You know nothing gets better by keeping quiet about it." [...] Harris says that, if it is difficult to explain where they have been touched, they can draw a picture or point to the place on a doll. The film ends with [...] "My Body" [...] sung by a group of people including Harris, two police officers, and some children.|$|E

TV Week described Chris as being [...] "deeply conflicted" [...] over his decision to tell her about his sexuality. Mason said [...] "It's hard for Chris because he has a girlfriend who he's been with for some time. To try and <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> in this situation would be really difficult". Summer initially takes the news well and plays it down, but when fellow student Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) discovers that one of her classmates is gay, she goes out of her way to find out who it is and expose them. Mason said that she does not realise that [...] "what she sees as a game is someone else's life".|$|E

Ansari said he had been trying to work a {{reference}} to Foxx into the show for months. Tom's observation that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex was a joke previously used in the episode [...] "Ron and Tammy". The original joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] included a reference to the previous episode [...] "Galentine's Day", in which Andy discussed a song he wrote called [...] "Sex Hair", about how one could <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> had sex based on how matted their hair is. In the season finale, Andy rewrites the song to be called [...] "Pickle Hair" [...] so it can be played at the kid-friendly concert.|$|E
500|$|Forman and {{his colleagues}} were {{committed}} to the strategy of casting non-professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible. Most of the actors were chosen from among relatives, friends and acquaintances of Forman and his crew, {{to the point where}} Forman was later to liken the atmosphere to making a [...] "home movie". For the title role, Forman selected his 18-year-old ex-sister-in-law, Hana Brejchová, not because, as was rumored at the time, he wanted revenge on his ex-wife, movie-star Jana Brejchová, but because he had known Hana a long time, trusted her, and had great respect for her natural talents: [...] "She had an amazing ability of free expression, but with the risk that she didn’t recognize the extent. However, Vlada Pucholt [...] held her firmly in the rhythm of the scene, in a professional position.” The character of Milda's father was played by the uncle of Forman's cameraman, and Milda's mother was played by a factory lathe operator whom Passer and Papoušek had met on a streetcar, and who struck them as someone who [...] "seemed so interested in things around her, no matter how silly". The factory supervisor was played by the actual public relations manager of the factory at Zruč nad Sázavou, where location shooting took place. For the main trio of reservists, Forman wanted to use non-professionals, including the writer Josef Škvorecký, but found that, while the three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs, they lost their rhythm when all three were included in the same shot. So Forman went to Škvorecký and told the writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with the professional actor Vladimir Mensik. [...] In Škvorecký's words: [...] "To <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very nice way of letting him know that he should stay with screen-play writing. [...] Milos is a very considerate person. The fact that he so gently threw me out made possible the greatest scene of Loves of a Blonde". Forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional: [...] "While nonactors keep the actors honest and real, the actors give the scene the rhythm and shape that the nonactors don't feel. A nonactor inhabits the situation so completely that he or she isn't able to view it from the outside, to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose. Nonactors are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on, so an actor can pull them through the dramatic arch of the scene and draw out the emotional contours of the situation." ...|$|E

Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide {{the health care}} choices that women are making.... suggested that in fact employers {{should be able to}} make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don't believe employers should <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong." ...|$|E

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between lying, belief, and knowledge? Prominent accounts of lying define it in terms of belief, namely <b>telling</b> <b>someone</b> something one believes to be false, often with the intent to deceive. This paper develops a novel account of lying by deriving evaluative dimensions of responsibility from the knowledge norm of assertion. Lies are best understood as special cases of vicious assertion; lying is the anti-paradigm of proper assertion. This enables an account of lying in terms of knowledge: roughly, lying is <b>telling</b> <b>someone</b> something you know ain't so...|$|R

2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a couple {{different}} types of irony in the sonnets in general that which is [...] "openly voiced by the speaker and authorial irony suggested {{at the expense of the}} (deceived) speaker." [...] There seems to a sense of irony when the speaker tells the beloved to forget him. Schoenfeldt reasons that [...] "we cannot quite take these lines literally" [...] because [...] "to <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> to forget something is to make it harder for them to forget." [...] This demonstrates a certain [...] "reverse-psychology appeal" [...] as a sense of irony. Furthermore [...] "the shift from the 'vile world' (line 4) to the 'wise world' (line 13) is the final evidence of Shakespeare's irony" [...] in this particular sonnet. Krieger goes on to explain: [...] "For this world is wise—that is, shrewd, prudential—only as it is vile, only as it exercises those characteristics which ape the destructive perfection, the absolute cooperation with time, of the 'vilest worms.'" [...] He questions, [...] "How single-mindedly, then, is his friend to take this selfless, seemingly anti-sentimental injunction to obey to obey the dictates of the world's cold wisdom lest he be mocked by it?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After the United States {{abolished}} slavery, Garrison {{announced in}} May 1865 {{that he would}} resign {{the presidency of the}} American Anti-Slavery Society and offered a resolution declaring victory in the struggle against slavery and dissolving the society. The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend Wendell Phillips, who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118–48. Declaring that his [...] "vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended," [...] Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to Boston, he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of The Liberator at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granted voting rights to black men. (According to Henry Mayer, Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; [...] "as the cycle came around, always managed to <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> {{that he was not going}} to the next set of [...] meetings" [...]) ...|$|E
2500|$|Taste can be {{objective}} {{in terms of}} the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) {{but it can also be}} subjective in terms of what we deem [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad." [...] Taste is [...] "subjective, objective, and qualitative". In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. [...] "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)". We cannot <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> they do not think something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement ...|$|E
