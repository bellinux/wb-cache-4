5|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon is the 1974 second studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. The group was {{dissatisfied}} with the recording of their 1973 self-titled debut album, leading the band's frontman David Johansen to enlist veteran producer Shadow Morton for <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon. Morton had become disenchanted by the music industry, but felt motivated by the band's energy and agreed {{to work with them}} as a challenge. They recorded the album the following year at A Studios in New York City.|$|E
5|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon was {{released}} by Mercury Records on May 10, 1974, to poor sales and only charted at number 167 on the Billboard 200. After a problem-ridden national tour, the New York Dolls were dropped by Mercury and disbanded a few years later. The album received positive reviews from most critics, some of whom felt Morton's production highlighted the group's raw sound {{and made it a}} better record than their first. Like their debut album, <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon {{became one of the most}} popular cult records in rock music and has since been viewed by music journalists as a precursor to punk rock.|$|E

5|$|When <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon was {{released}} in Europe in July, the New York Dolls performed at the Buxton Festival in Derbyshire and the Rock Prom Festival at Olympia in London. They also embarked on their second tour of the United States, which lasted only a few months. It was marred by cancelled shows and conflicts between the band members stemming from their escalating addictions to alcohol and other drugs. Because of their alcoholism, they failed {{to set up a}} recording session for a scheduled third album after the tour had ended, and by 1975, they were dropped by Mercury before disbanding a few years later.|$|E

There may be no empirical evidence for the proposition that religion has a deterrent effect on crime, although sociologists and criminologists have long recognized potential links between religious belief and delinquent behaviour...|$|R

25|$|The New York Dolls {{were signed}} to Mercury Records, {{with the help}} of A & R man Paul Nelson. Thunders {{recorded}} two albums with the band, New York Dolls and <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon. They were managed by Marty Thau, and booked by Leber & Krebs. Subsequently they worked with Malcolm McLaren for several months, later becoming a prototype for the Sex Pistols.|$|E
25|$|Flynn's {{performance}} in the latter was well received {{and led to a}} series of roles where he played drunks. Warner Bros cast him as John Barrymore in <b>Too</b> <b>Much,</b> <b>Too</b> Soon (1958), and Zanuck used him again in The Roots of Heaven which made $3.0 million (1958). He met with Stanley Kubrick to discuss a role in Lolita, but nothing came of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory at}} Amiens was celebrated {{as a huge}} victory; {{not only did it}} mark a {{definitive}} turn in the road to Franco-Spanish peace but Spain had to sacrifice the war against France. In conjunction with Spanish financial distress, her insolvency caused by her bankrupt nature after the Capture of Cadiz, two costly failed armadas (in 1596 and 1597) against England and the war against the Dutch meant that Spain had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> deal with. Mutinies in the garrisons of Doulens, Cambrai, Ardres and Le Catalet added to Spain's problems. With this advantage Henry made sure the Peace of Vervins was signed which would end the war between Spain and France. The treaty was highly beneficial to France - an ill and dying Philip recognized the formerly Protestant Henry as King of France. In addition Spanish ruled towns were handed over to the French king under terms of the peace. Vervins was the final defeat of Philip II, and a sign of the long downfall of Habsburg Spain and the gradual rise in European hegemony of France during the ensuing Grand Siècle.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly I {{became aware}} of the strong fumes of tobacco. Turning my head, I saw a pale blue smoke curling up from behind an {{adjacent}} boulder. Rising, and climbing over the intermediate granite, I came upon a little hollow, in which, comfortably extended on the mosses and lichens, lay a powerfully-built man. He was very ragged; he was very dirty; there was a strong suggestion about him of his having <b>too</b> <b>much</b> hair, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> nail, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> perspiration; <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of those superfluous excrescences and exudations that society and civilization strive to keep under. But it was noticeable that he had not much of anything else. It was The Tramp.|$|R
25|$|Since its discovery, vitamin C {{has been}} {{considered}} almost a panacea by some, although this led to suspicions of it being overhyped by others. Vitamin C has been promoted in alternative medicine {{as a treatment for}} the common cold, cancer, polio and various other illnesses. The evidence for these claims is mixed. Orthomolecular-based megadose recommendations for vitamin C are based mainly on theoretical speculation and observational studies, such as those published by Fred R. Klenner from the 1940s through the 1970s. There is a strong advocacy movement for such doses of vitamin C, and there is an absence of large scale, formal trials in the 10 to 200+ grams per day range. The single repeatable side effect of oral megadose vitamin C is a mild laxative effect if the practitioner attempts to consume <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> quickly. A tolerable upper limit (UL) of vitamin C was set at 2grams {{for the first time in}} the year 2000, referencing this mild laxative effect as the reason for establishing the UL.|$|E
25|$|The {{second test}} of the series was played at Headingley. England omitted the {{struggling}} Paul Collingwood from the side, and replaced him with Andrew Flintoff, returning to play his first test since the final Ashes test at the SCG {{at the start of}} 2007. Ryan Sidebottom, suffering from injury, was replaced with debutant Darren Pattinson. This decision provoked considerable reaction as many felt there were other bowlers who were better placed to come into the side – Chris Tremlett, Matthew Hoggard and Stephen Harmison all sprung to mind. Pattinson, born in Grimsby and raised in Australia, had only bowled a handful of overs at first class level, and whilst he had shown promise, his elevation to the test arena was arguably <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> soon for him. A year previously, he was playing grade cricket in Australia alongside his regular job as a roof tiler. He had even shown uncertainly when asked about how keen he was to actually play for England. The decision to field him during a critical Test match prompted a variety of reaction and viewpoints from commentators, players and press experts.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon was remastered and reissued by Hip-O Select and Mercury, {{after which}} Christgau wrote in Blender that both it and New York Dolls make up [...] "a priceless proto-punk legacy". He wrote that {{although}} Johansen's best original songs {{are on the}} first record, <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon has consistent hooks, clever lyrics, and exceptional cover songs, including [...] "two R novelties whose theatrical potential was barely noticed until the Dolls penetrated their holy essence". That same year, rock journalist Toby Creswell named [...] "Babylon" [...] {{as one of the}} greatest songs of all time in his book 1001 Songs. In the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), Colin Larkin felt the band's issues with alcohol and other drugs affected their performance on the record, which he deemed [...] "a charismatic collection of punk/glam-rock anthems, typically delivered with 'wasted' cool".|$|E

She refused to make <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon, so Warner Bros. put her on suspension, which prevented her from starring in The Brothers Karamazov (1958) at MGM. Baker was also chosen by MGM for the lead in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and by Twentieth Century Fox for The Three Faces of Eve (1957), but her contract with Warner Bros. again prevented her from accepting the roles. Tensions between Baker and the studio escalated further when she went against their wishes by appearing in Arms and the Man on stage. Baker commented {{on the effect of}} the system on her career, saying: [...] "I came in {{at the end of the}} big studio system. I still had a slave contract and they were willing to put you in almost anything they had." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{a review of}} the album for Rolling Stone, Dave Marsh hailed the New York Dolls as the leading hard rock band in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's competent drumming, Johansen's ability to add depth to his characters, and Thunders's innovative guitar playing. Marsh especially praised his playing on [...] "Chatterbox", calling it [...] "a classic", and believed even the most brazen songs sounded successful because Morton's production highlighted the group's more unrefined musical qualities. Writing for Creem magazine, Christgau said the polished sound reproduction preserved the band's raw qualities, {{especially in the case of}} Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and remarked that Rundgren [...] "should be ashamed—Shadow Morton has gotten more out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any but their best nights." [...] Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times felt <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon was a better-produced album that proved the band to be [...] "the real thing", calling it the best record of derisive punk rock since Exile on Main St. by the Rolling Stones in 1972. In The New Yorker, Ellen Willis wrote that she learned to appreciate <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon more than New York Dolls after seeing the band perform songs from the former album in concert, particularly [...] "Human Being" [...] and [...] "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from Phonograph Record magazine said the group's [...] "easy going ironic sensibility" [...] was expressed [...] "far more amusingly and accessibly" [...] here than on their debut album.|$|E

500|$|Along with New York Dolls, <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon {{became one}} of the most popular cult albums in rock music. According to AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the group predated punk rock with their [...] "gleeful sleaziness and {{reckless}} sound" [...] on the record, which he said was embellished by Morton's production details and exemplified by [...] "musically visceral and dangerous" [...] songs such as [...] "Human Being". In 1986, Sounds magazine ranked it sixtieth on its list of the 100 best albums of all time. After it was reissued by Mercury in 1987, Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Morton's production highlighted the New York Dolls' sense of humor and was rendered vividly by the CD remaster. However, he felt <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Soon was marred by inconsistent material and rated it lower than their first record. In a review of the reissue, Don Waller of the Los Angeles Times said the album was underappreciated and as much an [...] "instant classic" [...] as New York Dolls.|$|E
