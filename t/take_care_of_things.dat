25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albee’s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} balance that has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnes’s mind, that can easily be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if she were to lose her sense of the rational. Who would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things?</b> The way in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, is to lose contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E
500|$|Johnson, alive but injured, is {{spying on}} his own home, {{watching}} Briggs visit Shelly. Shelly is terrified that Johnson will return and kill her; but Briggs reassures her he will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Johnson is also listening to a police radio in his truck, and hears that Renault's myna bird is being considered a witness as its ability to mimic speech might provide a clue; he drives off immediately. That night, he shoots the bird dead through the sheriff station's window. However, a voice-activated tape recorder had been left by the bird's cage; Cooper is {{able to find the}} words [...] "Leo, no!" [...] among the phrases it had repeated that evening.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, they {{discover}} {{the identity of}} one of the dead robbers, Blake, and learn of his abandoned apartment. Fauxlivia goes to the apartment alone without alerting Peter, but Peter soon joins her. The two find that Blake had a roommate, likely the third man, but he is nowhere to be seen. That night, while at Olivia's apartment, Fauxlivia studies Olivia's case files, and comments of her prime counterpart, [...] "You have a photographic memory. How am I gonna do that?" [...] indicating that she does not possess this ability. A moment later she is visited by the third man, Joe (Russell Harvard), who had seen Fauxlivia at Blake's apartment and, believing her to be a cop, brought the item stolen from the Milton home - a small box. Fauxlivia finds Joe is deaf, and thus was unaffected by the ultrasonics of the box. Fauxlivia contacts Newton, who collects the box [...] having originally hired the men to collect it for him [...] and offers to kill the deaf man. Fauxlivia tells him she will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> herself and shoots the deaf man. While hiding the body, Peter arrives to talk to her. To distract him and prevent him from noticing a pool of blood seeping under the bathroom door, Fauxlivia engages in romantic actions with Peter.|$|E

[...] Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.|$|R
5000|$|The Punjabi Cultural Heritage Board raised {{disagreements}} due to some objection regarding certain {{scenes and}} dialogues. The producer and lead actor Ajay Devgn understood the objections and edited the scenes. [...] "The creativity {{of the film}} has not been affected in any way.

The writer {{and director of the}} film is Punjabi and we <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Even the guy who tied my turban was from Punjab", he added.|$|R

60|$|Now it happened, as it {{generally}} does to persons who <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> {{that the article}} which Jonas thus preserved, came into use exactly.

6000|$|... "Now get aboard, four of you," [...] I {{said in a}} loud voice, {{indicating}} with {{my fingers}} that four of them were {{to go with me}} and the fifth was to remain by the junk. The Yellow Handkerchief hesitated; but I repeated the order fiercely (much more fiercely than I felt), at the same time sending my hand to my hip. Again the Yellow Handkerchief was overawed, and with surly looks he led three of his men aboard the Reindeer. I cast off at once, and, leaving the jib down, steered a course for George's junk. Here it was easier, for there were two of us, and George had a pistol to fall back on if it came to the worst. And here, as with my junk, four Chinese were transferred to the sloop and one left behind to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the post-print {{world of}} the not very distant future, Anana had been enjoying {{her job at the}} NADEL, a {{scholarly}} foundation-funded project, even though she was not much of a reader, herself. Like most people, she got all the news and narrative she wanted on her [...] "Meme," [...] an artificially intelligent as well as smart phone/digital assistant. She shrugged off her father's aversion to the device, because she liked hers. It had learned her preferences and mapped her life so intimately that it automatically <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> for her, from ordering menu items or driverless car rides to downloading a definition from the Word Exchange for a word she had momentarily forgotten.|$|R
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> {{in the cosmos}} or that he does not, and, if he does <b>take</b> <b>care,</b> that it is either <b>of</b> all <b>things</b> or <b>of</b> some. Now if he <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything, {{there would be no}} {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. On the other hand, if he <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> only some <b>things,</b> why does he <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> <b>of</b> which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> in the cosmos.|$|R

50|$|The Residents {{had begun}} {{a movie in}} 1972 called Vileness Fats. The concept of the movie was to shoot it on a new media form (reel-to-reel video) and tell most of the story through music.

Unbeknownst to the population, {{the leader of the}} bandits is their own spiritual leader. To <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> the village hires Siamese twin tag-team wrestlers to be their saviors.

With the threat of US intervention looming unless the government controls the situation, the team uses an old stretch of the Ginza Line to approach an artificial island Tsuge uses as his hideout. Goto also <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> on his end by facilitating the arrest of Shigeki Arakawa, a GSDF intelligence agent who is actually one of Tsuge's cohorts.
