40|$|In {{this paper}} we proceed to {{estimate}} {{a measure of}} the flow-through capability of the firms listed in the Spanish Stock Exchange. The flow-through capability is defined as the ability of firms to transmit inflation shocks to the prices of the products and services sold by the company. According to a strand of literature, this flow-through capability can explain, to some extent, the so called “stock duration paradox”, that is the difference between the <b>theoretical</b> <b>stock</b> duration derived from the DDM model and its empirical estimates. The line of reasoning suggest that if a company can pass on inflation shocks to the prices of its own outputs and then to profits and dividends, nominal interest rate changes due to variations in the expected inflation will have a limited impact on stock prices. So in this paper we first estimate the flow-trough capability for different industries finding strong differences among them. Then, we analyse the link between flow-through capability and stock duration finding a significant negative relationship between them as claimed by part of the literature...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to our knowledge}} of the behaviour of the Chinese stock market by offering an empirical investigation into issues such as market segmentation, inter‐relationships between Chinese stock markets and inter‐relationships with foreign stock markets. Basic questions which have been typically analysed for developed stock markets are considered in this thesis. These include an analysis of core concepts such as volatility; causal links with economic variables and the reasons why the <b>theoretical</b> <b>stock</b> price may be different from the actual stock price. Methodological methods include; cointegration, generalised autoregressive heteroscedastic modelling (GARCH), vector autoregressive framework modelling (VAR) and panel data analysis. Both daily and monthly observations are used over a time period from 1996 to 2006. The results indicate that there is a rich set of reasons why we may observe phenomena such as a discount on B shares and a relationship between A shares and B shares. The findings also suggest that China is not isolated {{from the rest of the}} world and that there is evidence of inter‐relationships with foreign stock markets and that Chinese stock market prices are close to their fundamental value. This is not generally the finding for developed stock markets. Overall, it appears that the methodological approaches usually associated with developed stock markets can serve us well as useful tools in creating a deeper understanding of the underlying fundamentals describing the Chinese stock market.

40|$|Ohlson (1991) and Feltham and Ohlson (1993) provide two {{different}} but equivalent formulations of stock price. First, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>stock</b> price equals book value adjusted {{for the present}} value of future expected abnormal earnings. Second, the stock price is a function of book value, abnormal earnings, and operating assets. Based on these models, this study examines the differences in the quality of accounting numbers in six countries: the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Canada, France, and Germany. ^ According to the first model, current price-to-book (PB) ratio predicts future return-on-equity (ROE) better than current ROE does. Only the French sample weakly supports the hypothesis. The samples for the US, Canada, and Germany exhibit the dominance of ROE over PB in predicting future ROEs. ^ The second model predicts that goodwill is an increasing function of the persistence of abnormal earnings and the degree of understatement of operating assets. The US and UK samples support the hypotheses. The Japanese, German, and French samples do not support the hypotheses. ^ This study also provides the ranking of the quality of accounting numbers among the six countries in three dimensions of earnings quality: (i) the degree of accounting conservatism, (ii) persistence of earnings, and (iii) the strength of the relationship between unrecorded goodwill and abnormal earnings. An overall rank for each country is provided based on the rank scores in each earnings quality dimension. The UK ranks the highest in each dimension of earnings quality and in overall ranking. ^ This study contributes to the financial statement analysis literature in two ways. First, {{the results of this study}} provide insights into the empirical validity of the accounting valuation model proposed by Ohlson (1991) and Feltham and Ohlson (1993). Second, the results show that there are substantial differences in the quality of accounting numbers in different countries. One limitation of this study is that it assumes the quality of accounting numbers for firms in each country to be the same. ...|$|E

The approach consists of augmenting the long-run model with general short-run dynamic specifications and identifying the specific assumptions implied by each of these estimators about the short-run dynamics. Understanding this hierarchical structure between estimators is important since it shows the conditions when consistent and asymptotically efficient parameter estimates may be obtained from standard econometric packages. Since the alternative estimators are shown to be nested in a general framework, this suggests that general-to-specific methodology may be adopted to test between these alternative specifications. To highlight the salient characteristics of the alternative estimators, the framework is related to two <b>theoretical</b> economic models: <b>stock</b> prices and money demand; and applied to the demand for imports and testing of the crowding out hypothesis.

40|$|We present {{univariate}} {{and multivariate}} {{evidence to show}} that firms which engage in initial stock repurchases have some specific economic and financial attributes when compared to size-and industry-matched firms. We find that initial repurchase firms are younger, have lower leverage and operating risk, and higher payouts, operating cash flows, profitability and market-to-book than matched non-repurchase firms. Compared to secondary or “seasoned” repurchase matched firms, these initial repurchase firms are also younger and have higher cash, profitability, sales growth and market-to-book, as well as lower payouts, leverage and retained earnings. Therefore, we analyze the determinants and motivations that may explain why firms repurchase their own stock for the first time by studying the theoretical hypotheses found in the financial literature that are most important in explaining initial stock repurchases. The results support the free cash flow and risk reduction signaling hypotheses and the flexibility motivation for conducting stock repurchases.

40|$|International audienceMany {{projections}} of the soil carbon sink or source are based on kinetically defined carbon pool models. Parameters of these models are often determined {{in a way that}} the steady state of the model matches observed carbon stocks. The underlying simplifying assumption is that observed carbon stocks are near equilibrium. This assumption is challenged by observations of very old soils that do still accumulate carbon. In this modelling study we explored the consequences of the case where soils are apart from equilibrium. Calculation of equilibrium states of soils that are currently accumulating small amounts of carbon were performed using the Yasso model. It was found that already very small current accumulation rates cause big changes in <b>theoretical</b> equilibrium <b>stocks,</b> which can virtually approach infinity. We conclude that soils that have been disturbed several centuries ago are not in equilibrium but in a transient state because of the slowly ongoing accumulation of the slowest pool. A first consequence is that model calibrations to current carbon stocks that assume equilibrium state, overestimate the decay rate of the slowest pool. A second consequence is that spin-up runs (simulations until equilibrium) overestimate stocks of recently disturbed sites. In order to account for these consequences, we propose a transient correction. This correction prescribes a lower decay rate of the slowest pool and accounts for disturbances in the past by decreasing the spin-up-run predicted stocks to match an independent estimate of current soil carbon stocks. Application of this transient correction at a Central European beech forest site with a typical disturbance history resulted in an additional carbon fixation of 5. 7 ± 1. 5 tC/ha within 100 years. Carbon storage capacity of disturbed forest soils is potentially much higher than currently assumed. Simulations that do not adequately account for the transient state of soil carbon stocks neglect a considerable amount of current carbon accumulation...|$|R
