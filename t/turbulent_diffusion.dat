40|$|<b>Turbulent</b> thermal <b>diffusion</b> is a {{combined}} {{effect of the}} temperature stratified turbulence and inertia of small particles. It causes {{the appearance of a}} non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles {{in the direction of the}} turbulent heat flux. This non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles is proportional to the product of the mean particle number density and the effective velocity of inertial particles. The theory of this effect has been previously developed only for small temperature gradients and small Stokes numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 224, 1996). In this study a generalized theory of <b>turbulent</b> thermal <b>diffusion</b> for arbitrary temperature gradients and Stokes numbers has been developed. The laboratory experiments in the oscillating grid turbulence and in the multi-fan produced turbulence have been performed to validate the theory of <b>turbulent</b> thermal <b>diffusion</b> in strongly stratified turbulent flows. It has been shown that the ratio of the effective velocity of inertial particles to the characteristic vertical turbulent velocity for large Reynolds numbers is less than 1. The effective velocity of inertial particles as well as the effective coefficient of <b>turbulent</b> thermal <b>diffusion</b> increase with Stokes numbers reaching the maximum at small Stokes numbers and decreases for larger Stokes numbers. The effective coefficient of <b>turbulent</b> thermal <b>diffusion</b> also decreases with the mean temperature gradient.

This <b>turbulent</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient is defined in a phenomenological sense, by analogy with the molecular diffusivities, {{but it does not}} have a true physical meaning, being dependent on the flow conditions, and not a property of the fluid itself. In addition, the turbulent diffusivity concept assumes a constitutive relation between a turbulent flux and the gradient of a mean variable similar to the relation between flux and gradient that exists for molecular transport. In the best case, this assumption is only an approximation. Nevertheless, the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows, and many models have been postulated to calculate it. For instance, in large bodies of water like oceans this coefficient can be found using Richardson's four-third power law and is governed by the random walk principle. In rivers and large ocean currents, the diffusion coefficient is given by variations of Elder's formula.|$|E

40|$|We {{determine}} the nonlinear drift velocities {{of the mean}} magnetic field and nonlinear <b>turbulent</b> magnetic <b>diffusion</b> in a <b>turbulent</b> convection. We show that the nonlinear drift velocities are caused by the three kinds of the inhomogeneities, i. e., inhomogeneous turbulence; the nonuniform fluid density and the nonuniform turbulent heat flux. The inhomogeneous turbulence results in the well-known turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities. The nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field cause the small-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in the turbulent convection. These phenomena {{are different from the}} large-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects which are due to the effect of the mean magnetic field on the large-scale density stratified fluid flow. The small-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping can be stronger than these large-scale effects when the mean magnetic field is smaller than the equipartition field. We discuss the small-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects {{in the context of the}} solar and stellar turbulent convection. We demonstrate also that the nonlinear <b>turbulent</b> magnetic <b>diffusion</b> in the <b>turbulent</b> convection is anisotropic even for a weak mean magnetic field.

50|$|Diffusion flames can be laminar {{diffusion}} flames (e.g. Candles and matches {{burning in}} the air etc.) and <b>turbulent</b> <b>diffusion</b> flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending {{on the nature of}} mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the discharging velocity of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow {{plays an important role in}} deciding the flame shapes. With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become <b>turbulent</b> <b>diffusion</b> flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as “break-up point”. Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change.
