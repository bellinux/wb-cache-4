5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{was highly}} praised; reviewers noted {{it as one}} of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions and the beauty of Emi Evans' vocal work. The first arranged album, while also warmly received, was perceived by critics to be weaker than the original and not long enough <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expectations created by the success of the original. The first three albums sold well enough to be recorded on the Japanese Oricon music charts, reaching number 24 for the original soundtrack, 59 for the first arranged album, and position number 77 for the second.|$|E

25|$|He {{began his}} crusade against the Mafia by {{claiming}} that government officials were receiving help in their elections from Cosa Nostra. Rather than making his accusations only in Sicily, he traveled to Rome to participate before the Antimafia Commission, which was established in 1963, to ensure that his worries about the Mafia in Sicily were heard. His willingness <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mafia in his quest to improve the living conditions of Sicilians helped him to gain {{the confidence of the}} locals.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E

25|$|As the Athenians advanced, they {{extended}} their left flank out to sea, outflanking the Spartans. The superior Athenian numbers, {{combined with the}} tactics they had implemented, created a dangerous situation for the Spartans, and Callicratidas' helmsman advised him to retire without a fight, but the navarch insisted on pushing on. Dividing his force in two to meet the threat of encirclement, Callicratidas led his fleet into battle. Heated fighting ensued for some time, but eventually Callicratidas, leading the Spartan right, was killed when his ship rammed an opposing ship, and resistance on the right collapsed. The left continued to resist for longer, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire Athenian fleet and soon joined the right wing in flight. All told, the Spartans lost some 70 ships, and the Athenians 25.|$|E
25|$|Family, or lack thereof, remains {{important}} throughout both Hilde's {{childhood and}} adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This {{is represented by}} her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework. In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state. In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable than her own family unit. This is evident at {{the climax of the}} novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing to do what was right by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals she was aware of were state-taught.|$|E
25|$|After the {{assassination}} of Caligula in 41, Agrippa {{was involved in the}} struggle over the accession between Claudius, the Praetorian Guard, and the Senate. How big a part Agrippa played is uncertain; the various sources differ. Cassius Dio simply writes that Agrippa cooperated with Claudius in seeking rule. Flavius Josephus gives us two versions. In The Jewish War, Agrippa is presented as only a messenger to a confident and energetic Claudius. But in The Antiquities of the Jews, Agrippa's role is central and crucial: he convinces Claudius <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate and the Senate to avoid attacking Claudius. After becoming Emperor, Claudius gave Agrippa dominion over Judea and Samaria and granted him the ornamenta consularia, and at his request gave the kingdom of Chalcis in Lebanon to Agrippa's brother Herod of Chalcis. Thus Agrippa {{became one of the most}} powerful kings of the east. His domain more or less equaled that which was held by his grandfather Herod the Great.|$|E

25|$|Rev. Duncan Magee (Derek McGrath)– The {{priest of}} the Anglican Church which also houses the mosque, he {{is a good}} friend to Amaar and the two clerics often turn to each other for advice. He is liberal, once {{offering}} to perform a gay marriage at the church, and is willing <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church hierarchy when he believes that it is acting inconsistently with the true message of Christianity. He often laments the sad state of his own church and congregation. His character unfortunately departs the show after season three, to be replaced by the ambitious, younger and distinctly less accommodating Rev. William Thorne. In seasons 1-3, it is gradually revealed that he has a number of hobbies (including curling, running and painting), all taken very seriously. His presence on the show illustrates the commonalities between Islamic and Anglican faiths and the similar problems the priests of each faith must face.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare satirizes the {{hyperbole}} of the allusions used {{by conventional}} poets, which {{even by the}} Elizabethan era, had become cliché, predictable, and uninspiring. This sonnet compares the poet's mistress {{to a number of}} natural beauties; each time making a point of his mistress' obvious inadequacy in such comparisons; she cannot hope <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beauties of the natural world. The first two quatrains compare the speaker's mistress to aspects of nature, such as snow or coral; each comparison ending unflatteringly for the mistress. In the final couplet, the speaker proclaims his love for his mistress by declaring that he makes no false comparisons, the implication being that other poets do precisely that. Shakespeare's sonnet aims to do the opposite, by indicating that his mistress is the ideal object of his affections because of her genuine qualities, and that she is more worthy of his love than the paramours of other poets who are more fanciful.|$|E
25|$|Foster, who {{is known}} by the Essex fans as Fozzy, is often {{regarded}} as the best wicket keeper in the game. In July 2011 Alec Stewart described him as the best pure wicket-keeper in the world. This {{is a fact that}} is underlined by his ability <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps to many quick bowlers with consistency and excellence, and for his athleticism standing back. However, he has been overlooked by England selectors as a possible result of perceived mediocre batting, with Matt Prior, Steven Davies and Jos Buttler being preferred. Foster's batting is reliant on cuts, pulls and sweeps. In all forms of cricket, Foster uses the reverse sweep effectively. Foster usually bats at seven for Essex in all forms. He once hit 5 sixes off of the first five balls of a Scott Borthwick over vs Durham in a Pro40, but missed out on the elusive sixth when Borthwick bowled a leg-side wide.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Sting was the first <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Outsiders: Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, who had {{recently}} competed in the WWF and whose alliances and agenda were unclear, had been infiltrating and causing chaos at WCW events. Sting teamed with Luger and Savage to defend WCW against Hall, Nash, and a mysterious third Outsider to be revealed at the Bash at the Beach. Hall and Nash started the bout without their third partner, but the WCW's temporary three-on-two advantage was short-lived: Luger left the match after he was accidentally injured by a mistimed Stinger Splash. The two-on-two match continued while Hogan, {{who had been a}} fan favorite for over two decades, emerged at ringside. Hogan appeared ready to back up the WCW wrestlers until he attacked Savage with his leg drop finisher in one of wrestling's most famous swerves. The match was ruled a no-contest, and Hall, Nash, and Hogan declared a new world order in professional wrestling. The name stuck and Sting became one of WCW's stalwarts against the New World Order, or nWo for short.|$|E
25|$|In Santafé de Bogotá, {{capital of}} the Viceroyalty, word arrived of the events in Cartagena, and of {{the arrival of the}} Regency Commissioner Villavicencio in that city. The people of Santafé had been waiting anxiously for his arrival, as they hoped it would further their drive for independence. On the morning of July 20, 1810, Joaquín Camacho visited the Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón to see if his request to open a cabildo had been granted, but the viceroy {{dismissed}} the idea with arrogance. This caused the revolutionaries to begin devising a plot to launch their revolution. Using the arrival of Villavicencio as an excuse, they went to the house of José Gonzales Llorente to borrow a flower vase; he refused, and insulted them as well. Francisco José de Caldas seized on this incident to incite the crowds <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peninsulars, forcing José Miguel Pey, the mayor of Bogotá, to step in and save Llorente. By that night the situation had heated up so much that a special Cabildo was called in session. This led to its issuing the declaration of independence of New Granada from Spain.|$|E
25|$|The {{weakness}} of the Australian team was their batting, Don Bradman (99.94), Sid Barnes (63.05) and Lindsay Hassett (46.56) had all retired and had not been adequately replaced. Arthur Morris (46.48) and Neil Harvey (48.42) {{were still in the}} team and made centuries in the 1st Test, but Morris had been dropped off Alec Bedser on 0 then failed 6 times and before being dropped himself. Harvey made a brave, undefeated 92 at Sydney against the pace of Tyson and Statham and was the only specialist batsman to play in all five Tests, but he also failed at the end. Of the other batsmen only Colin McDonald in the last two Tests was able <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> England attack. Australia did have strength in depth, Keith Miller (36.97), Alan Davidson (24.59), Ron Archer (24.58), Richie Benaud (24.45) and Ray Lindwall (21.15) were all-rounders of Test class, but lacked the skills to master high class pace and only Lindwall (64 not out at Brisbane) made fifty. Captain Ian Johnson topped the Australian batting averages (116 at 58.00) by dint of batting at number ten and being not out 4 times in 6 innings.|$|E

25|$|Ethel {{had never}} had children, a fact that she regretted in her old-age and so Willy became her {{surrogate}} child, and she loves him dearly. Willy goes everywhere that Ethel goes and so she is devastated when he is kidnapped in 1986. She searches for him everywhere and even holds a seance {{to see if she}} can contact him, but Willy is nowhere to be found. Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) works on the case and eventually finds Willy in the possession of an old Latvian refugee, who has renamed him Rasputin. Willy is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get him to relinquish ownership. Ethel has been a lifelong friend of Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) and the trio remain close in their old-age. They can often be found reminiscing or gossiping in The Queen Victoria public house, where Ethel also regularly thrills the punters with her repartee, her version of the cancan, or her plain sense of fun. Out of the three Ethel is the most light-hearted and she is never frightened <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> over-bearing Lou and interfering Dot. She has her run-ins with both over the years, and yet their friendship endures right to the last.|$|E
