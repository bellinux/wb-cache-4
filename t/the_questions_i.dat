2500|$|In [...] "It's All Your Fault", Pink blames {{her lover}} for giving her {{hopes of a}} love relationship, then simply giving up on her. She proclaims in the lyrics [...] "I conjure up {{the thought of being}} gone, but I’d {{probably}} even do that wrong." [...] In [...] "Glitter in the Air", Pink asks many questions such as, [...] "Have you ever looked fear in the face and said I just don’t care?", and [...] "Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?" [...] Pink admits, [...] "I still don’t have some of the answers to <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> pose on this record. I’m still figuring it all out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jim Hacker first {{appears in}} Yes Minister having been {{recently}} re-elected as Member of Parliament for Birmingham East, soundly defeating his opponents. His early character {{is that of}} a very gung-ho, albeit naive, politician, ready to bring sweeping change into his department, unaware that Sir Humphrey and the civil service are out to stop any semblance of change, despite their insistence that they are his allies. Hacker is also noted as having challenged Humphrey while {{he was a member of}} the Opposition by asking difficult questions when Sir Humphrey was testifying to a Parliamentary committee: Sir Humphrey stated that Hacker had asked [...] "...all <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> hoped nobody would ask," [...] showing his new Minister to be at least a reasonably capable politician.|$|E

2500|$|The {{children}} {{were one of}} the chief inspirations for producing the Living Bible. Our family devotions were tough going because of the difficulty we had understanding the King James Version, which we were then using, or the Revised Standard Version, which we used later. All too often I would ask questions to be sure the children understood, and they would shrug their shoulders—they didn't know what the passage was talking about. So I would explain it. I would paraphrase it for them and give them the thought. It suddenly occurred to me one afternoon that I should write out the reading for that evening thought by thought, rather than doing it on the spot during our devotional time. So I did, and read the chapter to the family that evening with exciting results—they knew the answers to all <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> asked! ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of the Iraq war, on October 11, 2002 Cantwell voted in favor of the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq. Her October 10, 2002, press release, however, quotes her as stating {{on the floor of the}} U.S. Senate, [...] "... Mr. President, my vote for this {{resolution}} does not mean that I am convinced of the Administration has answered all <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>I</b> believe the following issues must be addressed before the U.N. or the U.S. move forward with military action." [...] Cantwell detailed six specific areas in which her questions and concerns had yet to be satisfactorily addressed at the time of her vote to authorize war: [...] "First: Continued Multilateral Approach ... Second: Successful Military Strategy ... Third: A Postwar Commitment Strategy ... Fourth: Fighting the Broader War on Terrorism ... Fifth: Maintaining Middle East Stability ... Sixth: Protecting Iraqi Civilians." ...|$|E

60|$|Fla. If you had {{not asked}} <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> <b>I</b> should have thought you had come from {{watching}} him; he's just gone off with Melissa's daughters.|$|R

6000|$|The cool Buchan was {{the first}} to speak, and hint the loss of time. [...] "I submit," [...] said he, [...] "that ye're {{traveling}} away from <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> put concerning progress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} decide. If he made those representations, we may force him {{to tell the truth}} rather than stand a suit for obtaining money under false representations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} excuse me, {{is not that}} beside <b>the</b> <b>question?</b> <b>I</b> engaged to remove the boulder, and I have done it," [...] he answered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that is <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> take it {{for granted}} that either Frank or Mary has told you that they have engaged {{themselves}} to each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. No. But what an {{extraordinary}} thing, John! Marlow, of course, {{is out of}} <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> 'm certain none of the maids as for cook! ...|$|R
6000|$|For my own part, I was bewildered. All <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> had {{not asked}} before came {{crowding}} {{to my mind}} how. Whose child was this? Whence had he come? What was the meaning of it all? ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bruff {{proved to}} be too busy to give me {{more than a minute}} of his {{valuable}} time. In that minute, however, he contrived to dispose--in the most discouraging manner--of all <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> had to put to him.|$|E
6000|$|Violet slowly {{raised her}} head, {{and looked at}} him with hazy eyes. “I think we shall always be grateful—and you must have felt it—you were his friend,” she said. “I can’t ask <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> wish to know—you will come back again?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet, if {{they did}} it wrong," [...] I said, [...] "you couldn't argue <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> don't know why: but I agree that it couldn't be done." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Did it {{hurt his}} {{feelings}} {{very much to}} wear our clothes? Didn't he rebel when {{he put on a}} pair of trousers for the first time?

6000|$|... 'The answer {{which you}} gave me so fully and {{distinctly}} to <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> proposed for your consideration was of value in turning to my view {{certain aspects of the}} case which I had not before observed.

5000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to answer that, no matter how you put <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> will discuss {{everything}} unless it hurts my people, my friends and the army." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will now}} ask thee a few questions, old man," [...] said the General, {{when they had}} arrived in the room; [...] "and I warn thee, that hope of pardon for thy many and persevering efforts against the Commonwealth, can be no {{otherwise}} merited than by the most direct answers to <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> am about to ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of making silly {{conditions}} like that!" [...] the man grumbled. [...] "If I knew where they were, I'd earn the quid soon enough, but I don't, and that's the long and the short of it!

6000|$|... "That," [...] he said coldly, [...] "is out of <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> <b>I</b> {{would not}} sell {{at the last}} market price. Besides, you have {{hitherto}} acted as my broker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since you ask <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> <b>I</b> may say this--If Miss Chisholm has two lady {{visitors}} {{during the}} next few days, you might make sure that she sees them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's not <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> {{am talking}} sense. You've {{got a chance}} now to put one of these bordermen out of the way. Do it quick! That's my advice." ...|$|R
