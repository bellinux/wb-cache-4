5|$|The Burnham-on-Sea Area Rescue Boat {{now known}} as BARB Search & Rescue {{was set up in}} 1992 to fund and operate rescue craft in the Bridgwater Bay area. BARB's boat house on the sea front was built in 1994 by the Challenge Anneka TV show. In 2002, Lelaina Hall, a five-year-old girl from Worcester, died on the mud flats before help could reach her. <b>The</b> <b>outcry</b> over her death {{prompted}} a Western Daily Press campaign to fund an inshore hovercraft.|$|E
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{remained a}} strong influence though, and when new breweries were set up, <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> led to the Welsh Sunday Closing Act in 1881, an act that forced the closure of public houses in Wales on a Sunday. Wales' passion for beer remained; the Wrexham Lager Beer Company opened in 1881, as the first lager producer in Britain. The Felinfoel Brewery {{made a deal with}} the local tin works and became the first brewery in Europe to put beer in cans.|$|E
5|$|New Line {{believed}} Freddy vs. Jason {{needed a}} fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Hodder {{was the best}} choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E

5|$|Crispi’s good {{intentions}} {{got lost in}} <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> for strong measures. In the three weeks of uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti’s ban {{on the use of}} firearms. In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government building were burned as well as flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished. Eleven people were killed on December 10, 1893, in Giardinello after a rally that asked for the abolition of taxes on food and disbandment of the local field guards (guardie campestri). The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. On December 17, 1893, many people were wounded when troops fired on a manifestation in Monreale. Another 11 protestors were killed in Lercara Friddi on December 25. On January 1, 1894, 20 people were killed and many wounded in Gibellina and Pietraperzia. On January 2, there two dead in Belmonte Mezzagno and the next day 18 dead and many wounded in Marineo. Two days after, on January 5, thirteen dead and many wounded closed the series in Santa Caterina.|$|E
5|$|The protests {{were part}} of the Buddhist crisis, during which the Buddhist {{majority}} in South Vietnam campaigned for religious equality after nine people were killed by government forces while defying a ban that prevented them from flying the Buddhist flag on Vesak. The incident prompted the United States to privately threaten to withdraw support for Diệm's government and when the Americans finally reduced aid a few months later, the army took it as a green light for a coup. An inquiry determined that the chemical used in the attack was a liquid component from old French tear gas grenades that had never functioned properly. The findings exonerated the ARVN soldiers from charges that they had used poison or mustard gas. <b>The</b> <b>outcry</b> over the attack had already forced Diệm to appoint a panel of three cabinet ministers to meet with Buddhist leaders for negotiations regarding religious equality. The talks led to the signing of the Joint Communique, but the policy changes it provided were not implemented and widespread protests continued, leading to the assassination of Diệm in a military coup.|$|E
5|$|While {{the plan}} was {{approved}} by the city in 1972, it aroused keen opposition from preservationist, environmentalist, and religious groups. In response to <b>the</b> <b>outcry,</b> the city department of town planning submitted a scaled-back design calling for an above-ground traffic system, a pedestrian plaza fronting Jaffa Gate, the retention of facades along Mamilla and King Solomon Streets, and the demolition of historic buildings only {{in the heart of the}} Mamilla valley. Though Safdie incorporated these suggestions into a new plan submitted in 1976, opposition continued unabated by such bodies as the Jerusalem District Planning Commission, the Jerusalem Merchants Association, and the Council for a Beautiful Israel. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, the city spent NIS 130 million to move over 700 families out of Mamilla to the Neve Yaakov, Pisgat Ze'ev, Katamon, and Baka neighborhoods. Workshops and garages were relocated to Talpiot, where they formed the core of the nascent Talpiot industrial zone.|$|E

25|$|The next day, on October 27, {{the police}} fired upon a caravan of Nationalists {{in the town}} of Peñuelas, and killed four of them. This police {{massacre}} inflamed many in Puerto Rico, and <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> was immediate.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} outlets did {{restrict}} coverage in ensuing days due to public outcry, while many Mid-Atlantic region stations {{decided to stop}} airing it altogether after the first night, because of <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> from the public.

25|$|The preface of {{the catalog}} {{was written by}} the French Socialist {{politician}} Marcel Sembat who a year earlier—against <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> of Jules-Louis Breton {{regarding the use of}} public funds to provide the venue (at the Salon d'Automne) to exhibit 'barbaric' art—had defended the Cubists, and freedom of artistic expression in general, in the National Assembly of France.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{and critics}} {{have argued that}} Nixon's {{decision}} to ban biological weapons was purely politically motivated.

It was also seen as a way to progress arms-control talks, additionally it could have stymied <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> over the use of non-lethal chemical agents in Vietnam. In reality, the issue was much more complex than even those reasons suggest.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 1906, {{the size}} of the High Court was {{increased}} to five Justices, and Deakin appointed H. B. Higgins and Isaac Isaacs to the High Court.

25|$|Although Baker {{claimed that}} his {{relationship}} with the woman was a love-affair which had not yet been consummated, <b>the</b> <b>outcry</b> surrounding the incident led to a series of accusations of impropriety on Baker's part, including the admissions by several female members of the community that they had had affairs with Baker before or during his tenure as abbot.

25|$|As the Volunteers marched from Howth back to Dublin, {{however, they}} {{were met by}} a large patrol of the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the British Army.
