40|$|Do {{political}} parties respond <b>to</b> <b>shifts</b> in {{the preferences of}} their supporters, which we label the partisan constituency model, or <b>to</b> <b>shifts</b> in the mean voter position (the general electorate model) ? Cross-national analyses - based on observations from Eurobarometer surveys and parties' policy programmes in 15 countries from 1973 to 2002 - suggest that the general electorate model characterizes the policy shifts of mainstream parties. Alternatively, when we analyse the policy shifts of Communist, Green and extreme Nationalist parties (i. e. 'niche' parties), we find that these parties respond <b>to</b> <b>shifts</b> in the mean position of their supporters. The findings have implications for spatial theories and political representation. © The Author(s) 2010...|$|R

Also, do electoral systems mediate these crucial citizen-party linkages? The central finding of this chapter is that electoral systems do condition these effects. Parties in proportional systems are systematically responsive to the mean voter position while parties in disproportional systems do not display the same tendency. Additionally, neither system induces parties to systematically respond to their supporters...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{comprises}} {{a series}} of studies investigating the effects of oxytocin on facial emotion recognition. Study I and Study II examined whether the effects of oxytocin on emotion recognition are related <b>to</b> <b>shifts</b> in overt and/or covert attention. To this end, participants’ eye gaze and pupil size were recorded while they performed an emotion recognition task that involved the presentation of dynamically changing expressions. Oxytocin enhanced participants’ recognition sensitivity for all expressions, irrespective of the expressions’ emotional valence. These effects appeared to be due <b>to</b> <b>shifts</b> in covert rather than overt attention because oxytocin affected participants’ pupil size but not eye gaze during face processing. Study III further examined whether oxytocin-induced changes in emotion recognition are unrelated <b>to</b> <b>shifts</b> in overt attention. To this end, participants performed an emotion recognition task that involved the masked presentation of static expressions. Oxytocin enhanced participants’ recognition accuracy for all expressions, presumably due <b>to</b> <b>shifts</b> in covert rather than overt attention because the task design precluded any gaze changes during face processing. Taken together these studies suggest that oxytocin generally improves the recognition of various facial expressions, {{even in the absence of}} overt attention shifts...|$|R
