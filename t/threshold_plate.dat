Chemical ablation of primary afferents, induced in either neonatal or adult rats by systemic administration of capsaicin, increased thermal nociceptive <b>threshold</b> (hot <b>plate),</b> irrespective of 6 -hydroxydopamine pretreatment and reduced substance P-Iike immunoreactivity in the hind-paw skin of either control or sympathectomized rats. Capsaicin pretreatment of neonatal but not adult rats produced antinociceptive effect in the tail-immersion test and completely reversed the hyperalgesic effect of sympathectomy, without affecting levels of substance P-like immunoreactivity in the tail skin. These findings indicate that sympathetic nerves and different subsets of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents {{are involved in the}} processing of thermal nociceptive input. Corneal and cutaneous lesions were induced by neonatal sensory denervation with capsaicin. Sympathectomy afforded protection against the development of corneal pathology, while it did not affect the occurrence of cutaneous lesions. It appears that a balance in the neuronal activity between sympathetic neurons and trigeminal sensory neurons is critical for maintaining the normal trophism of the cornea, and that sensory neuropeptides {{play a key role in}} the maintenance of normal trophism of the skin...|$|R

40|$|Ingested {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} are postulated {{to lead to}} changes in central nervous system activity, presumably by altering the lipid composition of neuronal membranes. In support of this hypothesis, we and other investigators have previously demonstrated cognitive effects in rats fed oils that contain both alpha-linolenic acid (18 : 3 omega 3) and linoleic acid (18 : 2 omega 6), with the relative content of alpha-linolenic acid being seen as the critical variable.

The model is a cantilever plate which experiences flutter when the flow velocity exceeds a certain <b>threshold.</b> The <b>plate</b> spans the entire wind-tunnel width but clearance inevitably exists between the plate edges and the wind-tunnel side-walls. Such clearance causes three-dimensional flow around the plate. In this work, we quantify the 3 D effect by varying the clearance.

The side clearance varies from 0. 1 to 5. 0 mm with an undisturbed clamp-plate system. The result demonstrates that the critical velocity decreases significantly with the decrease of the clearance in this interesting range of the clearance, a phenomenon which has not been investigated systematically in previous literature.

The most crucial part in Car Plate Recognition System is plate location. This is because if the system fails to detect {{the location of the}} car plate, then the whole system is a failure because recognition can only be done after successful plate location. Therefore, this research is mainly focused on plate location. In short, this research is entitled Car Plate Detection System.

40|$|SummaryBackground and purpose: Histamine is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{present in}} the brain of mammals which produces its physiological effects on target cells by stimulation of three types of receptors H 1, H 2 and H 3. Various reports nowadays indicate the role of histamine in reduction of pain transmission. This {{study was designed to}} determine the role of histamine receptors in reduction of pain. Materials and Methods: In this study, effects of different histamine receptor agonists and antagonists on the nociceptive threshold were investigated in mice by thermal (hot plate) and chemical (acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing) stimuli. Results: Intracerebroventricular (I. C. V.) injection of the histamine H 1 receptor agonist HTMT (50 μ g per mouse) produced a significant hypernociceptive response in the hot plate and writhing tests. This dose of HTMT had no significant effect on the motor coordination on rota rod test. Intra peritoneal(I. P) injection of histamine H 1 receptor antagonist, dexchloropheniramine (30 and 40 mg/kg) and diphenhydramine (20 and 40 mg/kg) caused a dose dependent antinociception in both tests. But since all the doses of dephenhydramine in this experiment caused motor impairment in rota rod, it seems that diphenhydramine is not a real pain antagonist. Combined injection of HTMT with dexchlorpheniramine (20 mg/kh, i. p) did not change pain <b>threshold</b> in hot <b>plate</b> teat. The histamine H 2 receptor agonist, dimaprit (50 and 100 μ gm per mouse, I. C. V) and ranitidine, histamine H 2 receptor antagonist (50 and 100 μ gm per mouse, I. C. V) raised the pain threshold in both hot plate and writhing tests. Histamine H 2 receptor agonist, imetit(25 - 50 mg/kg, I. P.) and histamine H 3 receptor antagonist, thioperamide (25 and 50 mg/kg, I. P.) decreased or increased pain <b>threshold</b> in hot <b>plate,</b> respectively. The dose of 25 mg/kg, I. P. of thioperamide significantly antagonized hyper nociceptive response induced by imetit. Conclusion: These results suggest that histamine receptor mechanisms have a retrogative effect on the pain caused by hot plate...|$|R

Aims: To examine the hyperalgesic state induced by ovariectomy in adult rats {{and its relation to}} some oxidative stress outcomes. Methods: The female Wistar rats were divided into normal, sham ovariectomized (OVX) and OVX groups, which were tested for mechanical and thermal hypernociception during 6 weeks and a single acetic acid-induced test 6 weeks after surgery. Redox biomarkers determinations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity, glutathione (GSH) and nitrates/nitrites as an indicator of nitric oxide (NO) concentrations were determined in the brain and cerebellum of 6 animals of each group. Results: Exclusivity OVX rats developed a robust state of mechanical hypernociception and allodynia in the abdomen, hindlimbs and proximal tail. Besides, thermal pain <b>thresholds</b> (hot <b>plate)</b> decreased. That was established 3 - 4 weeks after OVX and lasted for the 6 weeks of the experiment. Increases in visceral sensitivity were also observed in OVX rats. SOD enzyme activity decreased in OVX rats, which showed major deficit for this enzymatic defense under visceral inflammatory injury. However GSH concentrations were increased in brain of OVX animals that allow the balance during acute inflammation. NO concentrations were raised only in OVX rats exposure to chemical inflammatory injury. Conclusions: OVX in rats provide a useful model, which mimics the functional pain in females that could be related with brain oxidative stress...|$|R

This paper presents two novel techniques for kinematic heel strike instant (kHSI) detection which examined maximal resultant horizontal heel displacement (HHD).

Methanol extract at dose of 500 mg kg - 1 showed higher activity (97. 7 % writhing inhibition) than diclofenac 50 mg kg - 1 i. p., (77. 8 %, p< 0. 05) and morphine 5 mg kg - 1 i. p.

The two experiments are not related and {{should not be confused with}} each other. The pinhole neutron {{experiment is}} very similar to the optical pinhole camera in which light passing through a pinhole in an opaque screen produces an inverted image of the source. In the pinhole neutron experiment 14 Mev neutrons from a thermonuclear device travel in straight. lines from their respective points of origin outward in all directions. Those which pass through a pinhole in an opaque neutron shield make an inverted neutron image of the source. Some of the neutrons which form the image are captured by <b>threshold</b> detector <b>plates</b> which have been suitably located behind the pinhole. Neutrons that have sufficient energy react with the nuclei of the detector plate to form radioactive nuclei that by their decay locate the position of the image on the plate. The image may be made visible by autoradiography or counting techniques. In the autoradiograph, an x-ray film is placed in contact with the image plate. As the radioactive nuclei decay, they expose the film. The image is visible when the film has been adequately exposed and developed. In the counting method, the image plate is cut into small pieces; each the size of a resolution element. Each piece is separately counted. The number of neutrons causing its radioactivity is determined and plotted on a drawing of the plate. These numbers indicate the shape of the D-T plasma at the time of ``burn``.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the antioxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities of the methanolic extract of Piper betle leaves (MPBL). Materials and Methods: MPBL was evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced hind paw edema model. Analgesic activity of MPBL was evaluated by hot plate, writhing, and formalin tests. Total phenolic and flavonoids content, total antioxidant activity, scavenging of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, peroxynitrate (ONOO) as well as inhibition of total ROS generation, and assessment of reducing power were used to evaluate antioxidant potential of MPBL. Results: The extract of MPBL, at the dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg, produced a significant (p< 0. 05) increase in pain <b>threshold</b> in hot <b>plate</b> method whereas significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced the writhing caused by acetic acid and the number of licks induced by formalin in a dose-dependent manner. The same ranges of doses of MPBL caused significant (p< 0. 05) inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema after 4 h in a dose-dependent manner. In DPPH, ONOO-, and total ROS scavenging method, MPBL showed good antioxidant potentiality with the IC 50 value of 16. 33 ± 1. 02, 25. 16 ± 0. 61, and 41. 72 ± 0. 48 µg/ml, respectively with a significant (p< 0. 05) good reducing power.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo unveil the {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) distribution of talocrural and posterior subtalar articular cartilage thickness {{in the elderly}} cadavers using 3 D computed tomography (CT) and a 3 D-digitizer and to evaluate the relationship between subchondral bone plate density and the overlying cartilage thickness. DesignSixteen tali and 16 calcanei from eight cadavers were scanned with 3 D-CT to create bone surface models, and with a 3 D-digitizer to make cartilage surface models. These two surface models were merged using surface registration method. Articular cartilage thickness was evaluated as {{the distance between the}} two models, and the distribution was mapped. The anatomic cartilage thickness of five tali and five calcanei was compared with the distance between the cartilage and bone surface models to calculate optimum threshold for extracting the subchondral bone plate. Generalized estimating equations were used for comparison and measurement errors. Canonical correlation analysis was performed to determine the strength of association between subchondral bone <b>plate</b> <b>threshold</b> and cartilage thickness. ResultsThe talar-subtalar articular cartilage tended to be the thickest of the three joints. In the talocrural joint, the anterior region was the thinnest, and increasing cartilage thickness was seen toward the posterior. In the talar-subtalar joint, the central region was the thickest. Mean measurement errors were 0. 059 ± 0. 066 mm, 0. 038 ± 0. 040 mm, and 0. 018 ± 0. 065 mm in the talocrural, talar-subtalar, and calcaneal-subtalar joints, respectively. The canonical correlation coefficient was 0. 995 (P< 0. 001). ConclusionsThe articular cartilage thickness was distributed in the elderly hindfoot.

40|$|Release of {{adenosine}} {{from the}} spinal cord contributes to spinal antinociception by morphine. Morphine induces a Ca++-dependent release of adenosine from dorsal spinal cord synaptosomes, which is augmented under partially depolarizing conditions. The present study examined the opioid receptor subtypes involved in this release, and determined whether adenosine is an important mediator of antinociception induced by the spinal administration of selective opioid agonists in rats. Nanomolar and micromolar concentrations of the selective mu opioid agonists DAMGO [D-Ala 2,N-Me- Phe 4,Gly 5 -ol]enkephalin and PLO 17 [N-MePhe 3,D-Pro 4]morphiceptin induced release of adenosine in a biphasic manner {{in the presence of}} a partial depolarization (addition of 6 mM K+ to the Krebs’ medium). The delta opioid agonists DPDPE [D-Pen 2,D-Pen 5] enkephalin and DELT [D- Ala 2,Cys 4]deltorphin and the kappa opioid agonist U 50488 H trans-(±) - 3, 4 -dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2 -(1 -pyrroli-zemeacetamide had little effect on the release of adenosine except at high micromolar concentrations. Release of adenosine by mu (nanomolar) and delta (micromolar) ligands is Ca++- dependent, whereas the kappa (micromolar) receptor ligand releases adenosine via a Ca++-independent mechanism. Behavioral antinociception using the hot- <b>plate</b> <b>threshold</b> test revealed that intrathecal administration of the mu and delta opioid receptor agonists produced dose-dependent antinociception with an order of potency of DAMGO, PLO 17 > morphine, DELT > DPDPE. An ED 75 dose of morphine, DAMGO or PLO 17 was attenuated dose-dependently by intrathecal pretreatment with the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine. Caffeine did not block the antinociceptive response to delta agonists, but in fact augmented antinociception when combined with DPDPE and DELT. This augmentation was dose-dependent. This study demonstrates that activation of the mu receptor subtype is responsible for the opioid-induced release of adenosine from {{the spinal cord}}, that such release contributes to the spinal antinociception by mu agonists and that only release evoked by low doses of opioids is behaviorally relevant...|$|R
40|$|The vibrissal {{system of}} {{pinnipeds}} relies on sturdy, specialized vibrissae and supporting neural architecture apparently {{designed for the}} reception of waterborne disturbances. Although {{it is known that}} pinnipeds can use their vibrissae for fine-scale tactile discrimination and hydrodynamic detection, many aspects of vibrissal function remain poorly understood. The present work examined the adaptive significance of vibrissal structure, the sensitivity of the vibrissal system, and the signals received by this system. All of these points were considered with respect to their function in hydrodynamic reception. Four methods of study: laser vibrometry, computed tomography (CT) scanning, psychophysical testing and animal-borne tagging were used to investigate the functioning of this sensory system. Laser vibrometer recordings were used to investigate the effect of vibrissal surface structure and orientation on flow-induced vibrations in excised vibrissae. Vibrations were recorded from the shaft of excised vibrissae exposed to laminar water flow in a flume tank. Samples from three pinniped species were tested: the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). The vibrissae of the seals had an undulated surface structure, while the vibrissae of the sea lion had a smooth surface. No significant difference between species, and therefore surface structure, was observed. However, when vibrissae were tested at three angles of orientation to the water flow, a strong effect of orientation on vibration frequency and velocity was observed across species. CT scanning data revealed that the vibrissae of all the species tested had flattened cross-sectional profiles. This cross-sectional flattening could account for the observed orientation effects. Furthermore, this morphological characteristic may represent an adaptation for improved functioning in the aquatic environment by reducing self-induced-noise from swimming and potentially enhancing detection of signals from other planes. Psychophysical testing was conducted with a trained harbor seal in order to investigate the sensitivity of the vibrissal system of this species. A behavioral procedure was used to measure absolute detection thresholds for sinusoidal stimuli delivered to the vibrissae by a vibrating <b>plate.</b> <b>Thresholds</b> were measured at 9 discrete frequencies from 10 to 1000 Hz. The seal 2 ̆ 7 s performance in this stimulus detection task showed that the vibrissal array was sensitive to directly coupled vibrations across the range of frequencies tested, with best sensitivity of 0. 09 mm/s at 80 Hz. The velocity thresholds as a function of frequency showed a characteristic U-shaped curve with a gradual low-frequency roll-off below 80 Hz and a steeper high-frequency roll-off above 250 Hz. The thresholds measured for the harbor seal in this study were about 100 times more sensitive than previous in-air measures of vibrissal sensitivity for this species. The results were similar to those reported by others for the detection of waterborne vibrations, but show an extended range of frequency sensitivity. Animal-borne tagging methods were used to investigate the signals received by the vibrissae and better understand the relevant signal components involved in hydrodynamic detection. A novel tagging system, wLogger, was developed to record vibrations directly from a vibrissa by means of an accelerometer coupled to the vibrissal shaft. Laboratory testing using excised whiskers in a water flume confirmed that the tag is capable of recording vibrational signals without hampering the natural movement of the vibrissa. In addition, the tag successfully measured vibrations from the vibrissae of a harbor seal during active swimming and hydrodynamic detection. Live animal testing, along with the supplemental recordings from excised vibrissae, revealed that interaction with hydrodynamic disturbances disrupted the vibrational signal received by the whisker. When exposed to a hydrodynamic signal, whisker vibrations increased in bandwidth, spreading energy across a wider range of frequencies. This finding suggests that modulation of the vibrational signal may {{play a key role in}} the detection of hydrodynamic stimuli by the seal. The results of this dissertation research provide insight into the functioning of the vibrissal system in pinnipeds and establishes the groundwork for future pathways of investigation. By investigating the vibrissal system from the focal points of structure, sensitivity and received signals, a more comprehensive understanding of this refined sensory modality is emerging...|$|R
