5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor <b>to</b> <b>mediate</b> discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <b>to</b> <b>mediate.</b> To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E

Bohemond agreed to restore confiscated church property and Aimery lifted the interdict, but Bohemond's excommunication remained in force because he refused to return to Theodora.

40|$|This article {{examines}} individual variability in empathizing and systemizing abilities (Baron-Cohen, 2003, 2009) on emotional responses <b>to</b> <b>mediated</b> violence. It is predicted that these abilities influence feelings of distress and enjoyment while processing violent media {{and that they}} interact with the motives for aggressive behavior - whether the violence was justified or not. Psychophysiological measures of negative and positive valence activation and arousal were recorded for 90 participants while they were exposed to fourteen full-motion film clips that contained violence that was either justified or not by the narrative. Results show unjustified content led to greater physiological arousal and greater negative valence activation overall and to a significantly greater extent in highly empathetic viewers. Advantages of employing the empathizing-systemizing theory <b>to</b> <b>mediated</b> violence research are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{mediated}} {{communication was}} much rarer than face-to-face one. Even through humans possessed {{the technology to}} use technology to communicate {{in space and time}} for millennia, the majority of world's population lacked skills such as literacy to use them. This began to change with the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg that led to the spread of printed texts and rising literacy in Europe from the 15th century. Since then, face-to-face interaction has begun to steadily lose ground <b>to</b> <b>mediated</b> communication. Face-to-face communication has been however described as less preferable <b>to</b> <b>mediated</b> communication in some situations, particularly where time and geographical distance are an issue. For example, in maintaining a long-distance friendship, face-to-face communication was only the fourth most common way of maintaining ties, after telephone, email, and instant messaging.|$|R

METHOD: Current information habits were assessed; A tailored information intervention was provided; Use of resources against outcomes defined by previous studies was evaluated. FINDINGS: The information intervention {{had a significant impact on}} reduction of adverse events and physicians' decision patterns. CONCLUSION: Provision of information tools in support of clinical decision making at the point of care, and training in their use, can have as positive an impact on physician decision making and potential for reduction of adverse events in rural health care as access <b>to</b> <b>mediated</b> information services...|$|R
