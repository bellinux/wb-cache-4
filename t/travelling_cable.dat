40|$|The {{performance}} of lift (elevator) systems {{deployed in the}} modern tall built environment can be substantially affected by adverse environmental conditions suchs as seismic (earthquake) activities (as well as strong winds). The building motion (sway) which is induced by those environmental conditions excites the lift system elastic components such as suspension / compensating ropes, belts and cables. A complex dynamic situation arises when the building is excited near its natural frequency which in turn approaches the natural frequency of the ropes. In this scenario resonances interactions phenomena take place. These phenomena severely affect lightly tensioned compensating ropes, as well as <b>travelling</b> <b>cables,</b> that sway at {{the frequency of the}} building displaying non-planar responses. Thus, the lift system designers have to take into consideration the critical characteristics of the building structure before the lift installation is constructed and installed. In this presentation the excitation mechanism is explianed and the dynamic analysis of responses of lift ropes is discussed. Suitable control strategies can then be developed and applied to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses arising in the building – lift system...|$|R
5000|$|These traces were {{produced}} by a commercial TDR using a step waveform with a 25 ps risetime, a sampling head with a 35 ps risetime, and an 18 inch m SMA cable. The {{far end of the}} SMA cable was left open or connected to different adapters. It takes about 3 ns for the pulse to <b>travel</b> down the <b>cable,</b> reflect, and reach the sampling head. A second reflection (at about 6 ns) can be seen in some traces; it is due to the reflection seeing a small mismatch at the sampling head and causing another [...] "incident" [...] wave to <b>travel</b> down the <b>cable.</b>|$|R
2500|$|V-brakes {{function}} {{well with}} the suspension systems found on many mountain bikes {{because they do not}} require a separate cable stop on the frame or fork. Because of the higher mechanical advantage of V-brakes, they require brake levers with longer <b>cable</b> <b>travel</b> than levers intended for older types of brakes. [...] Mechanical (i.e. cable-actuated) disc brakes use the same amount of <b>cable</b> <b>travel</b> as V-brakes, except for those that are described as being [...] "road" [...] specific. As a general rule, mechanical disc brakes for so-called [...] "flat bar" [...] bicycles (chiefly mountain and hybrid bicycles) are compatible with V-brake levers, whereas mechanical disc brakes intended for [...] "drop-bar" [...] bicycles are compatible with the cable pull of older brake designs (cantilever, caliper, and U-brake).|$|R
50|$|Blu-ray {{equipment}} {{is required to}} implement the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections. This is aimed at preventing the copying of copyrighted content as it <b>travels</b> across <b>cables.</b> Through a protocol flag in the media stream called the Image Constraint Token (ICT), a Blu-ray Disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP-compliant link is not used. In order to ease the transition to high definition formats, the adoption of this protection method was postponed until 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the LNB {{is to use the}} {{superheterodyne}} principle to take a block (or band) of relatively high frequencies and convert them to similar signals carried at a much lower frequency (called the intermediate frequency or IF). These lower frequencies <b>travel</b> through <b>cables</b> with much less attenuation, so there is much more signal left at the satellite receiver end of the cable. It is also much easier and cheaper to design electronic circuits to operate at these lower frequencies, rather than the very high frequencies of satellite transmission.|$|R

50|$|Access Media Network (AMN) is a {{business}} automation and technology organization unifying speech, music, audio, images and movies with two-way communications. The core definition of the AMN, founded by Dale Burleigh Schalow in 1992, was a premise for consumer-based music access, originally called Accessible Music Network. A new music industry model encompassed three main tiers at its inception: 1) method of <b>travel</b> including <b>cable</b> TV, telephony, satellite and cellular; 2) hardware and software to play music after point-of-purchase; 3) business licensing model to levy single license issue, as well as monthly subscription plans of multiple licenses.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed at}} which energy or signals <b>travel</b> down a <b>cable</b> is {{actually}} {{the speed of the}} electromagnetic wave, not the movement of electrons.

25|$|The {{science of}} negative-index {{materials}} is being matched with conventional devices that broadcast, transmit, shape, or receive electromagnetic signals that <b>travel</b> over <b>cables,</b> wires, or air. The materials, devices and {{systems that are}} involved with this work could have their properties altered or heightened. Hence, this is already happening with metamaterial antennas and related devices which are commercially available. Moreover, in the wireless domain these metamaterial apparatuses continue to be researched. Other applications are also being researched. These are electromagnetic absorbers such as radar-microwave absorbers, electrically small resonators, waveguides that can go beyond the diffraction limit, phase compensators, advancements in focusing devices (e.g. microwave lens), and improved electrically small antennas.|$|R
