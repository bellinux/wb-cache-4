It also brought in new staff from its mother company Benpres who were inexperienced in water supply, which led to tensions and reduced the motivation of incumbent staff. Maynilad thus invested in expanding access in the Western zone, but due to its business model and the heavy load of inherited foreign-currency debt it soon ran into financial difficulties. It slowed down its investments, and in April 2001 it stopped paying <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>fee</b> to the government altogether. To avoid bankruptcy, the government had to provide bridge financing from state-owned Filipino banks to MWSS.

The former imposes the obligation to immediately undertake the investment required to roll-out the service. The latter allows the concessionaire to optimally decide the investment timing.

Natural gas distribution constitutes, due to its technical and economic features, a natural monopoly. For this reason, in the framework of the liberalization process, the Italian legislator has introduced, in addition to price regulation, competitive tenders in order to have different operators compete amongst each other for the service concession. After a brief overview of the economic theory referring to competition for the field and an overview of the Italian gas market, the critical aspects of the outlined regulatory framework will be highlighted. More particularly the main features of tenders will be assessed, while, in the following section, the meaning of the imposed revenue cap and its tie to <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>fee</b> will be explained. An analysis of possible reasons for extremely high concession fees will be carried out, evaluating their possible impact on companies' profitability.

Market fragmentation has diminished significantly over the years; however, the number of very small firms in the market is still high. In the competitive tender procedures held so far, the number of bidders and <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>fees</b> awarded have been high; however, regulatory loopholes and concerns over the ability of municipalities to organize and carry out competitive procedures have emerged. Tariff regulation has led to a reduction of distribution prices, but firms are highly profitable, which might indicate that they still enjoy significant rents. The uncertainty and variability of the tariff system and the delays in the implementation of third-party access regulation has hindered the development of competition in the residential gas market. The new rules on the size of local markets and on bidding criteria should significantly improve the regulatory framework of tenders.

40|$|Ecotourism is {{becoming}} more attractive because {{it is believed that}} it makes it possible to improve income generation without harming the environment. These goals are sometimes not met, however, and environmentally unfriendly or economically unsuccessful ecotourism tends to prevail in many developing countries, questioning the validity of its original concept. Therefore, careful assessment of cultural, environmental, and economic aspects is necessary when introducing ecotourism to a region. This paper uses choice experiments as a method to find tourists’ willingness to pay (WTP), and it analyzes preferences of tourists to assess the financial potential of the future ecotourism in the village of Uaxactún, Guatemala. Villagers in Uaxactún are faced with a need for another means of income to produce <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>fee</b> for the Maya Biosphere Reserve. With their traditional forest harvesting, which is their primary source of income, becoming unsustainable because of the influx of population into the village, villagers are interested in developing ecotourism. Three hypothetical ecotourism options were developed with input from the local residents, and three prices, reflecting potential costs, were developed for each option. The survey was conducted of 87 international tourists and 12 local tourists. Survey data were analyzed using the multinomial logit model. The result shows that both sets of tourists have marginal willingness to pay lower than the potential costs of ecotourism, suggesting the difficulty of financial success of ecotourism in Uaxactún. The results should be discussed in combination with the cultural and environmental aspects as the community decides whether to proceed with ecotourism-based development...|$|E

40|$|The {{underdeveloped}} {{countries which}} {{are rich in}} oil resources are putting up a fight against the exploitation policy of the world oil cartel. The body which is representing their interests is the OPEC organisation (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries). The setting up of this organisation {{was in fact a}} response of the oil producing countries to the successive reduction of the information price. OPEC is thus meant to constitute a kind of counterbalance to the world cartel, which is getting most of its crude oil on the territories of the OPEC countries. OPEC represents all Arab countries of the Near East, Venezuela, Indonesia, Libya. In the negotiations with the world cartel the OPEC brings forward numerous postulates. Some of them constitute subjects of this summary. One of the most important and complicated item are the information prices which serve as a basis for computing the royalties due to the governments of the oil producing countries. The next problem evolves around the regulation of the size of crude oil production. There are also some other problems, e. g. the problem of separating <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>fees</b> from <b>the</b> income tax, the problem of raising <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>fees</b> to 20 per cent of the information price or last but not least the problem of fixing a new proportion of dividing the profits on the 70 : 30 basis. The fight put up by OPEC by exclusively economic means — has no good prospects of success. The best way out of the difficulties seems to be the formation of native capital which would undertake the business of oil extraction and oil distribution. The fight with the world cartel is difficult because of. the political weakness of the oil countries, the anxiety concerning the oil distribution (the world's distribution network is mostly {{in the hands of the}} cartel) and the lack of native skilled labour. The attempts to nationalize the oil industry have taken place only in a few countries — they constituted, however, a bold example to the other oil producing countries. Lately the nationalization trend slackened somehow, on the other hand the formation of regional groupings are getting popular. There are at present two such organisations: ARPEL — the Organisation of State Oil Enterprises in Latin American Countries and APO — The Arab Oil Organisation. Of course the mere setting up of new organisations does not yet mean the end of the World Cartel — it does mean, however, that the times where it could control unconditionally the oil resources are definitely over.

Eventually, in December 2002 Maynilad requested the early termination of the contract. Despite the tariff increases and the lowered targets, Maynilad went bankrupt in 2003. The government did not call on Maynilad's performance bond, but rather took on three new foreign currency loans with a total value of US$431 million to finance the MWSS debt service. The government agreed to convert a small part of <b>the</b> unpaid <b>concession</b> <b>fees,</b> US$22.67 million, into an 84 percent equity share of Maynilad. The bulk of the unpaid fees were to be repaid over a longer period. The Filipino government neither returned West Manila to public management, nor accept Manila Water's offer to take over the entire metropolitan area, but offered its share in Maynilad for sale. In December 2006 a consortium of the Filipino construction company DM Consunji Holdings, Inc (DMCI) and the Filipino telecommunications/real estate company Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC) bought it for a low sales price of US$503.9 million. While many public tenders impose a high equity, {{this was not the case}} here. Also, the tender only required expertise in utilities management — including telecommunications and energy — not specifically water utilities management, which allowed a wider variety of bidders to come in. As of 20111, Suez continued to hold a 16 percent-minority share in Maynilad. By January 2008 the new owners had paid off the US$240 million debt to the government.|$|R
