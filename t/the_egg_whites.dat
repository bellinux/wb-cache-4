50|$|<b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are beaten {{with sugar}} and poured into a mould lined {{with a thin}} layer of caramel. Alternately, the whites can be shaped with spoons and allowed to cook gently in {{sweetened}} milk with vanilla flavoring. A custard is made using milk, sugar, vanilla, and egg yolks; the mix is cooked in a bain-marie for a few minutes, but must remain thin enough to pour. The custard is topped with <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> dumplings. The dish is served at room temperature or cold.|$|E

5000|$|Swiss Meringue is whisked over a {{bain-marie}} to warm <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> {{and then}} whisked steadily until it cools. This forms a dense, glossy marshmallow-like meringue. It is usually then baked.|$|E
50|$|Different {{equipment}} is used when preparing an angel food cake {{at home or}} in a small bakery as opposed to a large scale production. Many recipes found in cookbooks advise bakers to whip <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> in a copper bowl. The theory behind this is that the whisk incorporates copper particles or ovotransferrin, which is attached to copper particles, into <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> improving the flexibility and stability of the foam. Some research has found that the copper significantly increases the dilatational elasticity, which is the elasticity of the protein cell wall at the interface of air/water.|$|E
50|$|Egg albumen or {{egg whites}} {{acts as a}} trypsin {{inhibitor}} because egg whites are full of protein which allows trypsin to act upon <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> instead of steapsin. This allows the trypsin to be neutralized and allows steapsin's activity to remain unchanged.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} sloe gin fizz contains sloe gin (a blackthorn plum flavored spirit), lemon juice, simple syrup, <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> and carbonated water. A popular alternative eliminates <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b>|$|R

40|$|Chicken <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> was {{separated}} into protein fractions by electrophoresis on a square sheet of filter paper. Then bovine trypsin was applied {{on a line}} perpendicular to the zones of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins and <b>the</b> second electrophoresis {{was carried out in}} the direction perpendicular to the first run. In this way trypsin line crossed <b>the</b> zones of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins. Following results were obtained. 1) Trypsin line formed two peaks by the cross with the fractions of <b>the</b> chicken <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> <b>The</b> major peak was ascribed to the crossing of ovomucoid and the second minor one, to that of conalbumin. 2) Trypsin inhibiting activity of each fraction isolated by sectioning the paper electropherogram was measured using benzoylarginine p-nitroanilide and chymotrypsin inhibiting activity was measured using benzoyltyrosine p-nitroanilide. 3) The distribution curves of trypsin inhibitors measured enzymatically coincided with the curve of trypsin line which was crossed <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins and named the cross diagram of <b>the</b> chicken <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> against trypsin. 4) The peak of chymotrypsin inhibitor in the distribution curve corresponded to the minor second peak of the cross diagram against trypsin...|$|R
5000|$|The base {{provides}} the flavor and <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> provide the [...] "lift", or puffiness to the dish.

50|$|Egg whites may {{be added}} during {{simmering}} {{when it is}} necessary to clarify (i.e., purify, or refine a broth for a cleaner presentation). <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> will coagulate, trapping sediment and turbidity into an easily strained mass.

5000|$|Meringue ( [...] , [...] ) {{is a type}} of dessert, often {{associated}} with French, Swiss, and Italian cuisine, traditionally made from whipped egg whites and sugar, and occasionally an acidic ingredient such as lemon, vinegar or cream of tartar. A binding agent such as salt, cornstarch or gelatin may also be added to the eggs. The addition of powdered sugar, which usually contains corn starch, to the uncooked meringue produces a pavlova. The key to the formation of a good meringue is the formation of [...] by denaturing the protein ovalbumin (a protein in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites)</b> via mechanical shear. Meringues are often flavoured with vanilla, a small amount of almond, or coconut, although if extracts of these are used and are based on an oil infusion, an excess of fat from the oil may inhibit <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> from forming a foam.|$|E
50|$|Foam cakes are cakes {{with very}} little (if any) fatty {{material}} such as butter, oil or shortening. They are leavened primarily by the air that is beaten into <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> that they contain. They differ from butter cakes, which contain shortening, and baking powder or baking soda for leavening purposes. Foam cakes are typically airy, light and spongy.|$|E
5000|$|Egg whites play an {{integral}} {{role in the}} structure of the baked cake. Egg whites are composed of many proteins, however only ovalbumin, conalbuminm, lysozyme, and globulins [...] have properties which aid in creating a voluminous angel food cake. Ovalbumin and globulins will produce a foam that is equal or greater to the size of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{structurally}} distinct {{forms of}} eggwhite lysozyme (EC 3. 2. 1. 17) are known. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> of some species contains {{both of these}} forms, while <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> of other species appears to contain only {{one or the other}} of them. We have immunological and electrophoretic evidence that the chicken, which has only one lysozyme type in its <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> contains both types in its polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Experiments on Embden goose bone marrow showed that this tissue also contains both lysozymes, even though <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> of this species contains only one of them. Our studies suggest that many avian species have the genetic loci that code for both forms of lysozyme, but that a species-specific regulatory mechanism controls whether one or the other or both of them are expressed during <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> production. <b>The</b> fact that two distinct lysozymes are present in chicken leukocytes may be of significance to the antibacterial mechanism of these cells, especially in light of the fact that they lack myeloperoxidase, an important leukocyte enzyme in mammals...|$|R

50|$|Pantāga is a {{traditional}} Latvian dish, containing eggs and spices. It symbolically represents the sun, often prepared at Easter. It is often baked on an open flame outdoor fireplace or fire, usually in a round cast iron long stem pan. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> and yolks are beaten in a pan with spices, producing a form of scrambled egg. However, it is also common to place it in a microwave.|$|E
5000|$|Egg {{whites and}} sugar are both {{hygroscopic}} (water-attracting) chemicals. Consequently, meringue becomes soggy when refrigerated or {{stored in a}} high-humidity environment. This quality also explains the problem called [...] "weeping" [...] or [...] "sweating", in which beads of moisture form on all surfaces of the meringue. Sweating is a particular problem for French meringues in which the granulated sugar is inadequately dissolved in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> and for high-moisture pie fillings.|$|E

50|$|The whiskey sour {{is a mixed}} drink {{containing}} whiskey (often bourbon), lemon juice, sugar, and optionally, a dash of <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> With <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> it {{is sometimes}} called a Boston Sour. It is shaken and served either straight up or over ice.|$|R
50|$|An excess {{acidifier}} is also added, {{however it}} isn’t used {{in combination with}} the sodium bicarbonate. Instead it lowers the batter pH to facilitate the starch gelatinization and maintain <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> protein foam volume in the baking cake. At a lower pH, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins are able to entrap more air during both preparation and baking. The optimal pH for the batter is between 5.5 and 6.8. It also helps to create a whiter cake, which is more desirable to consumers. It is typical that the excess acidifier is the same as that used to react with the balanced chemical leavener.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{traditional}} method, {{also known as}} the angel food cake method is as follows. First <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> and possibly salt and cream of tartar, are mixed at a medium speed until a soft peak forms. Whipping continues while the sugar is slowly added. Once a hard peak is formed, [...] the flour is folded into the mixture of egg whites and sugar. This technique is done in order to disturb the foam as little as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Like other sponge cakes, ladyfingers {{traditionally}} {{contain no}} chemical leavening agent, {{and rely on}} air incorporated into the eggs for their [...] "sponge" [...] texture. However, some brands contain ammonium bicarbonate. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> and egg yolks mixed with sugar are typically beaten separately and folded together with flour. They contain more flour than the average sponge cake. The mixture is piped through a pastry bag in short lines onto sheets, giving the biscuits their notable shape.|$|E
50|$|Molten {{chocolate}} cakes {{are nearly}} always baked in ramekin dishes and have four main ingredients: butter, eggs, sugar, and chocolate. Like most cakes, this recipe uses flour. The butter and chocolate are melted together, while {{the eggs are}} either whisked with the sugar to form a thick paste, producing a denser finished product, or are separated so <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> can be whipped into an egg foam to provide more lift (and thus a lighter cake) when the mixture is baked.|$|E
50|$|An egg is {{surrounded}} by a thin, hard shell. Inside, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> yolk is suspended in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae (from the Greek word χάλαζα, meaning hailstone or hard lump).|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> avian <b>egg,</b> <b>the</b> yolk {{usually is}} some shade of yellow in colour. It is spherical and is {{suspended}} in <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> (known alternatively as albumen or glair/glaire) {{by one or}} two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae.|$|R
50|$|The Clover Club Cocktail is a {{cocktail}} consisting of Gin, Lemon Juice, Raspberry Syrup, and an <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> is not added {{for the purpose}} of giving the drink flavor, but rather acts as an emulsifier. Thus when the drink is shaken a characteristic foamy head is formed.|$|R
