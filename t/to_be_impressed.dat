5|$|On 17 May Gustavus {{landed with}} 8,000 reinforcements. On {{the night of}} 22–23 May, while {{crossing}} the Vistula near Kieżmark and Danzig, Gustavus encountered Polish forces. Wounded in the hip, {{he was forced to}} retreat. Koniecpolski then decided to take back Gniew and devised a diversionary plan. Polish forces were sent to attempt to take back Braniewo, forcing Gustavus to relieve the siege; then Gustavus followed the retreating Polish army and laid siege to Orneta. Koniecpolski, who had foreseen this, responded with a sudden attack on Gniew, his primary objective, which he captured. Gustavus was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> with the speed of Koniecpolski's reaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about three {{brothers}} who, traveling together, reach a treacherous river. They make a magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks {{for a way to}} stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E

25|$|Following the war, {{with most}} of the British Band killed and the rest {{captured}} or disbanded, the defeated Black Hawk was held in captivity at Jefferson Barracks near Saint Louis, Missouri together with Neapope, White Cloud, and eight other leaders. After eight months, in April 1833 they were taken east, as ordered by U.S. President Andrew Jackson. The men were taken by steamboat, carriage, and railroad, and met with large crowds wherever they went. Jackson wanted them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> with the power of the United States. Once in Washington, D.C., they met with Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass. Afterward, they were delivered to their final destination, prison at Fortress Monroe in Norfolk, Virginia. They were held only a few weeks at the prison, during which they posed for portraits by different artists.|$|E
25|$|Tom Yorkfield, a farmer, {{receives}} {{a visit from}} his half-brother Laurence. Tom has no great liking for Laurence or respect for his profession as a painter of animals. Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed,</b> but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold {{a painting of a}} different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should be worth more than his real bull. This and Laurence's condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour because he knows that, however valuable Laurence's painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia seemed not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was haemophilia, the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the coins}} could be struck, the edge {{lettering}} and devices had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> {{on the edge}} of the planchets. This action was performed with a device known as the Castaing machine; the machine stamped the edge with the words [...] "Hundred Cents One Dollar or Unit" [...] along with ornamentation. As production was inexact, many planchets intended for silver dollars were overweight. This was remedied by filing the face of the planchets; for this reason, the coins vary in weight more dramatically than later issues, which were minted with more precise equipment.|$|E
500|$|John Betjeman was {{a friend}} of the Grahams and was given the {{remaining}} two-year lease on the house, together with some of the furniture, on Mrs. Graham's death in 1962. Betjeman, a champion of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture, was an early admirer of Burges. In 1957 the Tower House had featured in the fifth episode of his BBC television series, An Englishman's Castle. In a radio interview of 1952 about Cardiff Castle Betjeman spoke of the architect and his foremost work: [...] "a great brain has made this place. I don't see how anyone can fail <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> by its weird beauty... awed into silence from the force of this Victorian dream of the Middle Ages." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for Entertainment Weekly, the Chicago Tribune, and Time {{were mixed}} or {{contained}} qualified praise. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in [...] "enough electronic marginal distinction {{to feed a}} coal town for a month" [...] and to compensate for how soulless the songs are, resulting in [...] "arid" [...] art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for The Independent, [...] "For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much {{the same sort of}} emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum and filmed in the first weekend of March 2002 in Los Angeles, California. It was produced under A Band Apart Productions, while the choreography for this version was also created by Brian Friedman. The full shooting took 23 hours, and Applebaum was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> with Spears' [...] "stamina and patience through the marathon shoot, which wrapped 5 a.m." [...] According to Joe D'Angelo of MTV, [...] "the clip furthers her 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman' crusade to shirk her adolescent image, as she and five friends outsmart her bodyguard with the old 'you're wanted elsewhere' trick and sneak out of a hotel and into an underground dance club." [...] It was released on March 26, 2002.|$|E
500|$|The album also {{received}} some negative criticism. Erlewine of AllMusic mentioned the album did not [...] "surprise or offer anything that wasn't already on The Chronic". Christopher John Farley noted Snoop Doggy Dogg had little examination over his emotions and feelings. David Browne spoke of [...] "Ain't No Fun", stating {{it was an}} example of how [...] "musically artful, yet lyrically repellent, this album can be" [...] and went on to say [...] "It's easy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> one moment and appalled the next". Renowned rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] rating, which signifies [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible." [...] Qs Danny Kelly observed: [...] "Snoop Doggy Dogg's record is more or less a 19-track homage to/gleeful rip off of George Clinton's 'Atomic Dog'... It's inclined to become a touch unimaginative; a tad, let's be honest, dull... And the sleeve competes with The Waterboys' Dream Harder and Billy Joel's River of Dreams as the worst attached to a recent release." ...|$|E
500|$|The Times {{gave the}} game four stars {{out of five}} {{and said it was}} [...] "more for 24 fans, who will {{instantly}} love it — so long as they don’t mind another TV addiction to feed." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating, [...] "Newcomers to the trials and tribulations of Jack Bauer are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> by this game's generic shooting and driving action. But fans of 24 will be quaking, thanks to the authentic atmosphere and gripping story, set between season two and three of the TV series." [...] However, The A.V. Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll wish you could skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in front of me. And the driving missions are worse." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1960 a preparatory Commission for the {{upcoming}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties scheduled for November that year was held from October 121, with the Albanian delegation being led by Hysni Kapo and Ramiz Alia. Alia later recalled that [...] "the aim of the Soviets was to ensure that our Party did not come out against their party and Khrushchev, did not bring the fight out in the open, and speak about Bucharest and the contradictions which existed. To this end, they created around our delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere, in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery." [...] Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram, writing to Kapo on October 13 that, [...] "We are not of the same opinion as those {{who are trying to}} smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations... We are for carrying the matter through to the end. If this is not understood, it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood. It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not, but it is essential that we, should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head, as they deserve... we shall not allow ourselves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> by those who say: 'How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals?' We say: Precisely to defend the Soviet Union and the Party of Lenin, these 'rascals' must be exposed, and there must be no toning down of criticism or covering up of the deviationists." ...|$|E
500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she {{really knows what}} she wants. She knows if she's trying something on that doesn't fit right for her. She's like, 'No, that's not me.' She's not one to strap {{on some sort of}} fake image." [...] Christy also claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of the}} sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E
