The results showed that total extract of the herb has a marked dose-dependent inhibitory effect on viability of MCF 7 cells (half maximal inhibitory concentration is 15 μg/ml). Cell viability of MCF 10 A was moderately decreased without visible dose-dependent effect. The saponin fraction has increased inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells compared to total extract. Morphological changes and DNA fragmentation were observed as markers for early and late apoptosis predominantly in tumor cells after treatment. Apoptotic processes were intensified with the increase of treatment duration. The obtained results are the first showing selective antitumor activity of Bulgarian <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> <b>L.</b> on human cancer cells in vitro.

Materials and Methods: Total aqueous extract of plant was prepared and in order to separate the components, liquid/liquid extraction method with Petroleum ether was used. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) system proved the existence of Benzoxazine derivative in the water and the third fractions. Antimicrobial effects of all extracts were examined against 10 Gram positive and negative and candida spp. by cup plate and disk diffusion methods. Also, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by micro dilution method. Results: The total extract showed antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. The fraction of Benzoxazine had no effect against tested microbes. MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination showed that B. subtilis had the low sensitivity to the total extract.

40|$|PURPOSE: Recurrence and {{persistent}} {{side effects of}} present day treatment for urolithiasis restrict their use, so an alternate solution, using phytotherapy is being sought. The present study attempted to evaluate the antilithiatic properties of <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> commonly called as “gokhru” which is often used in ayurveda to treat various urinary diseases including urolithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activity of <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> was investigated on nucleation {{and the growth of}} the calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals as well as on oxalate induced cell injury of NRK 52 E renal epithelial cells. RESULTS: <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> extract exhibited a concentration dependent inhibition of nucleation and the growth of CaOx crystals. When NRK- 52 E cells were injured by exposure to oxalate for 72 h, <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> extract prevented the injury in a dose-dependent manner. On treatment with the different concentrations of the plant, the cell viability increased and lactate dehydrogenase release decreased in a concentration dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The current data suggests that <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> extract not only has a potential to inhibit nucleation and the growth of the CaOx crystals but also has a cytoprotective role. Our results indicate that it could be a potential candidate for phytotherapy against urolithiasis...|$|R
40|$|Summary Where {{seed set}} was stopped {{over several years}} the number of {{innocent}} weed (Cenchrus long-ispinus (Hackel) Fern.) and caltrop (<b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> <b>L.)</b> plants that emerged declined and the seed banks of innocent weed declined. However, a reduction in innocent weed plant numbers of between 39 and 65 % reduced the amount of seed entering the seed bank by less than 10 % suggesting that to obtain a long term reduction in seed bank numbers {{it is necessary to}} stop all plants from setting seed. If these trends continue a {{reduction in the number of}} operations required to control summer weeds may be possible...|$|E

One such characteristic is a prominent, chlorenchymatous vascular bundle sheath in the leaves. It has been suggested that the presence of this sheath in dicotyledons can serve as a means of detecting low CO 2 -compensating species. We collected 88 dicotyledon species from 22 families reported to have chlorenchymatous sheaths. Of the 88, only three, <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris,</b> <b>L.,</b> Boerhaavia paniculata, L. C.

40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to solar UVB radiation damages skin, increasing {{the risk to}} develop cancer. Hence the identification of compounds with a photoprotective efficacy is essential. This study examined the role of saponins derived from <b>Tribulus</b> <b>terrestris</b> <b>L.</b> (TT) on the modulation of apoptosis in normal human keratinocytes (NHEK) exposed to physiological doses of UVB and to evaluate their antitumoral properties. In NHEK, TT saponins attenuate UVB-induced programmed cell death through inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) TT saponins do not make the malignant keratinocytes more resistant to UVB and determine an enhanced apoptotic response. The photoprotective effect of TT saponins is tightly correlated to the enhancement of NER genes expression and the block of UVB-mediated NF-κB activation. Collectively, our study shows experimental evidence that TT has a preventive efficacy against UVB-induced carcinogenesis and the molecular knowledge on the mechanisms through which TT saponins regulate cell death suggests great potential for TT to be developed into a new medicine for cancer patien...|$|E
