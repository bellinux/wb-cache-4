25|$|A {{number of}} sources point to the misuse of {{hydroelectric}} dams {{as a cause of}} the floods. Hydroelectric plants in the dams of Tabasco share the production of electricity with newer, private, more expensive gas plants. Investors complained that government owned plants cover most of the production of the electricity, lowering the price, and have put pressure on the government to lessen production on hydroelectric plants {{in order for them to}} sell more energy and raise their profit levels. This allegedly led to the dams retaining more water than <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

The Hanthawaddy forces led by Upayaza, the heir-apparent and Gen. Talaban defeated the Konbaung armies led by Alaungpaya's sons Naungdawgyi and Hsinbyushin at Myingyan. One Hanthawaddy army chased Hsinbyushin to Ava, and laid siege to the city. Another army chased Naungdawgyi's army, advancing as far as Kyaukmyaung a few miles from Shwebo, where Alaungpaya was residing. The Hanthawaddy flotilla had complete control of the entire Irrawaddy River.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} quirk in this {{alternating}} pattern when Edward VIII became king in January 1936 and was portrayed facing left, the same as his predecessor George V. This was because Edward thought his left to be his best side. However, Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 and his coins were never put into general circulation. When George VI came to the throne, he had his coins struck with him facing the left, as if Edward VIII's coins had faced right (as <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> according to tradition). Thus, in a timeline of circulating British coins, George V and VI's coins both feature left-facing portraits, although they follow directly chronologically.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to judge him by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (cf. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates says he will not use sophistic {{language}} — carefully arranged ornate words and phrases — but will speak using the common idiom of the Greek language. He affirms that he will speak in the manner he is heard using in the agora and at the money tables. Despite his claim of ignorance, Socrates speaks masterfully, correcting the Orators and showing them what <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> — speak the truth persuasively and with wisdom. Although offered the opportunity to appease the prejudices of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. Accordingly, the jury condemns Socrates to death.|$|E

500|$|It {{soon became}} obvious that, like Jourdan's {{force in the}} north, the Army of Rhine and Moselle was isolated, too far extended, and must retreat. In {{the first half of}} September, in Bavaria, Latour's 16,960 men hounded Moreau's army in a drive to the east, Fröhlich's 10,906 {{soldiers}} pushed from the south, Nauendorf's 5,815 men to the north and Petrasch's 5,564 troops continued their push to the west. On 18 September, Petrasch and 5,000 Austrians briefly captured the fortified bridgehead at Kehl before being driven out by Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg's counterattack. Each side suffered 2,000 killed, wounded and captured. Instead of burning the bridge, though, as <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> Petrasch's men instead plundered the French camp and lost the opportunity to trap Schauenburg's army on {{the west bank of the}} Rhine.|$|E
500|$|Opinions varied {{about the}} effect Libertarian nominee Dan Feliciano's {{candidacy}} had on the result. Former Governor Douglas suggested that Feliciano split the anti-Shumlin vote. The Burlington Free Press speculated that Feliciano drew voters dissatisfied with Shumlin but who would have voted for Milne if they had {{realized that he had}} a chance to prevail. Feliciano stated that he was [...] "not a spoiler" [...] but drew voters who could not bring themselves to vote for the Republican candidate. A Feliciano campaign consultant felt, based on polling, that her candidate's stance against Shumlin's healthcare policy garnered votes. Milne, who did no polling, began criticizing Shumlin's healthcare policy later in the campaign than Feliciano. Republicans wondered whether <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more to push Feliciano out, whether Milne should have run more strongly against single-payer, whether 2012 nominee and former State Auditor Randy Brock should have run again, and whether the state party should have been less focused on state legislative races.|$|E

500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> Thompson instead ordered {{one of the}} British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among the many things taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, but the fact is, that the French are good at plunder").|$|E
