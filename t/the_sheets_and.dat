500|$|J.R. {{explains}} to Jock and Bobby that Ewing Oil is doing fine, leaving Bobby suspicious. J.R. had swindled {{most of the}} other oilmen that he knows to salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization. Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide {{as a result of the}} dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization. The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone, whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil. Marilee's calls to J.R. are refused. Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution. All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings. [...] The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information. J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. [...] Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor/boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information. [...] Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from between <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells. Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R.'s secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. [...] Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her. He is not worried. She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful. When he leaves for another woman she gets upset, but finds a gun lying around, which gives her pause.|$|E
2500|$|Tyndale's New Testament {{had been}} {{published}} in 1526. The complete Bible was put out under the pseudonym of Thomas Matthew in 1537; it was printed in Paris and Antwerp by Adriana's uncle, Sir Jacobus van Meteren. Richard Grafton published <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> got leave to sell the edition (1500 copies) in England. At the insistence of Archbishop Cranmer, the [...] "King's most gracious license" [...] was granted to this translation. Previously in the same year, the 1537 reprint of the Myles Coverdale's translation had been granted such a licence.|$|E

6000|$|... 'My {{husband is}} dead,' {{answered}} she, {{pointing to the}} bed; and the chamberlain drew back <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> beheld Abu Nowas lying stiff and motionless. Then he gently replaced <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> returned to <b>the</b> palace.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Westmacott {{produced}} a large registered envelope from beneath <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> tossed {{it over to}} the old seaman.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Jones;--"excuse me, sir, I'll {{take a look}} at <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> braces and {{see that}} all's fast--be back in a few minutes." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{knapsack}} and the kitchenino {{were dropped}} on the repulsive floor, which I hated to touch with my boots even. I turned back <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> looked at other people's stains.|$|E

60|$|She {{gave it to}} him, and he {{scribbled}} hastily, {{and then}} tore off <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> handed it to Brown.|$|R
60|$|We {{children}} were not greatly interested in <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> tablecloths and pillow-cases which now {{came out of the}} capacious depths of the old blue chest. But Aunt Olivia was quite enraptured over them.|$|E
60|$|Charlie Brooke, being {{a strong}} believer in strict discipline, at once ran {{to obey the}} order, {{accompanied}} by the most active among the men, while others ran to slack off <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> lower the topsails.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I won't, granny, if I {{can help}} it,' he replied; 'but {{it is enough}} to make a fellow swear, it is so awfully hot.' He gave another great lunge, and made <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> {{blankets}} all untidy again.|$|E
60|$|The foreman, without answering, {{scribbled}} {{press on}} a corner of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> made a sign to a typesetter. He handed <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> silently over <b>the</b> dirty glass screen.|$|R
40|$|Processes and apparati for shaping {{sheet glass}} or {{thermoplastic}} materials use force from {{a layer of}} a flowing fluid, such as air, between <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> a mandrel at close to the softening temperature of the thermoplastic. The shape is preserved by cooling. The shape of the air bearing mandrel and the pressure distribution of the fluid contribute to the final shape. A process can be conducted {{on one or two}} surfaces such that the force from the air layer is on one or two surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>The</b> gap size between <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> mandrel determines <b>the</b> pressure profile in the gap, which also determines <b>the</b> final <b>sheet</b> shape. In general, smaller gaps lead to larger viscous forces. The pressure profile depends on the shape of the mandrel, the size of the fluid gap <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fluid supply pressure...|$|R
6000|$|I hesitated. 'No, no doubts,' I answered, {{turning over}} <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> {{inspecting}} it still closer. 'I type-wrote it at Florence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ease off <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> {{square the}} topsail yards," [...] {{was at that}} moment said, or rather murmured, by a bass voice so deep and rich, that, {{although}} scarcely raised above a whisper, it was distinctly heard over the whole deck.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} the house women {{streaked}} and dressed the corpse. Then came Finnward, and carried <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> curtains from the house, and caused build a fire upon the sands. But Aud had {{an eye on her}} man's doings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rummy how alike our writing looks," [...] said Dunstable, {{collecting}} <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> examining them. [...] "You {{can hardly}} tell {{which is which}} even when you know. Well, there goes three. My watch is slow, as it always is. I'll go and get that note." ...|$|E

60|$|Then Tom {{ran off to}} {{the galley}} and {{obtained}} a box full of pepper. The pepper was sprinkled over <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bolster.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's a {{very big}} house, and I've been, I think, into every room since I have been here, and I've moved most of the {{furniture}} in the drawing-rooms with my own hand, and I've counted the pounds of butter, and inspected <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> tablecloths." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{replied with}} a curious smile that I could have any of them. Amazed, I yet {{selected}} a state-room, and while the steward was gone for <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> pillow-cases, I occupied my time by opening the doors {{of all the other}} state-rooms. They were empty.|$|E
6000|$|She found Mrs. Tuke wildly {{clutching}} {{the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>sheets,</b> <b>and</b> crying: [...] "No, Tommy dear. I'm awfully fond of you, you know I am. But go away. Oh God, go away. And put a space between us. Put a space between us!" [...] she almost shrieked.|$|E
60|$|Rose {{looked at}} the lines of knights and ladies winding down the yellow {{broadside}} of <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>and</b> wondered if she would ever see them.|$|R
50|$|The {{lateen sail}} {{can also be}} tacked by {{loosening}} the yard upper brace, tightening the lower brace until the yard is in vertical position, and twisting the yard {{on the other side}} of the mast by a tack. Another way of tacking with a lateen sail is to loosen the braces, lift the yard vertical, detach <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> tack, and turn the sail {{on the other side of}} the mast in front of the mast, <b>and</b> reattach <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> tack. This method is described in Björn Landström's The Ship.|$|R

60|$|The {{men whose}} duty {{it was to}} trim the sails ran to <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> braces. The Madras swept up into the wind, and, as her sails drew on the other tack, she came along on a course that would take her within a hundred yards of the brig.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{put them}} up this morning," [...] the old man said, nodding. [...] "I have got <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> bedding airing in the kitchen. They have not {{been out of the}} press for the last three years. You can cook in the kitchen. There is always a fire there.|$|E
60|$|I {{folded up}} <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> maps, and {{placing them in}} an oilskin case, tied them round my body under my waistcoat.

60|$|The boys {{looked at}} <b>the</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>and</b> read <b>the</b> names of Walter D. Flood and Andrew W. Crossley, two juniors, whom they knew by sight only.|$|R

40|$|An in-situ {{measurement}} {{approach for}} three-dimensional deformation of <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> tools during stamping using borescopes was developed. The borescope, {{consisting of a}} small CCD camera with a flexible cable, was connected to personal computer and placed inside a small space between the tool cavities to measure the deforming behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>The</b> deformation behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> punch, <b>the</b> real springback and wrinkling in shrink flanging were measured. The deformed shape of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> measured by <b>the</b> borescope was in good agreement with that measured by the laser displacement sensor. In addition, three-dimensional deforming behaviour was measured by a stereoscopic method using two borescopes. It {{was found that the}} borescopes are effective in in-situ measurement of three-dimensional deformation behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> tools...|$|R
