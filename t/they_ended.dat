5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider {{attention with}} the wartime columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide.

5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars.

He signed Celtic's Colin Douglas for the challenge of Third Division football, but otherwise remained loyal to his promotion squad for the approaching 1981–82 season. Another strong September, six wins seeing the club rise to second in the table, won Bremner the Third Division Manager of the Month award. However a lean spell would follow, and from November to February Doncaster failed to win in the league.
