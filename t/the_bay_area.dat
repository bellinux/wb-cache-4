5|$|Politics in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most liberal in California and in the United States. Since the late 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> cemented its role as the most liberal region in California politics, supporting the center left Democratic Party's candidates for U.S. President and continued to support Democratic candidates more than other regions of the state, even as California trended towards the Democratic Party over time. According to research by the Public Policy Institute of California, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> and the North Coast counties of Humboldt and Mendocino were the most consistently and strongly liberal areas in California.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since antiquity, {{first by the}} Ohlone and Miwok peoples, followed by the Spanish, who first arrived in 1769 and established the area's first mission, Mission San Francisco de Asís, in 1776. After being ceded to the United States in 1848, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> grew immensely due to the California Gold Rush, establishing itself {{as one of the}} most important regions on the West Coast. Today, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> is the home of Silicon Valley, Wine Country, and numerous companies, universities, bridges, airports, and parks.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} of human settlements in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{dates back to}} 3000 BC. In 1769, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portolà entered the Bay – the first documented European visit to <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area.</b> After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821, the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States seized the territory in 1846 during the Mexican–American War. Soon after, discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers, many using ports in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> as an entry point. During {{the early years of}} California's statehood, state legislative business rotated between three locations in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento. A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906, but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition. During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{played a major role in}} America's war effort in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, with San Francisco's Fort Mason acting as a primary embarkation point for American forces. In 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco, establishing the United Nations, and in 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco officially ended the U.S.'s war with Japan. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> has experienced numerous political, cultural and artistic movements, developing unique local genres in music and art and establishing itself as a hotbed of progressive politics. Economically, the post-war Bay Area saw huge growth in the financial and technology industries, creating a vibrant and diverse economy with a gross domestic product of over $700 billion, and home to the second highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the United States.|$|E

I-205 also serves to connect <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> with popular weekend destinations such as Yosemite, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. The Altamont Commuter Express provides commuters with an alternate route over Altamont Pass to San Jose and San Francisco, the latter through a transfer to BART.|$|E

5|$|Despite its urban character, the San Francisco Bay {{is one of}} California's most ecologically {{important}} habitats, providing key {{ecosystem services}} such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers, and supporting a number of endangered species. The region is also known for the complexity of its landforms, the result {{of millions of years}} of tectonic plate movements. Because <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> is crossed by six major earthquake faults, the region is particularly exposed to hazards presented by large earthquakes. The climate is temperate and generally very mild, and is ideal for outdoor recreational and athletic activities such as hiking. <b>The</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> is host to seven professional sports teams and is a cultural center for music, theater, and the arts. It is also host to several institutions of higher education, ranging from primary schools to major research universities. Home to 101 municipalities and nine counties, governance in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> is mutlifaceted and involves numerous local and regional actors, each with wide-ranging and overlapping responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Houston Economic Partnership, and <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> today.|$|E
5|$|Even as {{the growth}} of the {{technology}} sector transformed the region's economy, progressive politics continued to guide the region's political environment. By the turn of the millennium, Non-Hispanic whites, the largest ethnic group in the United States, were only half of the population in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> as immigration among minority groups accelerated. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{was the center of the}} LGBT rights movement: in 2004, San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a first in the United States, and four years later, a majority of voters in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> rejected California Proposition 8, which sought to constitutionally restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples but ultimately passed statewide. <b>The</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> was also the center of contentious protests concerning racial and economic inequality. In 2009, an African American man named Oscar Grant was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officers, precipitating widespread protests across the region and even riots in Oakland, and whose name was symbolically tied to the Occupy Oakland protests two years later that sought to fight against social and economic inequality. Following the Inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> became a center of resistance to his administration, beginning with widespread protests in concert with the nationwide Women's March a day later, followed by frequent public feuds between Trump and various Bay Area political, cultural, and business figures over issues of race and immigration, among others.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> {{is home to}} {{a complex}} network of watersheds, marshes, rivers, creeks, reservoirs, and bays that {{predominantly}} drain into the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. The largest bodies of water in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> are the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries. Major rivers of the North Bay include the Napa River, the Petaluma River, the Gualala River, and the Russian River; the former two drain into San Pablo Bay, the latter two into the Pacific Ocean. In the South Bay, the Guadalupe River drains into San Francisco Bay near Alviso.

5|$|Western {{burrowing}} owls {{were originally}} {{listed as a}} species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. A 1992–93 survey reported little to no breeding burrowing owls {{in most of the}} western counties in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area,</b> leaving only Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano counties as remnants of a once large breeding range. Bald eagles were once common in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area,</b> but habitat destruction and thinning of eggs from DDT poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs. Bald eagles disappeared from <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> in 1915, and only began returning in recent years. In the 1980s an effort to re-introduce the species to the area began with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group and the San Francisco Zoo importing birds and eggs from Vancouver Island and northeastern California, and there are now nineteen nesting couples in eight of the Bay Area's nine counties. Other once absent species that have returned to <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> <b>Area</b> include Swainson’s hawk, white tailed kite, and the osprey.|$|E
