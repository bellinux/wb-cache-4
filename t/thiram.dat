50|$|In Brazil, it is {{recommended}} not to plant seed lots with more than 30 percent black point in order to limit spot blotch. Seed treatment {{may prove to be}} appropriate, although the inoculum remaining on secondary hosts or in the soil may reduce the treatment efficiency. Seed treatments with phytoalexin inducer appeared to provide good protection to wheat seedlings against ''''''B. sorokiniana'''''' infection (Hait and Sinha, 1986). Seed treatment with fungicide will help protect germinating seed and seedlings from fungi causing seedling blights. Fungicide seed treatments include: captan, mancozeb, maneb, <b>thiram,</b> pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) or carboxin guazatine plus, iprodione and triadimefon (Stack and McMullen, 1988; Mehta, 1993).

40|$|In this study, the {{relevance}} of photodegradation processes on {{the persistence of the}} fungicide <b>thiram</b> in waters was investigated. The photodegradation of <b>thiram</b> in Milli-Q water and in aqueous solutions of humic and fulvic acids, as well as the photodegradation in spiked river water were studied. Both pure <b>thiram</b> and one of its commercial formulations were used to prepare the solutions which were irradiated in a solar light simulator. In general, <b>thiram</b> photodegradation follows pseudo-first order kinetics. The half-life time of <b>thiram</b> 2 mg L- 1 in Milli-Q water was 28 min. However, the degradation rate of <b>thiram</b> was significantly increased (p = 0. 02) by the inert components of the <b>thiram</b> commercial formulation as well as by commercial humic acids and by fulvic acids isolated from river water (p < 0. 004). Thus, the half-life time of <b>thiram</b> decreased to 24 min {{in the presence of the}} inert formulation components, while, in the presence of both humic and fulvic acids (10 mg L- 1) it decreased to 22 min. Furthermore, <b>thiram</b> photodegradation in natural river water showed that there is a significant enhancement of the degradation rate constant of <b>thiram</b> relatively to Milli-Q water, corresponding to a decrease of about 38 % in its half-life time. This increase of the degradation rate in river water seems to be higher than that observed in the presence of FA, suggesting that beyond organic matter, other natural river components can increase the <b>thiram</b> photodegradation rate. These results allow us to conclude that photodegradation by solar radiation can be an important degradation pathway of <b>thiram</b> in natural waters. HPLC-MS/MS allowed to identify, for the first time, three products of the photodegradation of <b>thiram</b> in aqueous solution. Three compounds were identified and their structure was corroborated by the MSn spectra fragmentation profile. Pathways for the formation of the products from <b>thiram</b> photodegradation are proposed and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|<b>Thiram</b> (bis-(dimethyldithiocarbamoyl) disulfide) is a pesticide, {{widely used}} to protect crops from downy mildew, blight, {{anthracnose}} and cereal smut [48]. The <b>thiram</b> residues {{on the surface of}} foods not only pollute the environment, but also are irritant for the eyes, skin and respiratory tract [49, 50]. It is necessary to evaluate the risk of <b>thiram</b> residues through detection of trace quantities of <b>thiram.</b> Some methods have been used for the determination of <b>thiram,</b> such as chromatography [51], enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [52] and chemiluminescence analysis [53].

LSPR properties of AgNPs influence remarkably the SERS activity, which has be widely investigated by researchers [40, 41]. The higher SERS enhancement would be obtained when the LSPR band of SERS substrate overlaps more with the wavelength of excitation laser during Raman testing. In the present study, the obtained SERS disk (WP-Ag disk) displays a broad LSPR band at a long wavelength (more than 730  nm as shown in Fig.  3 d), due to assembly of silver nanoprisms. Therefore, 785 -nm laser was chosen as excitation light source for SERS test in this work.|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{decrease}} of intracellular glutathione (GSH) was observed when exponentially growing cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{were treated with}} sublethal concentrations of either dimethyldithiocarbamic acid or <b>thiram</b> [bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) disulfide]. The underlying mechanism of this effect possibly involves the intracellular oxidation of dimethyldithiocarbamate anions to <b>thiram,</b> which in turn oxidizes GSH. Overall, a linear relationship was found between <b>thiram</b> concentrations up to 21 microM and production of oxidized GSH (GSSG). Cytochrome c can serve as the final electron acceptor for dimethyldithiocarbamate reoxidation, and it was demonstrated in vitro that NADPH handles the final electron transfer from GSSG to the fungicide by glutathione reductase. These cycling reactions induce transient alterations in the intracellular redox state of several electron carriers and interfere with the respiration of the yeast. <b>Thiram</b> and dimethyldithiocarbamic acid also inactivate yeast glutathione reductase when the fungicide is present within the cells as the disulfide. Hence, whenever the GSH regeneration rate falls below its oxidation rate, the GSH:GSSG molar ratio drops from 45 to 1.

The data suggest also a leading role for the GSH redox cycle in the control of <b>thiram</b> and dimethyldithiocarbamic acid fungitoxicity.

Material and methods: Five years epidemiological cohort study on 132 women occupationally exposed to <b>thiram,</b> in the synthesis industry, were compared to matched controls. Exposure evaluation by GC measurements of <b>thiram</b> in workplaces air and biotoxicological tests, too. Fertility questionnaires were used. The experiment studied <b>thiram</b> effects on fertility as well as genotoxic, embriotoxic and teratogenic potential of <b>thiram</b> in chronic experiments on Wistar female rats by using three doses. Results and discussion: High concentrations of <b>thiram</b> in the workplaces air, and important levels of its metabolite in urine were found. The epidemiological research has showed among the exposed women a significant decrease of the fertility, a higher frequency of spontaneous abortions (OR= 3. 52, 95 % CI: 2. 25 - 5. 50), and a significantly increased risk of congenital malformations (OR= 11. 57, 95 % CI: 2. 13 - 66. 86). The mutagenetic investigations indicated {{a significant increase in}} the number of chromosomal aberrations (p= 0. 004) and of micronuclei (p= 0. 01). In chronic experimental administration, the highest dose (1 / 3 LD 50) determined a significant increase of the tardive resorbtion rate (p= 0. 004) and also a high proportion of major malformations (p= 0. 0001); the medium dose (1 / 9 LD 50) and the low dose (1 / 27 LD 50) generated a high rate of foetal loss. These results are confirmed by high rates of structural chromosomal aberrations and also micronucleus high rates. Conclusions: Epidemiological and experimental studies support the hypothesis that high exposure to <b>thiram</b> determines a significant fertility decrease and the qualitative impairment of offspring...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Thiram</b> a {{fungicide}} {{used for}} treating corn and storing food grains were incorporated at 15, 30 and 60 ppm into the toxin free diet of broiler chicken {{for four weeks}} from the day of hatch. Body weights (g) were recorded at weekly intervals. Average weekly feed consumption (g) and conversion were arrived at. The results showed that feeding <b>thiram</b> caused dose and time related severe depression in the body weight gain. Significant reduction in weight gain was observed from {{the first week in}} 60 ppm level and from second week in 30 ppm level. By fourth week all the <b>thiram</b> fed birds showed significant reduction in the weight gain...|$|E
