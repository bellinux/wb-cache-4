It {{is the purpose of}} this thesis to {{investigate}} differences between p-values depending on the choice of classes in the case of Poisson distribution. Samples from Poisson distribution of various sizes are simulated. For all choices of classes which satisfy condition of minimal theoretical frequency p-value is calculated. The simulations are made for various minimal <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The unknown parameter is estimated both by modified method of minimum chi-squared and by sample mean. The simulations show that the condition of minimal theoretical frequency of classes is not sufficient and the tests are unreliable. Therefore the rule of almost equal <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequencies</b> in all classes is added and in the further simulation a substantial improvement of the test is shown when this condition is satisfied.

40|$|Active pipe-embedded {{building}} envelope {{is a new}} {{building envelope}}, which is an external wall or roof with pipes embedded in it. This structure has the advantages to utilize directly low-grade energy sources for reducing building cooling/heating load and improving indoor thermal comfort. This structure may also use some phase change materials (PCM) to be pasted as a thin layer for further enhancing these benefits. This paper presents a dynamic simplified thermal model of this structure with the thermal network structure of lumped thermal mass, and the parameter identification of the simplified model based on frequency characteristic analysis. These resistances and capacitances are identified in frequency domain by using generic algorithm (GA) by comparing the frequency characteristics of the simplified model with the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequency</b> characteristics of this structure obtained with Frequency-Domain Finite Difference (FDFD) method. Firstly, the FDFD model of this structure is established, and the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequency</b> characteristics under various disturbances are calculated for the reference of parameter identification. Then, an equivalent dynamic simplified thermal model with lump thermal network structure is developed, and its frequency characteristics are also deduced and calculated. Finally, GA estimator is used to identify these parameters of the simplified model for allowing the frequency responses of the simplified model to match the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequency</b> responses by using FDFD method.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a vibration-based automated framework dealing with local faults occurring on bearings in the transmission of a helicopter. The knowledge of the shaft speed and kinematic computation provide <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequencies</b> that reveal deteriorations on the inner and outer races, on the rolling elements or on the cage. In practice, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequencies</b> of bearing faults may be shifted. They may also be masked by parasitical frequencies because the numerous noisy vibrations and the complexity of the transmission mechanics make the signal spectrum very profuse. Consequently, detection methods based on the monitoring of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequencies</b> may lead to wrong decisions. In order to deal with this drawback, we propose to readjust the fault frequencies from the <b>theoretical</b> <b>frequencies</b> using the redundancy introduced by the harmonics. The proposed method provides the confidence index of the readjusted frequency. Minor variations in shaft speed may induce random jitters. The change of the contact surface or of the transmission path brings also a random component in amplitude and phase. These random components in the signal destroy spectral localization of frequencies and thus hide the fault occurrence in the spectrum. Under the hypothesis that these random signals can be modeled as cyclostationary signals, the envelope spectrum can reveal that hidden patterns. In order to provide an indicator estimating fault severity, statistics are proposed. They make the hypothesis that the harmonics at the readjusted frequency are corrupted with an additive normally distributed noise. In this case, the statistics computed from the spectra are chi-square distributed and a signal-to-noise indicator is proposed. The algorithms are then tested with data from two test benches and from flight conditions. The bearing type and the radial load are the main differences between the experiences on the benches. The fault is mainly visible in the spectrum for the radially constrained bearing and only visible in the envelope spectrum for the "load-free" bearing. Concerning results in flight conditions, frequency readjustment demonstrates good performances when applied on the spectrum, showing that a fully automated bearing decision procedure is applicable for operational helicopter monitoring...|$|E
