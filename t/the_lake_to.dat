5|$|The Harvey Lake and Towanda Branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad was {{constructed}} in the late 1800s. It ran directly from Wilkes-Barre to Harveys Lake. In the 1890s, railroad lines were constructed from <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> the communities of Pittston and Towanda.|$|E
5|$|The road {{begins to}} climb again {{over the next}} few miles, passing a county park and finally the small Mount Peter ski area before {{crossing}} the Appalachian Trail along the ridgecrest of Bellvale Mountain. From here it once again drops down and bends in a northsouth direction to reach Greenwood Lake, where NY210 leaves to go along the side of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> the state line.|$|E
5|$|Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby feed {{a stream}} that is {{believed}} to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes the creation of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged the labor of surrounding villagers to dig the lake {{at the site of}} the spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing zebu at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> inaugurate it.|$|E

5|$|A story {{tells of}} a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into the lake and was {{astonished}} {{to see that the}} Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.|$|E
5|$|Additional realignments were {{completed}} by the MSHD to move US2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet. From there east, it was numbered just M‑48, removing US2 from a concurrency. Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M‑117. The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>to</b> take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E

5|$|At Tupper Lake, {{the route}} serves {{a cluster of}} {{recreational}} buildings at its intersection with Warren Point Road, a private drive leading to Warren Point. Here, NY421 turns southward, running along the lake shore to nearby Paradise Point Road, which leads east to Paradise Point and the lakeside Veterans' Mountain Camp. After Paradise Point Road, the highway follows a winding, southeasterly course along Tupper Lake, passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth. NY421 follows <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> its southern tip, where the route ends at an intersection with NY30 {{just west of the}} St. LawrenceFranklin county line.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe {{is shown to}} be similar to the Clans, yet follows a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E
5|$|During {{the end of}} 2008, Lake Banook had its canoe course {{upgraded}} by Dexter Construction Limited. Water {{that had}} been pumped out of lake ceased on 15 December 2008, allowing <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> rise back to its regular level by February 2009. Cleanup, restoration and landscaping was completed {{in the spring of}} 2009. By May 2009, this construction included new concrete abutments at the , , , and finish points, debris and abutment cleanup, ten new lane wires, four new cross wires, and 800 new buoys. Starting gates were tested during the second national team trials held at the lake on 27–28 June 2009. Temporary grandstands for 20,000 spectators per day were also constructed.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> the east. The route {{gradually}} descends {{back into the}} valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming. Once in Fleming, NY38 runs along the lakeshore and serves {{a long line of}} lakeside homes as it passes by a series of fields to the west. The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m). This {{generated}} a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted {{to the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> explore the remains. The upper part of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.|$|E
5|$|NY210 commences at the New York–New Jersey {{state line}} {{in the town of}} Warwick, where it connects to CR511 in Passaic County, New Jersey. Like CR511 in New Jersey, NY210 is the primary lakeside roadway along Greenwood Lake, an interstate lake located roughly equally in New Jersey and New York. NY210 heads north from the state line along {{the western edge of the}} base of a deep valley {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> a community known as Indian Park, entirely situated on the steep incline leading away from the lake. The route continues on to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake, located at the northern tip of the lake.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lakes</b> <b>to</b> Locks Passage is {{a scenic}} byway in northeastern New York in the United States and in {{southern}} Quebec in Canada. The byway unifies the interconnected waterway {{of the upper}} Hudson River, Champlain Canal, Lake George, and Lake Champlain; this waterway {{is the core of}} North America’s first [...] "super-highway" [...] between upstate New York and the Canadian province of Quebec. The initiatives of <b>the</b> <b>Lakes</b> <b>to</b> Locks Passage aim to unify the byway corridor as a single destination. The US portion of the passage is a New York State Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway, and an All-American Road.|$|R
5|$|Past Duck Pond, {{the route}} {{turned to the}} southeast, passing {{by a series of}} small ponds and {{crossing}} under an old railroad grade as it ran along the base of a series of peaks known as the Loon Lake Mountains. NY99 continued to follow the range to the northwestern edge of Loon Lake, where it veered to the northeast and ran along the northern and eastern shores of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> the hamlet of Loon Lake at its southeastern tip. NY99 passed generally northwest–southeast through the small lakeside community before reentering another sparsely developed area of the town of Franklin. The highway progressed southeastward, crossing over the northern branch of the Saranac River and passing through the largely undeveloped community of Merrillsville before ending at an intersection with NY3.|$|E
5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced seismicity. Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E
5|$|Six weeks later, Trent (Travis Van Winkle), {{his girlfriend}} Jenna (Danielle Panabaker), and friends Chelsea (Willa Ford), Bree (Julianna Guill), Chewie (Aaron Yoo), Nolan (Ryan Hansen), and Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta) arrive at Trent's summer cabin {{on the shore}} of Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Whitney's brother Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) arrives at <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> search for her. Clay visits Trent's cabin, and Jenna agrees to help him search for Whitney. As they search, Jason kills Chelsea and Nolan while they are wakeboarding on the lake. Clay and Jenna search the old Crystal Lake campgrounds where they see Jason hauling a body into the {{abandoned}} camp house.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> {{continued}} <b>to</b> aggrade (an {{increase in}} land elevation, {{in this case}} of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> bed, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deposition of sediment) during the 19th century.

25|$|<b>The</b> Great <b>Lakes</b> {{are today}} {{used as a}} major water {{transport}} corridor for bulk goods. <b>The</b> Great <b>Lakes</b> Waterway connects all the lakes; the smaller Saint Lawrence Seaway connects <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic oceans.

5|$|The Itzas' {{continued}} resistance {{had become}} a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all. Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of Lake Petén Itzá with his soldiers on 26 February 1697, and once there built the heavily armed galeota attack boat. The galeota carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces. The piragua longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> {{be used in the}} attack on the Itza capital.|$|E
5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>to</b> minimise pollution.|$|E
5|$|Cornell {{lobbied for}} the {{establishment}} of the South Parks and Boulevard System. The first bond vote was rejected in 1867, as just a method to provide remote driving grounds for rich citizens and to lure people to move away for the benefit of real estate speculators and developers. In 1869, the bills were passed by the legislature, and the South Park Commission was formed with support from Cornell. The future site was primarily under Lake Michigan or abutting the Illinois Central Railroad right of way. In 1892, the formerly trestled railroad was raised on an embankment, along the present west edge of the park. South Park (the present Jackson Park) was slowly developed, and along with the Midway Plaisance and Washington Park, the designs by Frederick Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were focused on lagoons and navigation from <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> <b>to</b> South Park Way (now King Dr.) and 55th Street, in addition {{to the development of a}} country driving park, horse and buggy paths along the lake, and a water system running north to downtown. By the 1880s, the development included the Kenwood and Bowen communities, and by the 1890s, immigrant neighborhoods were developing. The city limits were expanded from 39th to 130th in 1889, absorbing virtually all of Hyde Park Township (35th to 138th).|$|E
