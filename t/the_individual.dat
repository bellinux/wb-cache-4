40|$|The {{steering}} mechanism of fish schools was analysed {{by using an}} analytical model and computer simulation. The analytical model is based on fundamental behavioural rules such as attraction, parallel-orientation, and repulsion.

The results show that when the school advances, unstable movements by <b>the</b> front <b>individuals</b> cause a change in the moving direction of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> that follow that <b>individual.</b> <b>The</b> transmission of the change in moving direction of <b>the</b> front <b>individuals</b> to rear individuals depends on how <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> react to <b>the</b> motion of their neighbours.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and understand how individuals in adulthood experienced a childhood with neglect, and how they handled neglect. In order to reach the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> who grew up with neglect, we chose to use autobiographical books as our empirical material. The criteria the autobiographies had to meet in order to fall within the scope of this study was that the biographies had to display the experience of neglect during childhood, and thereto the books had to be written by individuals who themselves experienced neglect. Based on the {{aim of this}} study we sought answers to three questions: How do <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> describe their upbringing with a mentally or socially disabled parent? How have <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> coped with <b>the</b> neglect they’ve been exposed to? What consequences have the neglect supposedly led to? The findings of this study show that the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> experienced neglect were profound and comprising. Most prominent in the material was physical and mental abuse. For survival <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> used different strategies to master the different situations they were subjected to. <b>The</b> strategies <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> described were most often used to provide food, confirmation and to keep emotions in check. Furthermore <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> described that <b>the</b> neglect and abuse led to various consequences, some that were prominent during childhood others not until <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> reached adulthood. ...|$|R
