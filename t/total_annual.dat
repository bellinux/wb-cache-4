40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} of the land cover distributions, land cover changes and the differences in ecosystem service provisions resulting from distinctive indicators based on various CORINE land cover classes. By analyzing the land cover dynamics and the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Carbon Storage (CS), and a qualitative indicator derived from the ecosystem service matrix method (GCR), this study measures the land cover distributions. The land-cover-based global climate regulation potential is assessed to improve global climate regulation. This study uses spatial and statistical analysis tools referring to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the statistical package R and the software of SPSS are used to estimate the land cover and ecosystem services dynamics in Schleswig-Holstein. The study has found that “non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” are the dominating land cover classes in Schleswig-Holstein, and the significant land cover changes are among them. “Non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” have higher <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP values than the other land cover classes. Geest has the largest <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP even though the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP and NPP are less than the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP and NPP in Marsch. Simultaneously, Dithmarschen and Rendsburg-Eckernförde hold larger <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP amounts than the other districts. The outcome of the comparison of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the global climate regulation service, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> NPP, SOC, Carbon Stocks and GCR is that all of them show significant correlations. The interrelations among the different indicators, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> NPP, and the statistical data of average harvest, the harvests of grain, green corn, root crops and winter rape evaluated based on districts also correlate significantly...|$|R

40|$|District {{heating systems}} have the {{potential}} to contribute to the UK renewable energy targets. However, {{there are a number of}} economic barriers which would have to be addressed in order to make district heating competitive in comparison with alternative heating technologies. The objective of this research was to model and analyse a district heating network and develop an optimisation method to calculate the minimum capital investment, heat losses and pump energy consumption. Firstly, modelling and analysis of a district heating network was conducted to obtain district heating design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption and annualised cost. Then through the analysis, a two-stage programming model was developed which synthesised design and optimal operation of a district heating network. The optimisation was used to minimise <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption or annualised cost of the heat network by selecting suitable pump and pipe sizes, taking into account different parameters such as target pressure loss, temperature regime and operating strategy. The optimisation technique was used to investigate two different case studies, with high and low heat density. In all cases, a variable flow and variable supply temperature operating method was found to be beneficial. Design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption and annualised cost used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. To achieve the minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption a design case with larger pipe diameters and smaller pressure loss was found to be desirable. It was observed that by reducing the water temperature and increasing temperature difference between supply and return pipes, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption and the annualised cost were reduced. It was also shown that district heating in an area with high heat density is more energy efficient and cost effective...|$|R
5|$|After {{years of}} failed {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} {{is one of}} the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries, comprising around a tenth of the <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> catch. Its significance is likely underestimated, as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data. It is mainly caught during summer and fall, being the most common ray landed in Bahía Magdalena, and second most common ray landed off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines, with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bahía Magdalena catch in 19982000. This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. In the future, habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms may pose an additional threat to this species in the region. As a result of these pressures, the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species.|$|E

The first chapter was released for purchase {{in the summer of}} 2008 on digital video stores, such as iTunes Store and Amazon Video on Demand. DC Direct released action figures based on the film in January 2009. Director Zack Snyder also set up a YouTube contest petitioning Watchmen fans to create faux commercials of products made by the fictional Veidt Enterprises. The producers also released two short video pieces online, which were intended to be viral videos designed as fictional backstory pieces, with one being a 1970 newscast marking the 10th anniversary of the public appearance of Dr. Manhattan. The other was a short propaganda film promoting the Keene Act of 1977, which made it illegal to be a superhero without government support. An official viral marketing web site, The New Frontiersman, is named after the tabloid magazine featured in the graphic novel, and contains teasers styled as declassified documents. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> print run expected to be over one million copies.

5|$|In October 2005, Gordon and Levin {{met with}} Warner Bros. {{to develop the}} film there again. Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on 300, Warner Bros. {{approached}} him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen. Screenwriter Alex Tse drew from his favorite elements of Hayter's script, but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic. Similar to his approach to 300, Snyder used the comic book panel-grid as a storyboard and opted to shoot the entire film using live-action sets instead of green screens. He extended the fight scenes, and added a subplot about energy resources to make the film more topical. Although he intended to stay faithful to {{the look of the}} characters in the comic, Snyder intended Nite Owl to look scarier, and made Ozymandias' armor into a parody of the rubber muscle suits from the 1997 superhero film Batman & Robin. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> print run expected to be over one million copies. While 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit to block the film's release, the studios eventually settled, with Warner agreeing to give Fox 8.5 percent of the film's worldwide gross, including from sequels and spin-offs in return. The film was released to theaters in March 2009.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} evaporation {{which can lead}} to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter.

There has been {{an increase in the number}} of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation).
