What is noticeable, however—earlier <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality {{at the very center}} of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.|$|E
