2500|$|In [...] "Taking Fidelity Philosophically" [...] (in Difference in Translation), Johnson {{describes}} translation as an ultimately impossible endeavor {{because the}} [...] "mother" [...] or original language is already, intrinsically untranslatable from signifier <b>to</b> <b>signified.</b> The more one attempts to translate a work into comprehensibility, {{the more likely}} one is to stray from its original ambiguity. [...] Jacques Derrida, with his thoughts on différance, elucidates the complicating but necessary fact of language: that it is foreign to itself. Every attempt to translate sets the language against itself, creating new tensions as it progresses. Translation, though impossible, is also necessary, as it is precisely these tensions that constitute language.|$|R

5|$|Animal supporters, {{standing}} {{on either side}} of the shield to hold and guard it, first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. Originally, they were not regarded as an integral part of arms, and were subject to frequent change. Various animals were sporadically shown supporting the Royal Arms of England, but it was only with the reign of Edward IV that their use became consistent. Supporters fell under the regulation of the Kings of Arms in the Tudor period. The heralds of that time also prochronistically created supporters for earlier monarchs, and although these attributed supporters were never used by the monarchs concerned, they were later used <b>to</b> <b>signify</b> them on public buildings or monuments completed after their deaths, for instance at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor Castle.|$|E
