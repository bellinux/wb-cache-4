500|$|Wise called The Haunting {{one of his}} top ten {{or twelve}} {{favorites}} among the films he made, commenting that it was his favorite filmmaking experience. Ettington Park, (now the Ettington Park Hotel), with its grounds near the village of Ettington, Warwickshire, was used for exterior shots of Hill House. According to actor Russ Tamblyn, Wise approached a society that kept track of British haunted houses, and they gave him a list of such places. [...] Production designer Elliot Scott was sent around the country <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> house, and Wise personally selected Ettington Park. [...] Some of the cast and crew were housed in Ettington Park during exterior shooting. However, the [...] location did not sit well with Harris and Bloom who upon arriving at Ettington Park thought it was [...] "scary looking outside", and Wise had to reassure them. Interior sets were constructed and shot at the MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The interior sets were designed by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as a [...] "major contributor" [...] to The Haunting. The sets were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style. All rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Actor Richard Johnson said that the sets created a subdued feeling among the cast and crew.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{elected to}} push on and record 1997's Aftertaste as a three-piece. A {{first version of}} the album was {{withdrawn}} at last minute {{in the fall of}} 1996 when promotional activities had already begun. Eventually, release was delayed to March 1997 for a new audio mix, and the guitarist Chris Traynor (formerly of Orange 9mm) was recruited for the supporting tour. Although the song [...] "Exactly What You Wanted" [...] became a moderate radio hit, the album spent only a few weeks on the Billboard 200 and has sold 135,000 copies as of April 2006. The Aftertaste Tour in 1997–98 would prove to be the band's last. Amid long-standing private disputes, the members decided to call it quits. Asked about the breakup, Hamilton replied, [...] "9 years, 1,600 shows, 5 albums, and we found it hard <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other anymore" ...|$|E

5000|$|... 17 October. It is {{dark and}} crowded on the streets. It is terrible <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. <b>Each</b> coming day brings blood. The Bolsheviks forge their {{uprising}} and we await it obediently like a force of fate.|$|R

60|$|In {{the winter}} {{they could not}} do this, but then they put hot pennies against the frozen window-panes, and made round holes <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other through.|$|E
6000|$|The mate flushed darkly. [...] "I don’t {{know much}} about such things," [...] he said at length; [...] "but we’ll have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, and {{all that sort of}} thing, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|To Rex {{at twenty}} {{the joy of}} life seemed at an end more {{absolutely}} than it can do to a man at forty. But before they had ceased <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, he did speak again.|$|E
60|$|In {{any other}} place, the {{appearance}} of the wretched, jaded, spiritless object would have occasioned a murmur of compassion and remonstrance. It had some effect, even there; for the lookers-on moved uneasily in their seats; {{and a few of the}} boldest ventured <b>to</b> steal <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, expressive of indignation and pity.|$|R
60|$|Brice's heart leaped! If he had {{forgotten}} her in the excitement of his interview, he atoned for it by a vivid blush. Her own color was a little heightened as she slipped into the room, but the two managed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> demurely <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, without a word of recognition.|$|R
30|$|Time-frequency image {{watermarking}} {{methods can}} be classified in two traditional approaches: spatial and spectral domain techniques. In the spatial domain, the watermark is embedded in selected regions chosen based on {{the texture of the}} given T-F image. In the spectral domain, the watermark is embedded in the transform domain using methods such as discrete cosine transform (DCT) and DWT, in the mid-frequency range to ensure transparency and robustness of the watermark. A joint TFD of images can give a more comprehensive representation of the image compared <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> domain individually [67, 70]. Image watermarking in the T-F domain can be done using the basic WVD [68]. In this method, the watermarked cells are selected based on their impact on image quality as well as resilience to JPEG.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{object to}} that {{question}} as contrary to law," [...] put in Ithuel, with a spirit and promptitude that caused the Judge Advocate to start, {{and the members of}} the court <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other in surprise.|$|E
60|$|Half an hour later, as, resting {{from their}} daily labours, Hague Simon and his consort Meg were seated at their evening meal, a knock {{came at the}} door, causing them to drop their knives and <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other suspiciously.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the different dimensions of child poverty in Indonesia, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> child outcomes and opportunities across consumption, health, education, housing, food security, social assistance and infrastructure. In addition <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of these measures, we go further {{to investigate the}} associations between them, asking {{whether it is the}} same children who are poor on each dimension or different ones. For example, we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the associations between physical access to education, health and transportation services; and consumption, housing, water and sanitation; whether money poor and food poor children are the same; the linkages between access to health services and social assistance and health outcomes; and associations between barriers to enrolment. These associations have important implications for program design and targeting. We present results over time, as well as for different populations of interest, such as rural, urban and female-headed households...|$|R
6000|$|For {{more than}} an hour after this he was so {{absolutely}} still that Bianca rose continually <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. <b>Each</b> time, his eyes, wide open, were fixed on a little dark mark across the ceiling; his face had a look of the most singular determination, as though his spirit were slowly, relentlessly, regaining mastery over his fevered body. He spoke suddenly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, then, {{you have}} a price?" [...] I did not restore the {{precious}} thing; not from any vindictive purpose but because I instinctively clung <b>to</b> it. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other hard while I retained it.|$|R
60|$|As {{the party}} slowly wended {{its way toward}} the colonel's cabin Jim and Nell found {{themselves}} side by side. They had not exchanged a word since the evening previous, when Jim had kissed her.

6000|$|So Alice hunted {{among the}} chessmen {{on the table}} till she had found the Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the Queen <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other.

40|$|Professor Greenawalt 2 ̆ 7 s {{perceptive}} Essay raises {{at least}} four issues: {{the issue of what}} he calls modernization, the issue of standards of interpretation, the distinction between discourse within the law and public debate over social values, and the question of the compatibility of hermeneutics and natural law. I would like <b>to</b> <b>look</b> briefly <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of these issues in turn...|$|R
5000|$|After {{a federal}} trial court {{rejected}} a racial gerrymandering claim regarding statehouse districts, the United States Supreme Court vacated and remanded. [...] The five justice majority found “there is strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor”. Because {{the trial court}} had wrongly looked for racial gerrymandering at the statewide level the Supreme Court ordered the trial court <b>to</b> instead <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> district individually.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, poor Miss Mowbray," [...] said Lady Penelope, {{lowering}} her voice, {{and shaking}} her head; [...] "she has not appeared--her brother went up stairs {{a few minutes}} since, I believe, to bring her down, {{and so we are}} all left here <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other.--How very awkward!--But you know Clara Mowbray." ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{before the}} first tremulous shock the doctor had been {{explaining}} {{to the prime minister}} the nature of volcanoes, and stating his opinion that the cup-like hollow before them was an extinct crater. The slight shock stopped him in his discourse, and caused the party <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other with serious faces.|$|E
60|$|He cantered away. We tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other's faces, and at Bill's {{expression}} in the darkness, but he neither spoke nor stirred until he threw down the reins when we stopped before the station. The passengers quickly descended from the roof; the Expressman was about to follow, but Bill plucked his sleeve.|$|E
60|$|Miss Townshead {{gave him}} back the message, but Deringham {{did not see}} her face, for she and his {{daughter}} seemed <b>to</b> be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other. They formed a somewhat curious contrast, for Alice Deringham appeared taller and more stately than {{she was in her}} costly furs, and Nellie Townshead very slight and almost shabby in her thin and well-worn dress. Neither spoke for a moment, but the half-amiable condescension in Miss Deringham's attitude was a trifle too marked.|$|R
60|$|And so Alaric and Gertrude were whisked away, and {{the wedding}} guests were left <b>to</b> <b>look</b> sheepish <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, and take {{themselves}} off {{as best they}} might. Sir Gregory, of course, had important public business which precluded him from having the gratification of prolonging his stay at Hampton. Charley got away in perfect time to enjoy whatever there might be to be enjoyed at the dancing saloon of Seville, and Undy Scott returned to his club.|$|R
6000|$|Then Paul and {{his father}} went out, leaving the two owners <b>to</b> stand <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other {{as if they were}} {{uncertain}} as to their own identity. It was some moments before they spoke after they were alone, and then Johnny went near the door and stood on his head, in a grave, business-like manner, until his face was as red as a boiled beet. After this feat had been accomplished he appeared to feel considerably relieved, and he said, as he went close up to Ben, ...|$|R
60|$|The two blacks {{looked at}} Tier earnestly; then {{they turned their}} heads <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other. The idea struck each as bold and novel, but each saw serious {{difficulties}} in it. At length Josh, as became his superior station, took on himself the office of expressing the objections that occurred to his mind.|$|E
60|$|At dinner, however, she did {{not feel}} exalted, but merely uncomfortable, as if she and Richard had seen {{something}} together which is hidden in ordinary life, so {{that they did not}} like <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other. Richard slid his eyes over her uneasily once, and never looked at her again. Formal platitudes were manufactured with effort, but Willoughby was kindled.|$|E
60|$|The same {{shouts and}} the same struggles were his only answer. But the man darting in at the peril of his own life, saved Montague's, by {{dragging}} him through the mire and {{water out of the}} reach of present harm. That done, he ran to Jonas; and with the aid of his knife they very shortly disengaged the horses from the broken chariot, and got them, cut and bleeding, on their legs again. The postillion and Jonas had now leisure <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, which they had not had yet.|$|E
5000|$|Dizzy Grizzlies are {{a variant}} of Teddy Grahams, and are so called because they would [...] "become dizzy" [...] due <b>to</b> the snacker <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> side again and again, as the {{backside}} is covered with chocolate and sprinkles.

60|$|Turning {{again to}} the foaming sea the young banker {{proceeded}} slowly along the shore some distance, when he observed {{the body of a}} man being rolled up on the sand and dragged back by each returning wave. Rushing forward he caught it, and, with the aid of the fishermen, carried it {{beyond the reach of the}} hungry waves. But these waves had already done their worst. Dalton applied the proper means for restoration, but without success, and again the fishermen began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> gravely <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other and shake their heads.|$|R
