5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E
5|$|The {{denominations}} in the Latter Day Saint {{movement are}} sometimes collectively {{referred to as}} Mormonism. Although some denominations opposed {{the use of this}} term because they consider it to be derogatory, it is especially used when referring to the largest Latter Day Saint group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and offshoots of it. Denominations opposed to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> consider it to be connected to the polygamy once practiced by the Utah church.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{electricity}} and <b>the</b> claim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon being non-lethal, controversy has sprouted over particular incidents involving <b>the</b> weapon and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon in general. In essence, controversy has been centered on <b>the</b> justification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon in certain instances, and, in some cases, health {{issues that are}} claimed {{to be due to}} <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon.|$|R

5|$|The second-largest {{denomination}} is the Community of Christ (first {{named the}} Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) from 1872 to 2001), a Missouri-based, 250,000-member denomination. Though {{members of this}} church have traditionally been called Latter Day Saints (without the hyphen), the Community of Christ has more recently stated that it rejects <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Saints as a designation for its members in any official reference or publication.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> bhakti, meaning devotion, is not {{confined}} to any one deity. However, Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, particularly among the Vaishnava sects. Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the concept of lila, meaning 'divine play', as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions {{prohibit the}} use of the phrase kosher in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.|$|E
5|$|It was de Jussieu in 1789 {{who first}} {{formally}} created a 'family' (Narcissi), as the seventh 'Ordo' (Order) {{of the third}} class (Stamina epigyna) of Monocots in which Narcissus and 15 other genera were placed. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Ordo {{at that time was}} closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. The family has undergone much reorganisation since then, but in 1805 it was renamed after a different genus in the family, Amaryllis, as 'Amaryllideae' by Jaume St.-Hilaire and has retained that association since. Jaume St.-Hilaire divided the family into two unnamed sections and recognised five species of Narcissus, omitting N. serotinus.|$|E
5|$|The region, {{as defined}} above, has a total {{population}} of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as Macedonian {{on a national level}}, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both Macedonian on a regional, and Greek on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led {{to a wide variety of}} terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.|$|E

50|$|Educational sloyd {{as practiced}} in Sweden started with <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife. The knife was {{controversial}} when sloyd {{was first introduced}} in the UK. Educators in London and <b>the</b> other cities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK could hardly imagine putting knives in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> juveniles. They developed a rationale for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> chisels instead. Salomon's purpose in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife was that it illustrates a fundamental premise. During <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> sloyd’s invention and introduction in rural Sweden, nearly every boy growing {{up on a farm}} was already experienced in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife and knew how to use it without endangering himself or others. Starting with the known and moving toward the unknown was a crucial element of Salomon’s theory.

5|$|On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war {{strategy}} rarely involved massive invasions; {{more often}} it employed small scale {{methods such as}} attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire {{was among the first}} in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.|$|E
