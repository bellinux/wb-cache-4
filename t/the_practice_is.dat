5|$|The Hindu {{practice}} of appearing before {{the people at}} the jharokha was started by Humayun, though <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> generally credited to Akbar. Humayun had fixed a drum beneath the wall so that the petitioners assembled below the jharokha could beat it to draw his attention.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|A {{slightly}} variant way of executing {{people by}} means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person's ribs and hang him up to die slowly. This technique was in 18th century Ottoman-controlled Bosnia called the cengela, but <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> also attested, for example, in 1770s Dutch Suriname as a punishment meted out to rebellious slaves.|$|E
25|$|In the Fall of 2007, when {{complaints}} were made that dipping the flag toward a religious altar was inappropriate, then-academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Jeffrey Fowler directed that <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>be</b> discontinued.

50|$|Vodka eyeballing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{practice}}</b> of pouring vodka {{through the}} eye socket. Reports of this practice as a new fad surfaced in the media beginning in 2010, as hundreds of clips of persons purporting to engage in <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>were</b> posted on YouTube. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> condemned by <b>the</b> American Academy of Ophthalmology.|$|R
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect {{is often more}} difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|An avid hunter, Booth {{posted a}} YouTube video in May 2012 of him baiting and killing an American black bear. Though <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> legal in Alberta, it is banned in 18 American states, {{as well as}} British Columbia, the Vancouver Canucks' province. Booth's actions were widely criticized among the public causing him to remove the video within days.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>practice</b> {{of burning}} widows {{has not been}} {{restricted}} to the Indian subcontinent; at Bali, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> called masatia and, apparently, restricted to the burning of royal widows. Although the Dutch colonial authorities had banned <b>the</b> <b>practice,</b> one such occasion is attested as late as in 1903, probably for the last time. In Nepal, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> not banned until 1920.|$|R

5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external female genitalia. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, {{legislation}} or corporate practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men.|$|E
5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
50|$|Other {{terms for}} <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>are</b> pre-partying, prinking and (in Europe) prefunking.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> {{rooted in}} gender inequality, {{attempts}} to control women's sexuality, and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who {{see it as a}} source of honour, and who fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion. Health effects depend on the procedure. They can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, chronic pain, the development of cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.|$|E
5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} cohabitation) {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% in countries such as Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{has held}} many titles and honorary {{military}} positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders {{in her own}} countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When in conversation with the Queen, <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. <b>The</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E
50|$|Dahomey had banned <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> of panyarring in {{the early}} 17th century under King Houegbadja, {{requiring}} that all debt disputes be handled in royal courts.

Although <b>the</b> kingdom was known for its militarism and slave raids, Dahomey did not use panyarring and <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> not prominent along what {{was known as the}} Slave Coast in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R

5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E
