40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{resonator}} structure {{with a high}} Q factor, which {{has the potential to}} replace the Quartz crystal. In order to achieve a higher Q, complete decoupling of the resonating structure from the supporting ends is desired. One of the ways of achieving this is to distribute the stress uniformly throughout the support beam rather than their being concentrated at the fixed ends. This suggests a resonating mass supported by torsion wires. Here, three resonating structures are connected in a serial fashion. The outer two resonators act as interfaces to the external oscillator circuit, while the centre one is fully decoupled. The losses at the end of torsion wires are thus kept to lowest value. The other losses, namely damping and internal friction losses, are kept to a minimum by providing vacuum and using high quality material for the <b>torsion</b> <b>wire.</b> Modal analysis and static stress analysis were done on the structures and results clearly show the fundamental torsion mode of vibration and extremely small stresses at the fixed ends of the <b>torsion</b> <b>wire...</b>|$|E

40|$|A new {{torsion balance}} for study of {{adhesion}} in ceramics is discussed. A <b>torsion</b> <b>wire</b> and a linear variable differential transformer {{are used to}} monitor load and to measure pull-off force (adhesion force). The investigation suggests that this torsion balance is valuable in studying the interfacial properties of ceramics in controlled environments such as in ultrahigh vacuum. The pull-off forces measured in dry, moist, and saturated nitrogen atmosphere demonstrate that the adhesion of silicon nitride contacts remains low at humidities below 80 percent but rises rapidly above that. The adhesion at saturation is 10 times or more greater than that below 80 percent relative humidity. The adhesion in a saturated atmosphere arises primarily from the surface tension effects of a thin film of water adsorbed on the surface. The surface tension of the water film was 58 x 10 to the minus 5 to 65 x 10 to the minus 5 power. The accepted value for water is 72. 7 x 10 to the minus 5 power N/cm.

40|$|Abstract. Commercially pure Al wires {{are drawn}} through equal channel angular dies with {{simultaneous}} <b>torsion.</b> The <b>wires</b> are deformed {{up to an}} equivalent strain of 1 to 4 at room temperature after several passes. The microstructure evolution of the wires is investigated using optical microscopy at both longitudinal and transverse cross sections. A grain refinement to a mean grain size of 10 to 15 µm is achieved by using this process. Finer grain structure is observed at the edge area of the wires due to the non-uniform strain distribution. The micro-hardness measurement indicates that the hardness distribution is inhomogeneous and increasing from a minimum value at the wire centre to a maximum value at the wire edge. Finite element (FE) results show that by using a channel angel of 160 ° and an initial wire diameter of 4 mm during one pass, an equivalent plastic strain of about 0. 4 at the wire centre and 0. 9 at the wire edge can be achieved. The most important advantage {{of this process is}} the ability to impose continuous severe plastic deformation to wires. This new hybrid process could be used as an industrial method for continuous grain refinement of wires...|$|R
40|$|A non-local {{theory of}} {{plasticity}} that incorporates effects of incompatibility of plastic (or elastic) strains {{has been developed}} in this study. An intrinsic length scale arises in the constitutive equations {{as a consequence of}} the notion that hardening depends not only on plastic strain but also on the incompatibility of plastic deformation. In particular, hardening is taken to depend on a first order gradient of plastic strain. A simple theory is proposed which does not involve higher-order stresses as in the Fleck-Hutchinson (1997) theory. The resulting boundary value problems of incremental equilibrium introduced from the simple incompatibility theory, as we will refer to it for brevity, belong to the class of problems analyzed by Hill (1958, 1959, 1978). In this work the setting of infinitesimal strains has been assumed for the most part. Given the algebraic nature of the flow rules with respect to incremental quantities, no extra boundary conditions beyond the conventional ones are required for the solution of the incremental problem of equilibrium. This simplifying feature is absent in other non-local theories of inelasticity. ^ This incompatibility theory provides a simple way to predict the length scale effect in the case where high strain gradients are present. Two problems of interest involving size effects are considered: <b>torsion</b> of thin <b>wires</b> and biaxial stressing of a thin film on a rigid substrate. In the former problem, our numerical simulation provides very good agreement with the experiments of Fleck et al. (1994). The result also suggests the intrinsic length scale should be on the order of microns consistent with the scale that enters the more complicated Fleck-Hutchinson theory. The thin film predictions are similar to experiments of Doerner et al. (1986) showing that thinner films support higher stresses. In conclusion, the incompatibility theory provides a new way to predict the size effects in thin <b>wire</b> <b>torsion</b> and deformation of thin film. ...|$|R
