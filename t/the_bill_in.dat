5|$|In late July, {{during the}} height of the debt ceiling crisis, McCotter {{canceled}} several appearances in Iowa and returned to Washington. He supported the plan of House Speaker John Boehner, and voted in favor of the compromise bill.

When Jim Kelly joined <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>in</b> 1986, Metzelaars became a {{productive}} part of the offense.

5|$|Sections 9A(3)(b) and 9A(3)(c) of the Interpretation Act {{contemplate}} {{the use of}} explanatory statements to a tabled bill or a speech made by a minister {{on the occasion of}} the motion for the second reading of the bill as interpretive aids. However, they do not permit reference to other explanatory statements or speeches. The statements the court may refer to under these provisions are strictly the statements concerning <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> question.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis is territorial, {{defending}} the nesting and display sites against intruders. Agonistic or threat displays include lunging forward with <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> a horizontal posture, and standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird {{engaging in the}} same display. Birds also lunge and bite, often holding onto an opponent's head or wings.|$|E
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau agent {{wrote to}} Congressman William Kelley of Pennsylvania {{requesting}} {{the removal of}} Johnston's disabilities because of his charity.

5|$|The House of Representatives easily passed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> {{just seven}} days. The most {{contentious}} issue was {{the inclusion of}} Section 7(a), which protected collective bargaining rights for unions.

5|$|The Speaker of Parliament is {{required}} to refer all bills, with some exceptions, to the PCMR for consideration immediately after the third reading of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> Parliament and obtain the Council's report on it before the bill may {{be sent to the}} President for assent.|$|E
5|$|Trudie Goodwin played PC, later {{promoted}} to Sergeant, June Ackland from 1983 to 2007, appearing first in Woodentop.

5|$|Two of {{the more}} recent {{successful}} campaigns to name a state dog have been started by schoolchildren. In 2007, Alaskan kindergarten student Paige Hill's idea created the campaign for the Alaskan Malamute which would convince Representative Berta Gardner to support <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> 2009, with it becoming law in 2010. Elementary school students from Bedford, New Hampshire won their campaign for the Chinook to be accepted {{as a symbol of}} their state in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} {{of civil rights}} groups began a court challenge of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the State Supreme Court decision in the case of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E
5|$|Five years later—with the First World War {{raging in}} Europe—the {{political}} climate had changed. A tentative five-year program {{put together in}} October and supported by President Woodrow Wilson called for ten battleships, six battlecruisers and ten destroyers {{to be completed by}} 1922. This was submitted to Congress in December 1915. On 2 June 1916, the House of Representatives passed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> a modified form, replacing five of the battleships with battlecruisers. On 29 August 1916, the Senate also passed an altered bill, keeping the original number of ships but stipulating that the program be completed in three years (FY 1917–19). The first four ships were paid for in FY 1917, the fifth in FY 1918, and the last in FY 1919.|$|E

5|$|In August 2006, Union Cabinet of India assented to {{the demands}} of the Uttaranchal state {{assembly}} and leading members of the Uttarakhand statehood movement to rename Uttaranchal state as Uttarakhand. Legislation to that effect was passed by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly in October 2006, and the Union Cabinet brought in <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the winter session of Parliament. The bill was passed by Parliament and signed into law by then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam in December 2006, and since January 1, 2007 the state has been known as Uttarakhand.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Royal assent is {{sometimes}} associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted {{at a ceremony}} held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> <b>In</b> Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament {{of his or her}} agreement to the bill.|$|E

50|$|After his collegiate {{career at}} the University of Tennessee, Bryson was drafted by <b>the</b> Buffalo <b>Bills</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third round with the 86th overall pick of the 1999 NFL Draft.

After the 2006 season, Bryson did not play with another NFL team.|$|R
5|$|The {{detention}} {{order on the}} ITAK leaders was lifted in October 1961. As a compromise the Bandaranaike government proposed the District Councils Bill to devolve powers to districts but following protests from Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists dropped <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> June 1964. In 1964, as ITAK started preparing for a second civil disobedience campaign, the government started collapsing. As several SLFP MPs defected to the opposition, the government sough ITAK's support but ITAK chose instead to support the opposition and on 3 December 1964 the government was unable to prove its majority in parliament, precipitating an election.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E
