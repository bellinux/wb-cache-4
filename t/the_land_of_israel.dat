The rainy season starts just after the fall Jewish holidays. Because of that, and because the sukkah (and, by extension, pleasant weather) is no longer required on Shemini Atzeret, Jews begin to ask for rain starting with the Musaf amidah prayer of Shemini Atzeret. This prayer is recited in a traditional, distinctive, plaintive melody during the cantor's repetition of the amidah. In most Ashkenazi synagogues, the cantor is clad in a white kittel, a symbol of piety, owing to the vitality of a positive judgment for rain. A brief mention of rain continues to be inserted in the amidah until Passover. The Yizkor memorial service is also recited in Ashkenazi synagogues on this day.|$|R

25|$|When Israel {{was founded}} in 1948, the {{majority}} Labor leadership, which governed for three decades after independence, accepted the partition of the previous British Mandate of Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states as a pragmatic solution to the political and demographic issues of the territory, with <b>the</b> description <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> applying to <b>the</b> territory of the State <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> within the Green Line. The then opposition revisionists, who evolved into today's Likud party, however, regarded <b>the</b> rightful <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> as Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema (literally, <b>the</b> whole <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel),</b> which came {{to be referred to}} as Greater Israel. Joel Greenberg, writing in The New York Times relates subsequent events this way:The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought his party to power {{for the first time in}} a stunning election victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, Mr. Begin had preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (<b>the</b> West Bank <b>lands)</b> and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office, reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn Israel it into a binational state instead of a Jewish one.|$|R
