5|$|<b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commissioners was not binding, and {{the rivalry}} between {{supporters}} of the two routes intensified. An independent Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was proposed, to build from Carlisle to meet the GPK, and the GPK itself proposed several branches, mostly for tactical reasons, to weaken or exclude the Caledonian Railway (CR), as the dominant supporter of the Annandale route. Of these only an extension from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh, south of the mining town of Old Cumnock was authorised, by Act of 21 July 1845. The CR case was strengthened by its intended branch to Edinburgh; moreover locomotive designs were being improved, {{and the capacity to}} haul trains over the steep gradients of the Annandale route was diminishing in importance. In Parliamentary hearings in 1845, the Caledonian Railway passed the Commons and despite the GPK fighting on in the Lords, the Caledonian Railway was authorised, in preference to the Nithsdale route, on 31 July 1845.|$|E
