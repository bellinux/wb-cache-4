Many species feed in small groups, often in mixed-species foraging flocks. The hook-billed vanga and Lafresnaye's vanga tend to forage alone. Vangas {{have a variety}} of different foraging strategies. Many species glean food as they move <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>branches.</b> The nuthatch vanga climbs up trunks and branches like a nuthatch but does not climb downwards as nuthatches do. Crossley's babbler forages by walking along the forest floor amongst the leaf litter. The chabert vanga and the tylas vanga often fly into the air to catch prey. The three Xenopirostris vangas use their laterally flattened bills to strip bark off trees to search for food underneath.|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, The Talking Teapot and Other Tales, was {{published}} in 1934, {{the same year as}} the first book in her Brer Rabbit series, Brer Rabbit Retold; (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, Adventures of the Wishing-Chair, followed in 1937. The Enchanted Wood, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from [...] "thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree.

Vibe magazine's Hyun Kim argued that its songs drew focus to her singing {{more than her}} previous records, [...] "bringing it to the forefront as opposed to hiding it behind the layered production". [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] was sung with breathless vocals by Aaliyah, who instructed her lover on how to please her sexually and equated her erotic high to a drug high. Ballads such as [...] "I Care 4 U", [...] "Never No More", and [...] "I Refuse" [...] were sung more emotively, expressing melancholy qualities and hurt. On [...] "I Can Be", Aaliyah sang {{from the perspective of}} an adulterous man's mistress who wanted to be his foremost girlfriend. Alex Macpherson from The Guardian wrote that [...] "Aaliyah's blank, numbed delivery" [...] on the song [...] "makes being the other woman seem like an emotionally masochistic form of self-medication". Biographer Christopher John Farley said she [...] "emotionally detailed a song" [...] unlike on her previous albums and that [...] "her gentle voice now seemed like something elemental, a kindly wind blowing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> of a big tree." [...] According to Joshua Clover, Aaliyah pushed musical notes [...] "into strange corners of syncopation's shifty architecture" [...] on the more [...] "shape-defying" [...] tracks. He wrote that [...] "she makes the sonics tell the story, creating meaning outside the lyrics, pleasure beyond the hooks." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPatient {{specific}} geometrical data {{on human}} coronary arteries can be reliably obtained multislice computer tomography (MSCT) imaging. MSCT cannot provide hemodynamic variables, and <b>the</b> outflow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> side <b>branches</b> must be estimated. The impact {{of two different}} models to determine flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> side <b>branches</b> on <b>the</b> wall shear stress (WSS) distribution in patient specific geometries is evaluated. Murray's law predicts that <b>the</b> flow ratio <b>through</b> <b>the</b> side <b>branches</b> scales with <b>the</b> ratio of the diameter of <b>the</b> side <b>branches</b> to <b>the</b> third power. The empirical model is based on flow measurements performed by Doriot et al. (2000) in angiographically normal coronary arteries. The fit based on these measurements showed that <b>the</b> flow ratio <b>through</b> <b>the</b> side <b>branches</b> {{can best be described}} with a power of 2. 27. The experimental data imply that Murray's law underestimates <b>the</b> flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> side <b>branches.</b> We applied <b>the</b> two models to study the WSS distribution in 6 coronary artery trees. Under steady flow conditions, the average WSS between <b>the</b> side <b>branches</b> differed significantly for the two models: the average WSS was 8 % higher for Murray's law and the relative difference ranged from − 5 % to + 27 %. These differences scale with the difference in flow rate. Near the bifurcations, the differences in WSS were more pronounced: the size of the low WSS regions was significantly larger when applying the empirical model (13 %), ranging from − 12 % to + 68 %. Predicting outflow based on Murray's law underestimates <b>the</b> flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> side <b>branches.</b> Especially near side <b>branches,</b> <b>the</b> regions where atherosclerotic plaques preferentially develop, the differences are significant and application of Murray's law underestimates the size of the low WSS region...|$|R
