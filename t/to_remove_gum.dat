Crantz {{that belongs}} to Brassicaceae family has been grown as a {{dicotyledonous}} oilseed crop in the cold places like America and Canada. Camelina seeds are widely used for the extraction of oil and protein. Recently, research found that camelina gum is an excellent candidate for food and industrial uses as thickener or stabilizer. The objectives of this research were 1) to increase camelina gum isolation efficiency using spray drying technology, and 2) to develop an innovative method <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>gum</b> from seed bran to increase protein and oil extraction efficiency and quality. The camelina gums isolated using ethanol precipitation and spray drying method from the whole camelina seeds were compared. Effects of spray drying temperature on yield, gum morphology, and gum rheological and thermal properties were studied. The representative sample dried at 165 °C was chosen to {{study the effects of}} concentration, temperature, pH and additives (NaCl, CaCl 2, sucrose, and ethanol) on viscosity and viscoelastic properties of the isolated gum. The gum showed a shear thinning behavior when shear rate increased gradually, higher concentrations of additives only slightly affect the rheological properties. Results showed that spray drying is an effective method in terms of saving time and energy, and provided positive rheology benefits on camelina gum isolation. Pre-removal of gum from camelina seeds can increase protein and oil yield and their quality. Decortication can separate 10 - 17 % of the total camelina seed as bran. A wind tunnel was used to separate lighter bran particles from heavier endosperm and unbroken seeds. Camelina gum isolation from the separated seed bran using the traditional ethanol precipitation method was optimized using response surface methodology where the simultaneous effect of the three independent variables (seed bran to water ratio, isolation temperature, and isolation time) were investigated for gum yield, purity, and optimum rheological properties. Three independent quadratic modules were developed and the original data fitted the models fitted (R 2 = 0. 995, 0. 877, and 0. 804). The optimal isolation conditions were seed bran to water ratio of 1 : 39, isolation temperature of 35 ºC, and isolation time of 1. 5 h and 0. 839 desirability was obtained by the rigorous statistics analysis. The protein yield and quality extracted from decorticated endosperm were improved significantly compared with that extracted from whole seeds meal without decortication. In addition, the degumming step can be eliminated before protein and oil extraction that increase protein and oil extraction efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Gingivectomy, a {{surgical}} gum treatment used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>gum</b> tissue, is {{applied for a}} variety of reasons, including the removal of diseased gum tissue and gum contouring for aesthetic purposes. While a scalpel has been previously used in this procedure, laser gingivectomy is now becoming common due to its decreased invasiveness, minimal bleeding, and quicker healing time. However, an entirely new set of considerations must be addressed with the introduction of lasers to the procedure. Since laser gingivectomy is essentially heat treatment, the heat from the laser can damage surrounding tissue and teeth. Therefore, the intensity of the laser beam must be carefully selected to prevent significant damage of teeth or non-targeted gum tissue above the incision line. A feature that helps preserve healthy tissue is the pulsed application of the laser, which prevents the exposure of the tissue to heat flux over an extended amount of time. Therefore, our goal was to model a laser gingivectomy process that may be used to identify the ideal laser power and pulse rate for gingivectomy that minimizes collateral tissue damage. To accomplish this, we created a 2 D cross-sectional model in COMSOL of the middle of a maxillary incisor with an overextending gum. The COMSOL computer software allowed us to simulate the effects of laser contouring on the gum-tooth complex. Gum geometry was simplified to a slab of constant thickness {{across the top of the}} incisor, meeting the tooth at a rounded edge. Tooth geometry was simplified to a series of rectangular slabs exhibiting constant thickness consistent with parameters gleaned from literature. Preliminary results showed little heat penetration to the extremes of our computational domain, which supports the simplification of not including the entire length of the tooth in our geometry. Material properties, such as the thermal conductivity, density, and heat capacity of gum and tooth were taken from existing literature. We considered targeted gum to be vaporized at a temperature of 100 ˚C, consistent with surface soft tissue heat treatment characteristics. Ideally, tooth and preserved gum should stay below 60 ˚C. The tooth temperature profile is considered in an optimization equation that aims to minimize unnecessary tissue damage. This temperature profile is used to determine which regions are suffering protein denaturation and experiencing vaporization. By comparing our results with previously conducted procedures involving laser treatment of gum, we found that our results were consistent with the outcomes of these processes, which used the same type of laser as the one we modeled. Noting that the simplifications and conjectures on boundary and initial conditions limit the validity of our model, our results indicated that the ideal laser peak power for a gingivectomy process using a CO 2 laser is 25 Watts. Our model could also be used to test the use of gingivectomy to dispose of diseased tissue, which likely exhibits different material properties than the healthy gum tissue we modeled. Therefore, our model can provide laser manufacturers and product trainers with crucial information that can be used to develop parameter settings for a more controlled gingivectomy. In this study, we model the ablation of the gum tissue and find the optimal power of the laser and pulse conditions in order to successfully ablate the tissue without causing unnecessary heat damage to the healthy tissue or the enamel of the tooth...|$|E

40|$|In the United States, as per ASTM standards, pure {{biodiesel}} (B 100) {{is considered}} to be an alternative fuel under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Biodiesel refers to a diesel-equivalent, processed fuel derived from biological sources (such as vegetable oils), which can be used in unmodified diesel-engine vehicles. In recent years, biodiesel fuels have received significant attention both as a possible renewable alternative fuel and as an additive to existing petroleum-based fuels. Besides just an additional fuel supply, biodiesel exhibits several advantages when compared to existing petroleum fuel.;The state of Iowa and Iowa State University through the Iowa Energy Center sponsors research regarding alternate energy and efficiency. The Iowa Energy Centers 2 ̆ 7 Biomass Energy Conversion (BECON) facility in Nevada, Iowa houses the state 2 ̆ 7 s most innovative and collaborative biomass conversion projects for developing new fuels and chemicals from biomass and enhancing existing processes. The biodiesel pilot plant at BECON is one of such projects. The pilot plant evolved slowly from producing biodiesel at a laboratory scale with fats and oils to pilot scale production in batches. Efforts were made to make this a continuous process starting from preparing feedstock to final production of biodiesel. The work represented by this thesis was undertaken in order to get one step closer to the goal of making a continuous process.;Crude soybean oil contains impurities that can be classified into two categories: oil insoluble and oil soluble. The oil insoluble impurities consists of seed fragments and meal fines, free water and long chain hydrocarbons or waxes. Most of these materials can be removed by filtration. The oil-soluble materials include free fatty acids, phosphatides, gummy or mucilaginous substances and some other compounds. Phosphatides in soybean oil are most commonly referred to as 2 ̆ 7 gums 2 ̆ 7. Currently, at BECON the soybean oil produced from the soybean processing plant was stored in a tank and the gums (mainly phosphatides) were removed by gravity separation by settling in the tank and through filtering. Gravity separation takes a long time <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>gums</b> and it is not very efficient in <b>removing</b> <b>gums</b> because some can not be removed. Therefore, a process capable of separating gums in real time to match with the speed of soybean oil production was needed at the pilot plant. Centrifugal separation of gums is fast and is widely used in the food processing industry. Therefore, centrifugal degumming was chosen and a degumming system was put in place as a tool to demonstrate its use for the biodiesel industry. This thesis will describe the system and main process parameters, which can be varied to get optimum results. Because of time constraint, verifying the effects of all the process parameters on the degumming of oil was {{beyond the scope of this}} project.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Paracetamol is {{currently}} the analgesic / antipyretic which is most commonly used. It is inexpensive, available without prescription and is relatively safe in therapeutic doses. Since toxic effects are so rare, paracetamol is the drug of choice for treating pain and fever in children. The poor water-solubility of paracetamol, {{as well as its}} bitter taste, complicates the formulation of oral paediatric preparations. It has been shown that ethanol increases the risk of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and that its use should be avoided. Various co-solvents were considered as alternative to ethanol for use in aiding the solubility of paracetamol. Six different products were formulated and evaluated. Visual assessment of the samples revealed that only the suspensions stored at 40 °C ± 2 °C / 75 % RH ± 5 % RH underwent a change in appearance. Altered versions of validated HPLC methods were used to determine the paracetamol and 4 -aminophenol content of the six products. The changes to the methods were essential <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> from the test samples, but gave rise to an unavoidable complication during sample preparation. If not removed from the samples, xanthan gum was found to accumulate in the column. The results obtained from the paracetamol assay weren't reproducible and variation between duplicate samples was substantial in many instances. Though no definite conclusion as to the stability regarding paracetamol content can be made without accurate HPLC results, other tests indicate that the products formulated were stable at room temperature. Furthermore, it could not be shown that either halving the conventional paracetamol concentration (2. 4 g / 100 ml), or adding 0. 5 % v/v ethanol to a formulation had any beneficial effects on product stability. Thus, formulating alcohol-free 2. 4 g / 100 ml paracetamol solutions and suspensions can be achieved by using alternative co-solvents in amounts not exceeding their recommended concentrations.
