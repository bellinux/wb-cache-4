5000|$|Despite its 2-D nature, {{graphene}} has 3 acoustic phonon modes. The two in-plane modes (LA, <b>TA)</b> <b>have</b> {{a linear}} dispersion relation, while the {{out of plane}} mode (ZA) has a quadratic dispersion relation. Due to this, the T2 dependent thermal conductivity contribution of the linear modes is dominated at low temperatures by the T1.5 contribution of the out-of-plane mode. Some graphene phonon bands display negative Grüneisen parameters (GPs). At low temperatures (where most optical modes with positive GPs are still not excited) the contribution from the negative GPs will be dominant and thermal expansion coefficient (which is directly proportional to GPs) negative. The lowest negative GPs correspond to the lowest transverse acoustic ZA modes. Phonon frequencies for such modes increase with the in-plane lattice parameter since atoms in the layer upon stretching will be less free {{to move in the}} z direction. This is similar to the behavior of a stretched string that has vibrations of smaller amplitude and higher frequency.

The use of <b>TA</b> <b>has</b> been questioned {{on the basis}} of its potential toxicity. TA's ratio of clinical efficacy to systemic effects compared with oral prednisone has not been clearly defined. We report the case of a prednisone-insensitive severe asthma patient with insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and diabetic retinopathy treated with repeated sessions of laser therapy. By daily monitoring the needs of insulin doses we compared the systemic effects of prednisone and TA. The analysis of the balance between systemic effects (insulin doses) and beneficial effects (PEF values) show that <b>TA</b> <b>has</b> a better benefit/risk profile than prednisone. The patient has been followed up for 3 years and has received injections of TA repeated at intervals ranging from 21 to 60 days according to patient response and the evolution of PEF and clinical symptoms.
