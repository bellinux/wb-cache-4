40|$|Regarding {{offshore}} constructions, {{there is}} still a lack in knowledge of scour progression for complex structures like <b>foundations</b> for <b>offshore</b> wind energy converters at present, which is however necessary for its dimensioning. As an example of such complex structure types, <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> are constructed in German offshore wind farms at present. In order to describe physical processes and influencing factors on scour progression from a scientific point of view, comprehensive investigations on the scouring phenomena for <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> have been carried out and will be partly presented here. The overall investigation method consists of a combination of 1 : 40 small and 1 : 12 large scale physical model tests in wave flumes, numerical simulations using CFD methods and in-situ measured scour data. For the numerical modeling part, a sediment transport model formulation has been implemented into OpenFOAM software code. The results show a general variability of scour depending on the load boundary conditions and structural parameters. Scours occur both at the foundation piles and directly under the structure, which in this form could not be predicted using standard approaches, but which has {{to be taken into account}} when regarding the soil mechanical stability and the final dimensioning of the foundations...|$|R

40|$|As a step {{to further}} develop {{the share of}} {{renewable}} energies, the first German offshore test site alpha ventus has been installed in the North Sea in 2009 in water depths of 30 m, where experience shall be gained and made available for future offshore wind farms. Regarding converter foundations in deep water, {{it is well known}} that in most cases scour phenomena occur around the structures. Due to the complexity of the <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations,</b> significant knowledge gaps in scour progression in general and especially in detail as well as its probable effects on the stability and durability are given. Therefore, investigations on scouring phenomena around complex foundation structures like the tripod are carried out within the research project. The investigation method consists of a unique combination of local scour monitoring as well as physical and numerical modeling, whereas the physical modeling part was carried by means of 1 : 40 laboratory tests and 1 : 12 large-scale physical model tests in wave flumes. The results show that scours around the <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> do not only occur directly around the foundation piles, but also in the near-field of the structure. Compared to first in-situ measured scours in the test site, at least a good qualitative agreement of the modeled scour depths and evolutions could be shown...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate the effects on tower dynamics when mounting a turbine on a monopile <b>foundation</b> <b>offshore</b> compared to a similar onshore installation. Changes in frequency, modeshapes and damping are investigated including effects of hydrodynamics and nonlinear soil properties. The tool used for the investigation is the new aeroelastic code HAWC 2, {{which is based on}} a multibody formulation. The multibody formulation used in the HAWC 2 code is very generally formulated which means that it can handle any structural object (body) as well as large rotations between the bodies and their associated nonlinear effects.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} numerical techniques {{which have}} been developed to analyse three dimensional problems in offshore engineering. In particular, the three dimensional liquefaction analysis of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> on granular soils is the main subject of the thesis. The subject matter is broadly divided into four sections: 1) Development of an efficient method for the three dimensional elasto?plastic finite element analysis of consolidating soil {{through the use of a}} discrete Fourier representation of field quantities. 2) Validation of the three dimensional method through analyses of shallow <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> subjected to three dimensional loading and investigation of the yield locus for foundations on purely cohesive soils. 3) Formulation of governing equations suitable for three dimensional liquefaction analyses of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> founded on granular soil, presentation of a method for liquefaction analyses, and application of the method in modified elastic liquefaction analyses of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations.</b> 4) Application of a conventional elasto?plastic soil model in the liquefaction analyses of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> using the three dimensional finite element method. The finite element method developed in this thesis provides a rigorous and efficient numerical tool for the analysis of geotechnical problems subjected to three dimensional loading. The efficiency of the numerical tool makes it possible to tackle some of the problems in geotechnical engineering which would otherwise need enormous computing time and thus would be impractical. The accuracy of the numerical scheme is demonstrated by solving the bearing capacity problem of shallow foundations subjected to three dimensional loading. The generalized governing equations and the numerical method for liquefaction analyses presented in this thesis provide a solid base for the analysis of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> subjected to cyclic wave loading where they are founded on potentially liquefiable soil. The practicability of the numerical scheme is also demonstrated by a modified elastic liquefaction analysis of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations.</b> The liquefaction phenomenon is redefined in the context of the conventional Mohr?Coulomb model, so that a relatively simple and practical model for elasto?plastic liquefaction analysis is presented. The three dimensional finite element method together with the numerical scheme for liquefaction analysis and the elasto?plastic soil model provide a suitable practical engineering tool for exploring the responses of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> subjected to cyclic wave loading...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with four different types of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations,</b> namely gravity foundations, jack-up foundations, the mudmats for piled jacket structures and caisson foundations for jacket structures. In most applications, these can be idealised as circular rigid foundations. Unlike onshore <b>foundations,</b> <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> are subjected to large horizontal and moment loads. This research used the finite element method to examine the elastic behaviour and stability of circular footings under combined loading. Due to the circular shape of the footings and the combination of vertical, horizontal and moment loads, three dimensional finite element analysis was used. In-depth analyses of the elastic behaviour of circular footings under combined loading (V,H,M) were performed. The vertical stiffness coefficient was investigated using two dimensional axi-symmetric analyses whereas three dimensional analyses were {{used to examine the}} other coefficients. Different features of <b>offshore</b> <b>foundations</b> such as footing embedment and cone angle were taken into consideration. Based on the numerical results, a set of empirical expressions for elastic stiffness coefficient was derived. For footing stability calculations, large horizontal or moment loads can cause the footing to lose contact with the soil, or cause the footing to slide relative to the soil. In finite element analyses, this loss of contact and sliding are modelled by interface elements. A new zero-thickness iso-parametric interface element was formulated for both two and three dimensional analyses. An exact close formed solution for integration of the stress-strain relationship (for the two dimensional interface element) was found. The element is then used to explore footing stability. It was shown that by using a yield criteria which allows the interface to behave as either frictional or cohesive interface, depending upon the normal stress, numerical stability is achieved. The footing stability was examined by establishing the bearing capacity envelope. The envelopes for footings on undrained clays were established for surface flat strip footings and for surface flat circular footings. The effects of soil strength varying with depth, cone angle and embedment on the bearing capacity envelope were also investigated...|$|R

40|$|Marine lifting {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in the installation of turbines and bottom-fixed foundations. Offshroe installations of the bottom-fixed <b>foundations,</b> <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> in this study, are costly and risky due to the challenging environmental conditons and the bulkiness of the object. It becomes more and more challenging due to the tendency to intall larger turbines in the sites further away from shoreline. To minimize the risks and better prepare the operations, careful study and analysis are essential. This thesis addresses numerical studies of the installation of <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> using a heavy lift vessel (HLV). Both frequency and time-domain methods are applied in the study. Investigation is first carried out in the frequency domain using the response aptitude operators (RAOs) of the HLV. The wave induced rigid body motions of the vessel are calculated, represented by response spectrum and spectral moment. Thus, the vertical motion of the crane tip can be predicted, which is used as a criterion to find the limiting weather. As the frequency domain method is based on the simplification of linear response, detailed numerical modelling and simulation of the installation system have been carried out in time domain to analyse the coupled dynamic system. The predicted limiting weather using frequency domain method is firstly verified in time domain by running stationary simulations. It is found that the predicted limiting sea states are inaccurate. The calculated limiting (significant wave height) is underestimated with (spectral peak period of the wave) approaching the natural periods of the installation vessel. During the lifting operations, some potential critical events may be encountered, such as slack wire or re-hit, collision with the lifting vessel due to excessive motions of the tripod. To identify the potential risks, nonstationary simulations are conducted with emphasis on two lifting scenarios, the lift-off and the lowering phases. Moreover, comparative studies in response using two types of installation vessel, the HLV and the Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process. Furthermore, sensitivity study on various hoisting speeds is also performed for the case onboard lift-off. It is found that the wire tension and response of the tripod using the jack-up are relatively smaller, during the lowering process in the selected sea states, than the case utilizing floating vessel. Especially for the lowering in air, huge difference exists between the two types of installation vessels and barely any tripod motion is induced for the jack-up case thanks to the great bottom-fixed stability. Compared to the onboard lift-off, it turns out that there would be much more challenges for the lift-off from barge. Under the considered wave condition, the onboard lift-off operation can be smoothly implemented while the operation from the barge experiences snap load and re-hit...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: As an {{alternative}} to gravity footings or pile <b>foundations,</b> <b>offshore</b> wind turbines at shallow water can be placed on a bucket foundation. The present analysis concerns the de-velopment of consistent lumped-parameter models {{for this type of}} foundation. The aim is to formulate a computationally efficient model that can be applied in aero-elastic codes for fast evaluation of the dynamic structural response of wind turbines. The target solutions, utilised for calibration of the lumped-parameter models, are obtained by a coupled finite-element/boundary-element scheme in the frequency domain, {{and the quality of the}} models are tested in the time and frequency domains. It is found that precise results are achieved by lumped-parameter models with two to four internal degrees of freedom per displacement or rotation of the foundation. Further, coupling between the horizontal sliding and rocking cannot be disregarded without sig-nificant loss of accuracy. Finally, special attention is drawn to the influence of the skirt stiffness, i. e. whether the embedded part of the caisson is rigid or flexible. ...|$|R
40|$|Offshore wind {{industry}} is developing very fast. Transport and installation are important aspects {{for reducing the}} life-cycle cost of offshorewind farms. In shallowwaters (10 - 30 mof water depths), monopile foundations have been widely used, while in deep waters (water depths > 50 m), it is beneficial to use jacket foundations which are transparent to the wave loads. For the water depths in between, the <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> might be considered due to its simplicity as well as high stiffness. This thesis addresses the modelling and dynamic analysis one installation phase for tripods: the lowering into the sea. Due to non-stationarity, current numerical methods used for steadystate conditions are not applicable for simulating the lowering phase. In this thesis, timedomain simulations were performed {{to account for the}} responses of the coupled vessel-tripod system. A systematic methodology to assess the operational limits based on the installation procedure, numerical models and safety criteria was introduced. For the tripod lowering process, the allowable sea states were also established by using the methodology.

40|$|The {{economics}} of {{offshore wind energy}} are (currently) less favorable than for onshore wind energy {{and there is a}} strong need for significant cost reductions in order to become competitive with fossil fuel sources. As about 70 % part of the electricity cost is determined by the initial investment costs, we explored the ranges of possible cost reductions of offshore wind farms until 2020. The investment costs of offshore wind farms mainly consist of the wind turbine, the foundation, internal and external grid-connection and installation costs. For each of these components we analyzed technological developments and cost reduction trends in the offshore wind sector itself, but also in the onshore wind energy sector, the offshore oil and gas sector, and the high-voltage submarine transmission of electricity. Cost reduction trends where either quantified using the experience curve concept, or based on expert judgments. Main drivers for cost reduction appear to be design improvements and upscaling of wind turbines and the development and high utilization rates of purpose-built installation vessels. Other factors are the reduction of steel prices, technological development of HVDC converter stations, standardization of turbine and foundation design, and economies of scale for wind turbine and <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> production. We conclude that under different growth scenarios investment costs of offshore wind farms may decline in the range of 25 - 40 % until 2020...|$|R

This section allows to be outfitted onshore with all functionalities needed in terms of boat landing, cable guiding and last but not least corrosion protection systems. The central column is designed as an open system allowing an unrestricted water exchange in each tide cycle. This circumstance is beneficial when the corrosion protection system has to be designed for the inner surfaces.The Tripod is fixed with midsized pin piles at the sea bed. The piles might be pre piled or post piled. A suction bucket foundation was designed as well. The first tower section, called S3, is foreseen to be mounted offshore on top of the Tripod with a bolted flange connection. This section contains the outer service platform and the entry door. This section is independently accessible for electrical equipment and cold commissioning procedures. Additionally it provides simply height, what can be saved on Tripod side.

After a preloading and jacking procedure, subsea lifts of <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> weighing up to 950 tons as well as tower and nacelle installations at large heights need to be undertaken. As typical offshore wind farms consist of 80 or more separate wind turbines the installation works are conducted in a serial manner- often through the winter season.
