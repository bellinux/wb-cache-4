[...] The Times also gave it all five stars, saying that [...] "the really ingenious element is the Drivatar AI, {{in which the}} computer learns your driving technique." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Car handling is demanding, but beginners can instantly have fun, thanks to helpful driving assists and generous early prizes." [...] However, Jim Schaefer of Detroit Free Press gave it three stars out of four, saying, [...] "man, is this game difficult, even on the easy setting. I prefer games with unreal speed, power boosts and shortcuts.

60|$|The Government {{wanted to}} save the Blacks from {{ultimate}} extermination, if possible. One of its schemes was to capture them and coop them up, on a neighboring island, under guard. Bodies of Whites volunteered for the hunt, for the pay was good--L5 for each Black captured and delivered, but the success achieved was not very satisfactory. The Black was naked, and his body was greased. It was hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> him that would hold. The Whites moved about in armed bodies, and surprised little families of natives, and did make captures; but it was suspected that in these surprises half a dozen natives were killed to one caught--and {{that was not what}} the Government desired.|$|E
6000|$|With a quick {{intake of}} breath he tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> himself. He thought of the battles he had fought with bullies older and bigger than himself, and had won because he had kept {{his head in the}} heat of contest and had coolly taken {{advantage}} of every opening. But that was different. Then he was in action and it was easier to keep cool. Then, too, if he missed one blow there was a chance for another. It was this sitting still with the knowledge that there would be but one chance, and that this must be taken at just the right moment or be lost forever that upset him so. Then curiously enough the motto of the Boy Scouts flashed into his head--"Be prepared." [...] It was like a tonic to his shaking nerves. Was not a Scout supposed to be prepared for all emergencies, and what was this but a form of emergency? ...|$|E

60|$|The fellow {{rose with}} a {{promptness}} which partly disarmed Grant's suspicions, {{and put his}} foot {{on the edge of the}} vehicle, ready to jump down. Then he turned swiftly and flung himself upon the farmer, crushing his soft felt hat down to his chin. Grant could see nothing, and while he strove <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> his antagonist he was thrown violently backward off the driving seat. The wagon was of the usual high pattern, and he came down on the ground with a crash that nearly knocked him unconscious. Before he got up, he was seized firmly and held with his shoulders pressed against the soil. He struggled, however, until somebody grasped his legs and his arms were drawn forcibly apart. It was impossible to see, because the thick hat was still over his face and somebody held it fast, but he had an idea that three or four men had fallen upon him. They had, no doubt, been hidden among the brush; the affair had been carefully arranged with his treacherous companion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the {{preference}} of polyester in a game situation is twofold: firstly, polyester is harder <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hold of in a tackle situation, as it is inherently more 'slippery' than cotton or a cotton-blend. In addition, {{the increasing use of}} skin tight shirts further enhances this effect, as there is no loose material for <b>a</b> tackler <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of.The other benefit of man-made fibre over cotton is that it absorbs less water and mud. As rugby is a sport played mainly in winter and/or bad weather, a cotton rugby kit can weigh around 6 to 8 lb when wet. This extra weight has to be carried by the player, in addition to running in wet, heavy ground.|$|R
50|$|Climbing skins are strips that {{attach to}} the bottom of nordic, alpine touring or randonnée skis to help while {{ascending}} backcountry slopes. They are designed to be removed for skiing downhill. They are typically attached to the skis via a loop on the ski tip, a hook on the tail, and adhesive on the base of the skin. They are called skins because they resemble sealskin, from which the first ski skins were made. They are typically made from nylon or mohair or a combination thereof, and are designed to let the ski slide forward on snow but not backward. They are usually narrower than the ski to allow the ski edges <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip.</b> Some ski resorts permit skinning.|$|R
