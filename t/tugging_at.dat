5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E

5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> the carcass in all directions, and bolting down {{large chunks of}} it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Cheo H. Coker at Rolling Stone called the album Shakur's best {{and said it}} was [...] "by and large a work of pain, anger and burning desperation [...] is the first time 2Pac has taken the conflicting forces <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> his psyche head-on". Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, called Shakur the [...] "St. Augustine of gangster rap" [...] due to his ambivalence towards the behavior and nature of the gangster lifestyle. In a negative review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that Shakur is [...] "witless" [...] when dealing with fundamental hip hop themes of persecution and accused him of [...] "self-pity": [...] "The subtext of his persecution complex is his self-regard". [...] "This may be the first hip-hop blues LP," [...] observed Matt Hall in Select. [...] "Not so much in the music, although the harp blasts owe more to Howlin' Wolf than Tupac's previous two solo efforts, but more with Shakur's vocals, which are at once rebellious and resigned... Me Against the World is a statement of intent, a note from the depths of America, and a fine, thoughtful LP." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{of the few}} {{tangible}} {{reminders of}} the old Sophiatown is the Anglican Church of Christ the King in Ray Street. The architect was Frank Flemming, who designed 85 churches throughout South Africa. The church was constructed in 1933. The bell tower was added in 1936. So little money was made available for the construction that the architect called it a [...] "Holy Barn". The church's distinctive feature was a mural {{that is no longer}} visible. It was painted between 1939 and 1941 by Sister Margaret. The church was an icon of the liberation struggle in South Africa. In 1940 Trevor Huddleston was appointed Rector. He was an outspoken opponent of apartheid. In 1955 during the forced removals, Huddleston was recalled to England. His ashes reside next to his former church. On the north-eastern side of the church there is a mural depicting Huddleston walking the dusty streets of Sophiatown. This mural was painted by 12 apprentice students under patronage of the Gerard Sekoto Foundation. It shows two children <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> his cassock as well as Sekoto's famous yellow houses. The entire Sophiatown community was removed by the end of 1963; the church was deconsecrated in 1964 and sold to the Department of Community Development in 1967. In the 1970s it was bought by the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, which used it for Sunday School. The church changed hands again and the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk bought the building and altered it significantly. The nave was enclosed, a large font was built and wooden panelling and false organ pipes changed the look of the interior. In 1997 the Anglicans bought the church back and it was reconsecrated; the changes were reversed and the building was largely restored to its former self. However, the hall and gallery the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk had built were retained.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, {{the primary}} {{was found to}} have an excess of {{infrared}} emission, implying that it has a circumstellar debris disk. Observations using the Near-Infrared Multi-Object Spectrometer aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 2007 indicated that the dust had a reddish spectrum similar to that of tholins. The disk was resolved with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009, confirming that it exists. Based on these images, the disk has a radius of 75 AU and a width of less than 18.5 AU. It may have some asymmetries and the center appears to be slightly offset from the star. The dust in the disk is likely the result of collisions between larger particles. In 2011, observations of the ring offset by the Subaru Telescope implies that one or more planets would likely exist within gaps <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> its dust grains. With a new image in 2014, the configuration and alignment of the dust ring and HR4796A has been nicknamed [...] "Eye of Sauron".|$|E
2500|$|French refused Haig {{permission}} {{to join in}} an attack by Lanrezac, who wrote of French's [...] "bad humour and cowardice". [...] Even Spears felt Sir John {{was in the wrong}} here. [...] The BEF also did not join in Lanrezac's attack on German Second Army at Guise (29 August). [...] Joffre, who had spent the morning with Lanrezac, was concerned by rumours that the BEF might retreat towards the Channel Ports. [...] He visited French in the afternoon, urging him to hold his place in the line promising that Russian successes would soon allow the Allies to attack. [...] However, French insisted that his forces needed 48 hours of absolute rest, and Murray, whom Joffre noticed had been <b>tugging</b> <b>at</b> French's tunic throughout this, then showed an intelligence report of the strength of the German forces facing the BEF. [...] After Joffre had departed in bad humour, French received an incorrect report that Fifth Army was falling back behind the Oise, and issued orders for the BEF to fall back to Rethondes-Soissons; when he received fresh reports that the French were holding their positions after all he replied that {{it was too late to}} cancel his orders. Sir John's opinion of Lanrezac was so low that he did not believe reports of his success at Guise (29 August) until he had sent Seely to interview the French corps commanders.|$|E
