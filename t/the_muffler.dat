25|$|The early {{single seat}} RX-28 {{suffered}} from a problem of main tube cracking in operational service, due to the close proximity of <b>the</b> <b>muffler</b> heating the tube. This was later resolved by relocating <b>the</b> <b>muffler.</b>|$|E
25|$|A muffler is {{a device}} for {{reducing}} the amount of noise emitted by a machine. On internal combustion engines, the engine exhaust blows out through <b>the</b> <b>muffler.</b> The internal combustion engine muffler was invented by Milton O. Reeves who received a patent in 1897.|$|E
25|$|Gasoline cars became ever {{easier to}} operate {{thanks to the}} {{invention}} of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of <b>the</b> <b>muffler,</b> which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down. By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> new <b>muffler’s</b> noise {{elimination}} frequency {{has been}} derived via a calculation method and FEM method proposed in this study. The size of <b>the</b> <b>muffler’s</b> connection tube was {{selected based on}} {{the diameter of the}} intake tube, and then according to the frequency calculation, we derived the specific optimal geometric dimensions of <b>the</b> cavity resonance <b>muffler.</b>|$|R
3000|$|To {{address the}} problem of low {{frequency}} noise of the internal combustion engine, several existing muffler design methods, such as the theory of the quarter-wavelength tube and <b>the</b> Helmholtz <b>muffler,</b> were examined and compared. This paper proposes a new type of muffler design method, which has the advantages of both the quarter-wavelength tube and <b>the</b> Helmholtz <b>muffler.</b> An example is carried out to illustrate the analysis of original signal, the design of <b>the</b> new <b>muffler</b> and <b>the</b> improvement of the in-car noise. The transmission loss of <b>the</b> new <b>muffler</b> is studied by theoretical method and finite element method. The vehicle test of <b>the</b> new <b>muffler</b> demonstrates excellent performance with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size.|$|R
25|$|DePiro {{became the}} music {{director}} for the USWA/AFL-CIO Constitutional Conventions at age eighteen when he was contracted by Richard Davis, International EVP of the USWA. He then performed at eight USWA bi-annual international conventions {{until the age of}} thirty-two, often including his sister Jacki in concerts and events. His song America My Home was the first song in the convention's history to be performed and included as official business. DePiro performed the song on the convention floor during the 1994 convention in Las Vegas. DePiro produced a Christmas album in 1984 for vocalist Raine Austen and got his first national jingle contract writing and performing jingles with Ms. Austen for a (then) new chain of <b>the</b> <b>Muffler</b> Man Supply Company, Rainbow Muffler.|$|E
500|$|The {{final cut}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{consists}} of two continuous sixty-second dolly shots taken from a technocrane, stitched together [...] later in post-production. (The stitching appears during the moment when <b>the</b> <b>muffler</b> rolls across the floor.) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off {{the movement of the}} parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second. Between testing and filming, 606takes were needed to capture the final cut. The team commandeered two of Honda's six hand-assembled Accords—one to roll off the trailer {{at the end of the}} advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this {{research}} work, {{the effectiveness of}} stainless steel sheet {{for the production of}} motor cycle exhaust muffler burn protector was investigated. Energy Dispersive X-Ray fluorescence method was used to determine the chemical composition of the stainless steel materials and exhaust <b>muffler</b> of <b>the</b> motor cycle. The stainless steel sheet was perforated and folded to frustum shape to achieve aero dynamic shape and used as protective cover on <b>the</b> exhaust <b>muffler</b> to protect <b>the</b> leg from burns. The burn protector produced was mounted on Jincheng AX 100 motor cycle and driving test carried out for 15 days using operational periods of 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes to determine its effectiveness. Cole Palmer thermocouple digital meter was used to measure the surface temperatures of <b>the</b> exhaust <b>muffler</b> and burn protector {{at the end of each}} operation cycle and data generated was averaged. The experimental results show that the longer the driving period the higher the temperatures of both <b>the</b> exhaust <b>muffler</b> and exhaust burn protector. At the maximum driving test period of 90 minutes, the temperature of <b>the</b> exhaust <b>muffler</b> rose from 0. 2 o C to 92 o C and that of <b>the</b> Exhaust <b>muffler</b> burn protector rose from 0. 2 o C to 10 o C respectively. The difference in the temperatures is 82 o C, which is significant. The stainless steel material is therefore suitable for the production of <b>the</b> exhaust <b>muffler</b> burn protector.

60|$|The turn in {{the road}} was almost gained, and both {{machines}} had slowed down once more, when there came a shrill, screeching whistle from behind, and a racing car shot into sight, moving along with a great noise, for <b>the</b> <b>muffler</b> had been cut out.

60|$|Arnold {{looked after}} him in surprise. It was very seldom that Isaac vouchsafed {{any form of}} {{greeting}} or farewell. And then the shock came. Isaac's companion, who had been leaning over the banisters, waiting for him, had loosened <b>the</b> <b>muffler</b> about his neck and opened his overcoat. His features were now recognizable--a pale face with deep-set eyes and prominent forehead, a narrow chin, and a mouth which seemed set in a perpetual snarl. Arnold stood gazing up at him in rapt amazement. He had seen that face but once before, yet there was no possibility of any mistake. It seemed, indeed, as though the recognition were mutual, for the man above, with an angry cry, turned suddenly away, buttoning up his overcoat with feverish fingers. He called out to Isaac--a hurried sentence, in a language which was strange to Arnold. There was a brief exchange of breathless words. Arnold moved slowly away, but before he had reached the street Isaac's hand was upon his shoulder.|$|E

60|$|He played hockey with an {{extraordinary}} zest and nimbleness.

60|$|Her visitor, she saw as {{she opened}} the door, was seated in the {{armchair}} before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged head drooping on one side. The only light in the room was the red glow from the fire--which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his downcast face in darkness--and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door. Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct to her, the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and her eyes were dazzled. But for a second {{it seemed to her that}} the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open--a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face. It was the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle eyes, and this huge yawn below it. Then he stirred, started up in his chair, put up his hand. She opened the door wide, so that the room was lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with <b>the</b> <b>muffler</b> held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before.

60|$|Standing in {{the tomb}} {{where the air}} was close and heavy, the pale glimmer of the lantern showed piles of moldering coffins in the niches, and {{everywhere}} lay tokens of decay and death.

Nearest the door stood a long casket covered with black velvet and richly decorated with silver ornaments, tarnished now. The Trevlyns had been a stalwart race, and the last sleeper brought there had evidently been of goodly stature, for the modern coffin was as ponderous as the great oaken beds where lay the bones of generations. Lifting the lantern, the intruder brushed the dust from the shield-shaped plate, read the name RICHARD TREVLYN and a date, and, as if satisfied, placed a key in the lock, half-raised the lid, and, averting his head {{that he might not}} see the ruin seventeen long years had made, he laid his hand on the dead breast and from the folded shroud drew a mildewed paper. One glance sufficed, the casket was relocked, the door rebarred, the light extinguished, and the man vanished like a ghost {{in the darkness of the}} wild October night.|$|E

In order to present such influence, the turbulent flow and heat transfer is modeled in <b>the</b> suction <b>muffler</b> of a hermetic refrigeration compressor. Several turbulence models are employed, including standard engineering models as the k-ε and SST. The results are treated to observe the gas superheating during the flow through <b>the</b> suction <b>muffler,</b> which is performed through the heat flux mapping, outlet suction muffler temperature variations and heat transfer coefficient on muffler walls. Standard care is taken in consideration with a mesh refinement study to reduce numerical uncertainties and with the near wall treatment suitable for each model used in the investigation...|$|R
