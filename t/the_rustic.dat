5|$|Among {{the notable}} {{artificial}} {{structures in the}} TMD are ramadas, picnic tables, and restrooms built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1933 and 1941. Designed to conform to their natural surrounds, <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> buildings consist mainly of quarried stone and other materials native to the area.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one cabins {{can be used}} by {{visitors}} at Black Moshannon State Park. Thirteen are rustic cabins, built by the CCC, with electric lights, a kitchen stove and a wood-burning stove, refrigerator, and bunk beds. Six are modern cabins, including the former ski lodge, with electric heat, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bath. There are also two deluxe camping cottages with electric heat and similar amenities as <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> cabins. All cabin renters need to bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. Pets are prohibited in all cabins in the park.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Macedonian painted artwork {{includes}} frescoes and murals, {{but also}} decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still {{exist on the}} bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.|$|E

The comic performance by <b>the</b> <b>rustics</b> of Pyramus and Thisbe at the final wedding takes on an added dimension as a parody of nineteenth-century Italian opera.

25|$|There are {{eighteen}} primary {{structures in}} the Munson Valley Historic District.

60|$|With {{cries of}} dismay and anger the others, the parson, the Justice and <b>the</b> <b>rustics</b> got between <b>the</b> pair, for Sir Oliver was looking very wicked, {{and all the}} world knew him {{for a man to}} be feared.|$|R
25|$|In 1933 a {{committee}} in Brussels commissioned the sculptor Jules Jourdan {{to create a}} medallion of Joubert based on photographs. This adorns <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> memorial that the White Fathers erected in his memory on the heights overlooking the lake at Baudouinville.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{tail of the}} Côte de Beaune sees Pinot noir predominate, with 90% of {{wine from}} Santenay being red. The wines are solid, tending more towards <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> than the elegant, but are cheaper than the big names to the north. Santenay has 124ha of Premier Crus in its 379ha.|$|E
25|$|When {{designing}} the eastern facade facing the Logården, Tessin {{is believed to}} have thought of a Roman country villa, with stairs from the palace garden up to the palace gate. The model for the central part, with colossal pilasters between the windows of the two top floor and <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> ground floor, are presumed to be Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi in Rome.|$|E
60|$|Dusk {{was already}} dropping, <b>the</b> <b>rustics</b> in <b>the</b> tavern were already lurching and lumbering {{out of it}} by twos and threes, crying {{clamorous}} good nights to a solitary old toper that remained, before MacIan and Turnbull had reached the really {{important part of their}} discussion.|$|R
60|$|The company's {{entrance}} into the township of Guichen, if not exactly triumphal, as Binet had expressed the desire that it should be, was at least sufficiently startling and cacophonous to set <b>the</b> <b>rustics</b> gaping.

25|$|At Munson Valley, rustic {{structures}} successfully {{blend with}} the natural environment. The buildings in the historic district are excellent examples of <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> style of architecture, and represent one of the National Park Service's most successful development programs. In addition, the landscape surrounding the historic district remains virtually intact. As a result, the Munson Valley Historic District is significant {{as an expression of}} American naturalistic design.|$|E
25|$|Visitors {{can stay}} {{overnight}} at Ohiopyle State Park's Kentuck Campground, or rent a cottage. The campground has 226 campsites with 27 {{of them being}} walk-in, tent only sites. All campsites have a picnic table and fire ring, modern restrooms with hot showers and flush toilets, and four playgrounds. <b>The</b> <b>rustic</b> cottages have electricity, but lack running water. Each cottage can sleep five people in single or double bunks.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} district also includes six rustic stone Employee Cottages built for park staff between 1927 and 1931. These housing units are designated as buildings #24, 25, 28, 30, 31, and 32. They are architecturally significant {{because they were}} part of the original Munson Valley headquarters master plan, and were constructed in <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> style using native stone and timber. While aluminum roofs were added in the mid-1950s, these units still retain their original character.|$|E
60|$|Clearly {{this was}} the spot which, {{under the name of}} the Hole of Cree, bore such a {{sinister}} reputation among <b>the</b> <b>rustics.</b> I could not wonder at its impressing their imagination, for a more weird or gloomy scene, or one more worthy of the avenue which led to it, could not be conceived.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the queen}} began to {{institute}} changes in court customs. Some of them {{met with the}} disapproval of the older generation, such as the abandonment of heavy make-up and the popular wide-hooped panniers. The new fashion called for a simpler feminine look, typified first by <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> robe à la polonaise style and later by the gaulle, a layered muslin dress Marie Antoinette wore in a 1783 Vigée-Le Brun portrait. In 1780 she began to participate in amateur plays and musicals in a theatre built for her by Richard Mique at the Petit Trianon.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} among those {{constructed}} in Mississippi by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. CCC Company 3497 began work creating the park in April 1935; the park {{opened to the public}} in May 1939. Many of the original facilities are extant, including several buildings, trails, picnic tables, campgrounds, cabins and a fishing pond used by the CCC workers themselves. <b>The</b> <b>rustic</b> quality of the CCC structures resulted from the use of native materials, their original designs, and the craftsmanship of the builders. While most of the facilities in Mississippi were built of wood, Tishomingo and Wall Doxey state parks feature substantial use of stone construction.|$|E
25|$|The Breakfast Room: A private small low-ceilinged room on <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> {{floor of}} the south front. In the 18th century this was the house's only bathroom; more of an indoor {{swimming}} pool, the sunken plunge pool was heated and the room decorated in the Pompeian style complete with Corinthian columns. Converted by the Russian Countess of Pembroke to a breakfast room circa 1815, it is today wallpapered in a Chinese design, the paper being an exact copy of that used in the original 1815 decoration of the room. The 18th century furniture of a simulated-bamboo, Gothic style gives this private dining room a distinct oriental atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Le lieu du crime (1986) (Scene of the Crime) {{begins with}} a shot {{right out of the}} opening of Great Expectations. In <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> {{vicinity}} of a small provincial town, a young boy helps an escaped criminal. The boy (a highly troubled youth himself) disaffected by his parents' divorce, lives with his mother and grandparents while the father lives nearby. The escaped convict commits murder to save the boy from harm but gets involved with the mother. By the time the boy is to have his first communion, the mother—trapped in a humdrum existence—has fallen in love with the convict and wants to run away with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{north and}} south walls of the Church hold the fragmentary remains of {{possibly}} 8 different layers of wall painting, dating in age from the 15th to 18th centuries. The principle pre-reformation schemes were painted as sequences of paintings running {{for much of the}} length of the wall. On the north wall this {{takes the form of a}} series of rustic frames, evoking an idea of a wooden framework, which would have held a series of pictures, possibly depicting the passion, although the images within the frames are hard to decipher. Also on the north wall, overlaying some of <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> frames, is a pre-reformation painting of an unknown Bishop, occupying an elaborate 'fictive architectural niche'.|$|E
25|$|On {{the sacred}} mountain, the nymphs {{who were the}} daughter-spirits of the river Cebrenus, had their haunt, and one, Oenone, who had the chthonic gifts of prophetic vision and the {{curative}} powers of herb magic, wed Paris, living as a shepherd on Mount Ida. Unbeknownst to all, even to himself, Paris {{was the son of}} Priam, king of Troy. He was there on Mount Ida, experiencing <b>the</b> <b>rustic</b> education in exile of many heroes of Greek mythology, for his disastrous future effect on Troy was foretold at his birth, and Priam had him exposed on the sacred slopes. When the good shepherd who was entrusted with the baby returned to bury the exposed child, he discovered that he had been suckled by a she-bear (a totem animal of the archaic goddess Artemis) and took the child home to be foster-nursed by his wife.|$|E
