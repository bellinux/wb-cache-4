5|$|The GAO {{released}} its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation {{determined that the}} USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>their</b> contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>their</b> contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|E
5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she told them {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not hear from her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>their</b> daughter missing.|$|E

5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} by bad weather, and the runway was unusable from September to November 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>their</b> knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured. The outbreak of war in the Pacific saw slit trenches being dug at the base.|$|E
5|$|Lawsuits {{were filed}} against Barr by GOP members in Pennsylvania {{to prevent the}} {{candidate}} from appearing on the state's ballot on charges that the Libertarian Party tricked individuals into signing the state's ballot access petition. Commonwealth Court Judge Johnny Butler dismissed these allegations on September 16, allowing Barr {{to remain on the}} state's ballot. The Barr campaign filed a lawsuit to prevent John McCain and Barack Obama from appearing on the ballot in Texas, charging that the candidates' parties did not reach the state's August 26 deadline <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>their</b> nominations to the Secretary of State. Texas Secretary of State Esperanza Andrade reported that all the correct paperwork was filed, though neither the Democratic nor Republican parties formally nominated their candidates (at their respective conventions) until after the deadline.|$|E
5|$|The Hot Latin Songs chart (formerly Hot Latin 50 and Hot Latin Tracks), {{published}} in Billboard magazine, {{is a record}} chart based on Latin music airplay. The data were compiled by the Billboard chart and research department with information from 70 Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Those radio stations were selected based on their number of listeners, and were asked <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>their</b> playlists for the week. This information was then entered to the Billboard computer system, and points were tabulated for each song. This data are compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 120 music markets across the United States. Before this chart's inception, the Latin music information on the magazine was presented only {{in the form of}} the biweekly album sales chart Top Latin Albums, which continues to be listed separately.|$|E

5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>their</b> finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

It is instrumental for keeping time, in that UTC {{is basically the}} atomic time synchronized to Earth's rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry {{is an important step}} in the cosmic distance ladder because it establishes parallax distance estimates for stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
