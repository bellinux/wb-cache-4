5|$|Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is <b>the</b> <b>Bastard,</b> Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|E

5|$|William I (c. 1028– 9September 1087), usually {{known as}} William the Conqueror and {{sometimes}} William <b>the</b> <b>Bastard,</b> {{was the first}} Norman King of England, reigning from 1066 {{until his death in}} 1087. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as Duke William II) from 1035 onward. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England six years later. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse has a {{large and}} robust skull with {{well-developed}} zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region of the skull (between the eyes) is smooth, as in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>bastard</b> big-footed mouse. The palate is broad and the incisive foramina (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad. In the mandible (lower jaw), {{the root of the}} lower incisor is housed in a distinct capsular process, a protuberance {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The lower masseteric ridge (a crest on the outer side of the mandible) is prominent. As is typical of Macrotarsomys, the molars are cuspidate and low-crowned.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} three endemic species of tree, the Arran {{whitebeam}}s. These trees are the Scottish or Arran whitebeam (Sorbus arranensis), <b>the</b> <b>bastard</b> mountain ash or cut-leaved whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) and the Catacol whitebeam (Sorbus pseudomeinichii). If rarity {{is measured by}} numbers alone they are amongst the most endangered tree species in the world. They are protected in Glen Diomhan off Glen Catacol, {{at the north end}} of the island by a partly fenced off national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 236 Sorbus pseudofennica and 283 Sorbus arranensis were recorded as mature trees in 1980. They are typically trees of the mountain slopes, close to the tree line. However, they will grow at lower altitudes, and are being preserved within Brodick Country Park.|$|E

5|$|In 1418, Glarentza and Chlemoutsi {{passed into}} the hands of Carlo I Tocco, who began to expand his territories in the Morea at the expense of Prince Centurione II Zaccaria. After his defeat by the Byzantine navy in the 1427 Battle of the Echinades, however, Tocco was forced to cede his {{possessions}} to the Despot of the Morea, Constantine Palaiologos (who would become the last Byzantine emperor), {{in the form of a}} dowry for his daughter Maddalena Tocco. Chlemoutsi now became Constantine's residence and his base of operations against the last major Latin stronghold, the city of Patras, in 1428–30. The castle remained in Byzantine hands until it was captured, along with the rest of the Morea, by the Ottoman Empire in 1460. <b>The</b> <b>bastard</b> son of Centurione II, John Asen Zaccaria, was also imprisoned at Chlemoutsi, but managed to escape in 1453 and lead a rebellion against the Byzantine Despots of the Morea.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to its {{discovery}} at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse {{was also}} found as a subfossil in cave deposits at Andrahomana in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and house mouse (Mus musculus), as well as indigenous rodents such as <b>the</b> <b>bastard</b> big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were radiocarbon dated to 790–410BCE and 150–390CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. Macrotarsomys species are thought to burrow in sandy ground {{and would not be}} expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse could conceivably persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.|$|E
5|$|The single known living specimen, a {{young adult}} male, was {{collected}} at 80m (260ft) altitude in the Andaladomo forest (part of the Mikea Forest) in 2003. The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation {{from the rest of}} the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar. The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry deciduous forest amid land cleared for maize cultivation. The trap was set at the foot of a tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants. Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include <b>the</b> <b>bastard</b> big-footed mouse, the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus), several species of tenrecs, and the shrew Suncus madagascariensis. Although only a single individual of Petter's big-footed mouse was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100trap-nights, they argue that this does not necessarily mean the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season. Nothing is known of its behavior, but the animal's morphology suggests it lives on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Although Suffolk was {{receiving}} minimal financial {{benefit from the}} new regime, he still took conspicuous part in all the major state ceremonies. Such events ranged from the 1465 royal wedding to tournaments such as that between Lord Scales and <b>the</b> <b>Bastard</b> of Burgundy in 1467. By this time the king's relations with the powerful Earl of Warwick had soured {{to the point that}} the discontented earl was fomenting rebellion against Edward. Suffolk remained loyal to his brother-in-law, and appears to have taken no part in the Neville/Woodville feud that occupied much of the second half of the decade. Suffolk particularly helped the king crush the Lincolnshire Rebellion in 1469 and participated at the Battle of Empingham early the following year. Edward was subsequently forced into exile however, and Suffolk appears not to have been trusted by the resurgent Lancastrian government, possibly because he refused to come to London to meet the chancellor, even if he appears to have come rapidly to terms with the new government personally. His wife kept in touch with her exiled brothers in Burgundy. When Edward IV returned to England in March 1471, de la Pole joined him on that campaign, in which Edward regained his throne. Thus Suffolk also took part in the battles of Barnet (at which Warwick was killed) and Tewkesbury (at which the House of York finally crushed the remnants of the Lancastrian army).|$|E
5|$|Monastic {{foundations}} {{were once}} abundant in Dorset, but all {{ceased to exist}} at the Dissolution. The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until {{the turn of the}} 18th century. Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include <b>the</b> <b>Bastard</b> brothers' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and St George's Church on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren. From the late 18th century onwards, churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style. A notable exception to this trend, however, is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth—the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation. George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church. It was completed in 1789. Bournemouth, founded in 1810, has a wealth of 19th-century churches including St Peter's and St Stephen's. St Dunstan's Church (formerly St Osmund's) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th-century churches in Dorset. The final major work of Edward Schroeder Prior, {{it is one of the}} last examples of the Neo Byzantine style. The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its elaborate engraved glass windows designed by Laurence Whistler. Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940, the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced every window by 1984.|$|E

25|$|On another instance, {{a meeting}} with sharp lances was {{arranged}} to take place near Nantes, {{under the auspices of}} the Constable of France and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter was a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers was slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance without further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir Tristram de la Jaille of Poitou advanced from the ranks and jousted three courses, without hurt. A duel followed between Edward Beauchamp, son of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and <b>the</b> <b>bastard</b> Clarius de Savoye. Clarius was much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. <b>The</b> <b>bastard</b> then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire named Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat with swords and lances was very violent, but neither of the parties was hurt.|$|E

John called a final synod at Neopatras in December 1277, where an anti-unionist council of eight bishops, a few abbots, and one hundred monks, again anathematized (excommunicated/shunned/cursed) Emperor, Patriarch, and Pope.|$|E
