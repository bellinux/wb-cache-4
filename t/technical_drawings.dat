5|$|Germany's {{refusal to}} give the Dutch access to plans {{detailing}} {{the design of the}} Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a major problem. Inexperienced in designing an underwater protection scheme for a ship of this size, the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance, which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940. Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> or the battleship , then under construction, possibly to ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret, they were allowed to visit , toured several shipyards, interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy, and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts, the ItaliansGermany's allyknowing some details of the ships.|$|E

40|$|The {{automatic}} {{analysis and}} retrieval of <b>technical</b> line <b>drawings</b> is hindered by many challenges such as: {{the large amount}} of contextual clutter around the symbols within the drawings, degradation, transformations on the symbols in drawings, large databases of drawings and large alphabets of symbols. The core tasks required for the analysis of <b>technical</b> line <b>drawings</b> are: symbol recognition, spotting and retrieval. The current systems for performing these tasks have poor performance due to the mentioned challenges. This dissertation presents a number of methods that address these challenges. These methods achieve both accurate and efficient symbol spotting and retrieval in <b>technical</b> line <b>drawings,</b> and perform significantly better than state-of-the-art methods on the same problems. An overview of the key contributions of this dissertation is given in the following. First, this dissertation presents a geometric matching-based method for symbol recognition and spotting. The method performs recognition in the presence of large amounts of contextual clutter, and provides precise localization of the recognized symbols. On standard databases such as GREC- 2005 and GREC- 2011, the method achieves up to 10...|$|R

25|$|Drafting or {{technical}} drawing is {{the means by}} which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} called Caproni Bristol {{is actually}} a Bristol-Coandă monoplane, an aircraft type that was designed by Romanian aeronautical engineer and aviation pioneer Henri Coandă for the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, Ltd. First flown in 1912, the aircraft currently {{on display at the}} Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics was built by Bristol in the United Kingdom, and sent to Italy together with <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> so that Caproni could manufacture the type under licence. Two Caproni-built Coandă monoplanes underwent tests for evaluation, among other participants, by the Italian Ministry of War in 1913, but were not selected for production. However, Caproni later sold several aircraft of this type to the Italian Army. The Bristol-Coandă monoplane in the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics is the oldest surviving Bristol aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In September 1952, <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> of the Fairey Delta 2 {{were issued}} and the {{development}} proper commenced. From the project's beginning, Fairey designed {{the parameters of the}} FD2 to intentionally exceed that which was necessary only to achieving Mach 1. In addition to seeking very high performance, the design adopted a general configuration and structure that would be readily adapted to future military requirements, so that it could potentially become a fighter aircraft. In total, a pair of flight-capable aircraft were produced: Serial numbers WG774 and WG777. WG777, the second to be manufactured, was very similar to WG774 apart from the underwing flap system have been eliminated, there were also a few differences in terms of equipment and instrumentation. In addition to the two flying aircraft, a single static test airframe was also completed.|$|E
40|$|This article {{takes the}} {{changing}} {{status of the}} technical drawing and—to a lesser extent—the technical specification in early twentieth century Japan {{as a case study}} for analyzing the way that mediation, the translation of concepts between media, functions within the design process: both the functions desired for mediation, and the role that mediation can play. Beginning with historical context and precedents, then moving onwards to discuss technical drawing and specifications for woodworking in Japan circa 1900 - 1915, it analyzes the changes prescribed for technical drawing and writing for furniture-making professionals. It speculates as to the logic behind <b>technical</b> <b>drawing’s</b> promotion to both professionals and the general public, and suggests that its promoters hoped that mediation would {{play a key role in}} the professionalization of woodworking as a modern scientific and rational discipline.
