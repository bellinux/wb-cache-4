5|$|By 1920, due {{in large}} part to the city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way <b>to</b> <b>energize</b> a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E

25|$|Helical railguns are {{multi-turn}} railguns {{that reduce}} rail and brush current {{by a factor}} equal {{to the number of}} turns. Two rails are surrounded by a helical barrel and the projectile or re-usable carrier is also helical. The projectile is energized continuously by two brushes sliding along the rails, and two or more additional brushes on the projectile serve <b>to</b> <b>energize</b> and commute several windings of the helical barrel direction in front of and/or behind the projectile. The helical railgun is a cross between a railgun and a coilgun. They do not currently exist in a practical, usable form.|$|E

Photosystem II and photosystem I contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy and use it <b>to</b> <b>energize</b> electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic. ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow {{back out into the}} stroma—much like a dam turbine.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} in the state between radicals and conservatives continued throughout 1829 and 1830. After {{the failure of a}} state project to arrange financing of a railroad within the state to promote internal trade, the state petitioned Congress to invest $250,000 in the company trying to build the railroad. After Congress tabled the measure, the debate in South Carolina resumed between those who wanted state investment and those who wanted to work to get Congress' support. The debate demonstrated that a significant minority of the state did have an interest in Clay’s American System. The effect of the Webster–Hayne debate was <b>to</b> <b>energize</b> the radicals, and some moderates started to move in their direction.|$|E

25|$|Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the {{potential}} energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy <b>to</b> <b>energize</b> electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up {{to a thousand}} times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing {{back out into the}} stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position {{to be used in the}} dark reactions.|$|E
25|$|The Key System, a {{local transit}} company, {{acquired}} the general {{offices of the}} California and Nevada {{as well as their}} nascent pier into San Francisco Bay, which was quickly transformed into a long pier reaching nearly to Yerba Buena Island. The Key System established its main rail yard adjacent to the yard of the Santa Fe in a large tract west of San Pablo Avenue in the vicinity of Yerba Buena Avenue (so named because the island was visible in line with the thoroughfare). The Key System's main power plant, used <b>to</b> <b>energize</b> its streetcars and commuter trains, was constructed adjacent to the city limits with Oakland. The immense smokestack was a local landmark for decades, surviving right through the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. It was demolished for safety reasons shortly thereafter. The old Key System mainline to the pier, and later, to the Bay Bridge, ran in a subway below Beach Street and the Southern Pacific mainline near the power plant. That subway survives and is today used as a private entrance to the main sewage treatment plant of East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD, the water utility serving Oakland and many surrounding cities). The rail yards and shops of the Key System and Santa Fe were acquired by Santa Fe's real estate development arm, later known as the Catellus Development Corporation, and this firm proceeded to develop the site into a shopping center and multiunit residential district which remains there today.|$|E

500|$|Until the Whole World Hears {{met with}} an overall mixed to {{positive}} response from critics. Several critics regarded the musical aspects of the album as mediocre or sub-par, while others praised the album's lyrical content.

40|$|Addition <b>to</b> <b>energized</b> rat liver {{mitochondria}} of low micromolar {{concentrations of}} the thiol oxidant, copper-ophenanthroline Addition <b>to</b> <b>energized</b> rat liver mitochondria of low micromolar concentrations of the thiol oxidant, copper-o-phenanthroline [Cu(OP) 2], causes {{opening of the}} permeability transition pore, a cyclosporin A-sensitive channel. The effects of Cu(OP) 2 can be reversed by reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT), suggesting that a dithiol-disulfide interconversion is involved. However, at variance with all pore inducers known to act through dithiol oxidation, the effects of Cu(OP) 2 are not prevented by treatment of mitochondria with low (10 - 20 microM) concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Rather, these concentrations of NEM potentiate the inducing effects of Cu(OP) 2. We show that this enhancing effect of NEM is blocked by the subsequent addition of DTT, indicating that potentiation by NEM is mediated by an oxidative event rather than by substitution as such. We find that also pore induction by high (0. 5 - 1. 0 mM) concentrations of NEM {{in the absence of}} oxidants is completely blocked by reduction with DTT or beta-mercaptoethanol. These results underscore the unexpected importance of oxidative events in pore opening by substituting agents. Since we find that pore opening by Cu(OP) 2 or by high concentrations of NEM is not accompanied by dimerization of the adenine nucleotide translocase, we conclude that the translocase itself is not the target of the pore-inducing oxidative events triggered by Cu(OP) 2 and NEM...|$|R
