Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K.

As {{a member of}} the legislature, in general the President must assent to all laws passed by the legislature. However, the President has limited discretionary executive powers to withhold assent to certain bills, including attempts by the Government <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> financial reserves accumulated by past governments, to change the investment ability of the Central Provident Fund Board, and to alter the President's own discretionary powers.|$|E

However, the platysma plays only a minor role in depressing the lip which is primarily performed by the depressor anguli oris and the depressor labii inferioris by Dr. Hardy Franklin.|$|E
25|$|The {{four years}} after his release from the Tower were mainly passed in retirement, but on the {{accession}} of Queen Anne, he plunged into political life again with avidity.

Through the fear of the ministry that his restless spirit would drive him into opposition to its measures if he stayed at home, he was appointed early in 1705 to command an expedition to Spain, during the War of the Spanish Succession.|$|E

25|$|When {{river flow}} wasn't quite {{enough for two}} turbines, {{operation}} was cycled between running one and both turbines, based on a daily reservoir draw-down and refill cycle. The cycling was timed to meet peak electrical demands. That is, both turbines operated during hours of high electrical demand and the reservoir was drawn down. A single turbine operated during low electrical demand hours while the reservoir refilled. A similar cycle was used when inflow was less than enough for a single turbine. A weekly cycle was superimposed on the daily cycle that tended <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> the reservoir during the week and allowed it refill during the weekend. In these cases, known as load factoring, the plant operated as a peaking plant. This mode of operation was greatly reduced through the 1980s and 1990s to appease lakefront cabin owners.|$|E
25|$|The {{office of}} the Elected President of Singapore {{represents}} an indigenisation of the Westminster system of government and is cast as a check against the powers enjoyed by the parliamentary executive, adding to the overall scheme {{of checks and balances}} in the doctrine of separation of powers. Nonetheless, the institution has a limited range of functions and is essentially reactive in nature, such that it cannot be seen to be an alternative locus of political power. The President has power to block attempts by the Government <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> past reserves it did not accumulate, to approve changes to key appointments, and to exercise oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and decisions of the executive under the ISA and the MRHA. The aim is not to enable the President to target unlawful executive actions, but lawful actions against national interests.|$|E
25|$|Maaseh Merkabah (Working of the Chariot) is {{the modern}} name {{given to a}} Hekhalot text, {{discovered}} by scholar Gershom Scholem. Works of the Chariot dates from late Hellenistic period, {{after the end of}} the Second Temple period following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when the physical cult ceased to function. The idea of making a journey to the heavenly hekhal seems to be a kind of spiritualization of the pilgrimages to the earthly hekhal that were now no longer possible. It is a form of pre-Kabbalah Jewish mysticism that teaches both of the possibility of making a sublime journey to God and of the ability of man <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> divine powers to earth; it seems to have been an esoteric movement that grew out of the priestly mysticism already evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls and some apocalyptic writings (see the studies by Rachel Elior).|$|E

25|$|In 1991 the Constitution of Singapore was {{amended to}} {{transform}} the office of President, which was previously indirectly elected by Parliament, into an office directly elected by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts {{by the government of}} the day <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> past reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the Central Provident Fund Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.|$|E

2500|$|The Government {{took the}} view that the {{safeguards}} could be achieved by providing the direct election of the President, thus making the President directly accountable to the people, and enabling him to serve as a check against the Government by increasing his discretionary powers. [...] The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1991 granted the President certain executive functions to block attempts by the government of the day <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> past reserves that it had not accumulated, and to approve changes to key civil service positions.

2500|$|According to the Kabbalistic explanation, the Seraphim ("burning" [...] angels) in Beriah (divine understanding) realise their {{distance}} from the absolute divinity of Atziluth. Their call, [...] "Holy", repeated three times, means removed or separated. This causes their [...] "burning up" [...] continual self-nullification, ascending to God and returning to their place. Their understanding realises instead that God's true purpose (glory) for creation is with lowly man. The lower Hayyot ("living" [...] angels) in Yetzirah (divine emotions) say, [...] "Blessed" [...] (etymologically in Kabbalah [...] "drawing down" [...] blessing) be the glory...from [...] "His (distant-unknown to them) place" [...] of Atziluth. Though lower than the Seraphim, their emotional self-awareness has a superior advantage of powerful desire. This causes {{them to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> divine vitality from a higher source, the supreme realm of Atziluth, to lower creation and man.

2500|$|Drought {{has also}} {{affected}} the dam's operation. No water {{was permitted to}} flow over the dam in 1986 due to drought. In 1992, water flowed over the dam's crest on only a single day.

By May 2004, the dam was permitting only [...] to [...] per second downriver. These flows were well below the [...] per second {{needed to keep the}} fishery healthy. The low water flows, coupled with whirling disease, led to a 40 percent drop in big fish (those over [...] in length) as well as lower overall numbers of fish immediately below the dam. A 2005 proposal by the managers of the Helena National Forest <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> Holter Lake by [...] in August 2005 in order to repair Coulter Campground near the Gates of the Mountains had fishermen and recreational outfitters angry due to the likely side-effects on the downstream fishery.

A 2006-2007 survey of burbot and stonecats in the Missouri River immediately below Holter Dam found four times as many burbot as expected. Heavy snowpack and spring rains in 2008, however, forced dam operators to increase the flow to [...] per second.
