5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame.

From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E

Theramenes also appears in several ancient narrative histories: Thucydides' account includes the beginnings of Theramenes' career, and Xenophon, picking up where Thucydides left off, gives {{a detailed account of}} several episodes from Theramenes career; Diodorus Siculus, probably drawing his account from Ephorus at most points, provides another account that varies widely from Xenophon's at several points.

5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis supply port of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} {{by a pair of}} torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes.

The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green flares were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, US troops fired flares <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector <b>to</b> <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex sight housing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{building}} industry recognizes {{the importance of}} incorporating daylighting into the illumination of buildings to improve energy performance and lighting quality. There are several well-known methods that building designers use to increase the daylighting level in buildings, including windows and skylights. However, these methods are usually not capable of <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> core of the building, and may increase the energy usage of the building due to reduced insulation. There are other systems designed for <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> core of buildings with daylighting, but all have some limitations that have impeded widespread adoption. An alternate daylighting system described here offers a novel approach <b>to</b> <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> core of buildings. This system consists of active and passive optical components that capture sunlight outside multi-floor buildings and transfer it to the dark core. Active sunlight redirectors, mounted at roof level {{on the edge of}} the building, track the sun throughout the day and redirect the sunlight towards building façades at a certain angle. Passive concentrator elements mounted on the façades of the building capture and concentrate the light and direct it into light guides. The sunlight is then distributed within the building via interior light guides <b>to</b> efficiently <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> building...|$|R
