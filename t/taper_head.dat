40|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>head</b> {{facets of}} ZnO {{nanorods}} are unique morphologies that offer potential applications in photoconductivity, chemical sensing, UV photodetection and optoelectronic display.

From our CFCOM gas synthesis technique, we have grown ZnO nanorods with <b>tapered</b> <b>head</b> facets at a rapid rate of 100 nm/s in just 15 s whereby the quenching stage could be crucial in retaining the <b>tapered</b> <b>heads.</b> Unstable <b>tapered</b> facets such as planes of { 5220 }, { 3110 }, { 4110 } and { 5110 } could be a contributing factor in the rapid growth rate of CFCOM ZnO rods due to their faster growth rates and high surface energies.

40|$|Background and objective: Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids are synthetic compounds {{based on}} the structure of testosterone, and are used to treat various conditions such as reproductive system dysfunction. High doses of anabolic androgenic steroids and exercise influence the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis, which can, in turn, affect testicular apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the influence of anabolic androgenic steroids on semen parameters in bodybuilders (heavy exercise) in Erbil city. Methods: Semen specimens and serum were collected from 150 which divided into three groups; each consists of 50 men. The control group (A) didn't practice exercise so didn't receive nandrolone. The exercise group (B) who practice daily without taking nandrolone. The exercise and treated group (C) who practice exercise and had been using nandrolone (200 mg- wk- 1, intramuscularly) for at least three months. Smear prepared by methyline blue stain and assessment of semen volume, sperm morphology, sperm concentration,motility were carried out. Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone were also carried out. Results: There was no difference in the semen volume within three groups. Sperm concentration and the percentage of sperm motility in the group C was significantly lower (P < 0. 001) than that in the other groups. A significantly increased percentage of sperm with the <b>tapered</b> <b>head</b> was found in the group C. Our results also demonstrated a significant decrease in testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone in the group C compared to group A and B. Conclusion: Users of anabolic-androgenic steroids have sperm with abnormal shape, especially <b>tapered</b> <b>head,</b> and low concentration of sperm with sluggish motility attributing to infertility...|$|R

The real backwall shape of the rectangularly <b>tapered</b> <b>head</b> was a complicated curve that was obviously different to the simplified header at area of the inlet and the outlet.

40|$|This study tests grouted splices {{connected}} by {{two types of}} sleeves, namely Welded Bar Sleeve (WBS) and <b>Tapered</b> <b>Head</b> Sleeve (THS). These sleeves are made from non-proprietary pipe sections, where (a) WBS is fabricated by welding the deformed bars to the inner wall of the pipe, and (b) THS is made tapered with smaller openings at both ends. To study the behavior, the splice specimens were tested under incremental tensile load at various bar embedded lengths and sleeve diameters. The degree of confinement generated in the sleeve is found to increase with decreasing sleeve diameter. This improves the bond strength in sleeve, which subsequently increases the tensile capacity of the splice. THS gives a 30 % higher tensile capacity compared with WBS. With the active confinement, the required bar embedded length of the splice {{can be reduced to}} 8 times the bar diameter. An analytical model is formulated {{on the basis of the}} confinement stress as expressed in a function of sleeve dimensions. The model is used to predict the tensile capacities of the splices at a variation range of ± 10 % of the experimental results. This verifies the correlations among the sleeve dimensions, the confinement stress and bond strength of the grouted splice...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{relaxation}} and creep are major concerns when loading composite materials. Due to the viscoelactic {{nature of the}} matrix material, composite materials tend to lose initial loads at a decreasing rate. This is especially true through {{the thickness of the}} material, where the behavior of the material is dominated by the matrix. Of particular interest to the current study presented in this thesis is the investigation of stress relaxation in bolted composite/metal hybrid connections. It is ultimately desired {{to be able to use}} bolted composite/metal hybrid connections for naval applications, where it is important to maintain as much of the initial preload in the connection as possible in order to maintain watertight integrity. In order to quantify the stress relaxation in bolted hybrid connections, it was decided to study the connections at a sub-component level. Several different effects were studied in the connections, including reloading effects, possible advantages of using <b>tapered</b> <b>head</b> bolts, and environmental effects. All tests were run for a time period of at least 3 -month in order to get an estimate of long-term stress relaxation effects in the bolted connections.
