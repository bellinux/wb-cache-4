5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things that he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} swear by his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{captured}} militants {{were initially}} {{taken to a}} jail in Prizren, and later transported to a military prison in Niš. On January 8, 1999, the KLA ambushed a convoy carrying rations to VJ personnel in Kosovska Mitrovica, taking eight Yugoslav soldiers hostage. U.S. officials negotiated the soldiers' release five days later. In return, on January 23, Yugoslav authorities freed the nine militants. Almost simultaneously, the KLA released five elderly Serb civilians that it had taken hostage two days earlier. Yugoslav officials insisted that the two events were not linked. The KLA's taking of civilian hostages drew condemnation from Western diplomats, including {{the head of the}} KVM, William Walker, who told reporters: [...] "...I think it was a very unwise and uncivilized <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do to kidnap civilians." [...] Upon being released, the militants alleged they were mistreated and beaten while in custody, and vowed to avenge the deaths of their fellow fighters.|$|E

500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all of a sudden, the practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E
2500|$|But Stewart {{described}} the Kasenetz-Katz deal as a breakthrough: [...] "That {{allowed us to}} get the extra equipment {{to turn it into}} a real studio. To begin with they were interested in Graham's songwriting and when they heard that he was involved in a studio I think they thought the most economical <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do would be to book his studio and then put him to work there – but they ended up recording Graham's songs and then some of Kevin and Lol's songs, and we were all working together." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As I {{have said}} on {{numerous}} occasions, {{we are not}} going to stand for this in Birmingham. And if necessary we will fill the jail full and we don't care whose toes we step on. I am saying now to these meddlers from out of our city the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do is stay out if they don't want to get slapped in jail. Our people of Birmingham are a peaceful people and we never have any trouble here unless some people come into our city looking for trouble. And I've never seen anyone yet look for trouble who wasn't able to find it".|$|E

2500|$|One {{objective}} of genocidal rape is forced pregnancy; however, those unable to bear children are also subject to sexual assault. Victims ages {{can range from}} children to women in their eighties. During the Armenian Genocide the rape of young girls was well documented; they would be assaulted in their homes before forced relocation, or on the forced marches into the Syrian desert. An eyewitness testified, [...] "It was a very common <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to rape our girls in our presence. Very often they violated eight or ten year old girls, {{and as a consequence}} many would be unable to walk, and were shot." [...] Another testified that every girl in her village aged over twelve, and some who were younger, had been raped.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1987, {{two months}} before the series aired on television, a 40-minute {{selection}} of the soundtrack was released as Enya's first solo album, titled Enya, by BBC Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States. The latter promoted it with a new age imprint on the packaging which Nicky later thought was [...] "a cowardly <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do". The album gained enough public attention to reach number 8 on the Irish Albums Chart and number 69 on the UK Albums Chart. [...] "I Want Tomorrow" [...] was released as Enya's first single. [...] "Boadicea" [...] was sampled by The Fugees on their 1996 song [...] "Ready or Not"; the group neither sought permission nor gave her credit, causing Enya to threaten legal action. The group subsequently gave her credit and paid a fee worth around $3million. Later in 1987, she appeared on Sinéad O'Connor's debut album The Lion and the Cobra, reciting Psalm 91 in Gaelic on the song [...] "Never Get Old".|$|E
2500|$|The team, led by Ella, defies Shade's {{orders and}} infiltrates the Meat Factory, {{successfully}} rescuing Drum. They then leave cautiously, using the Deceptors to mask their trail. While resting among {{the branches of}} a large tree, Ninde telepathically detects an Overlord. The detection proves not only to be hard mentally on her since the Overlord is of human or greater intelligence, but also emotionally hard: Ninde discovers that the Overlords are essentially human. Despite the difficulty, she discovers that the Overlord may know something about [...] "a mind in a machine" [...] -a dangerous <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> since Shade - a machine intelligence- is their leader and benefactor. They continue, to discover on reaching the Submarine that it has been invaded by an Overlord, Red Diamond, and that all of the people inside have been killed or captured. Fortunately, Shade had realized long before that the Sub was not a permanent base, and established multiple supply caches throughout the city in case a team was stranded in the field or the Sub was taken. True to their training, the team heads immediately to the nearest cache - to discover Shade, who escaped, apparently by chance, while testing a mobile robotic body for himself based around the Thinker. Shade's escape is doubly fortuitous in that the Overlord used an electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the Submarine; had he been within range of the weapon, he would have been incapacitated.|$|E
