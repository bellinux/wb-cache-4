5|$|Before {{embarking on}} his {{political}} career, he filmed a four-part series based on <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall in 2008. It was aired on RTÉ One in November 2009.|$|E
5|$|Former {{students}} from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech {{refugees from the}} crisis, {{who were able to}} escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{shortly after}} <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall, Zacharias {{was invited to}} speak in Moscow. While there he spoke to {{students}} at the Lenin Military Academy {{as well as political}} leaders at the Center for Geopolitical Strategy. This was the first of many evangelism opportunities towards the political world. Future events included an invitation to Bogota, Colombia in 1993, where he spoke to the judiciary committee on the importance of having a solid moral foundation.|$|E

50|$|This led to <b>the</b> {{resignation}} <b>of</b> four Catholic government {{ministers and}} <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first government <b>of</b> Hendrik Colijn. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet {{became known as}} <b>the</b> Night <b>of</b> Kersten.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall and German reunification {{made for}} a sudden spike of {{importance}} for the Stadtbahn. The first InterRegio train ran to Cologne in 1990. Since 1991, Intercity trains to Karlsruhe, Cologne and Hamburg used the Stadtbahn. The Hamburg line was soon extended to Dresden and Prague, and the former Interzonenzug trains from Munich were converted to InterCity trains and now ran on the Stadtbahn as well.|$|E
5|$|After leaving school, Mühe was {{employed}} as a construction worker and a border guard at the Berlin Wall. He then turned to acting, and from the late 1970s into the 1980s appeared in numerous plays, becoming a star of the Deutsches Theater in East Berlin. He was active in politics and denounced Communist rule in East Germany in a memorable address at the Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November 1989 shortly before <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall. After German reunification he continued to appear in {{a large number of}} films, television programmes and theatre productions. In Germany he was particularly known for playing the lead role of Dr. Robert Kolmaar in the long-running forensic crime series Der letzte Zeuge (The Last Witness, 1998–2007).|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut {{the coat}} of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during the fall of Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the {{coat of arms}} from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as {{the area of the}} German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E

5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news of <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks {{of the year in}} first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Mühe {{played a}} leading role in {{organizing}} the demonstrations that took place prior to the reunification of Germany. He often gave public readings from Walter Jenka's essay Schwierigkeiten mit der Wahrheit (Difficulties with the Truth, 1989) at the Deutsches Theater, before the book was permitted to be published in East Germany. On 4 November 1989 shortly before <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall, in front of half a million people during the Alexanderplatz demonstration, he declared the Communists' monopoly on power to be invalid. In the same year he became internationally known after playing, next to Armin Mueller-Stahl and Klaus Maria Brandauer, the leading role in Bernhard Wicki's Das Spinnennetz (The Spider's Web, based on the expressionist, fragmentary novel of the same name by Austrian writer Joseph Roth) right-wing lieutenant Lohse who sleeps and murders his way to professional success in the early Weimar Republic following a near fatal injury during the Wilhelmshaven mutiny of 29 October 1918.|$|E

5|$|NATO {{was little}} more than a {{political}} association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{noted that}} after <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall, it became {{apparent}} that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong. This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Games {{were the}} last {{to be held in}} the same year as the Summer Games. They were hosted in the French Savoie region in the city of Albertville, though only 18 events were held in the city. The rest of the events were spread out over the Savoie. Political changes of the time were {{reflected}} in the Olympic teams appearing in France: this was the first Games to be held after the fall of Communism and <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Wall, and Germany competed as a single nation {{for the first time since}} the 1964 Games; former Yugoslavian republics Croatia and Slovenia made their debuts as independent nations; most of the former Soviet republics still competed as a single team known as the Unified Team, but the Baltic States made independent appearances for the first time since before World War II. At 16years old, Finnish ski jumper Toni Nieminen made history by becoming the youngest male Winter Olympic champion. New Zealand skier Annelise Coberger became the first Winter Olympic medallist from the southern hemisphere when she won a silver medal in the women's slalom.|$|E

50|$|The Roman {{senate was}} <b>the</b> most {{permanent}} <b>of</b> all of Rome's political institutions. It was probably founded before <b>the</b> first king <b>of</b> Rome ascended <b>the</b> throne. It survived <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Kingdom {{in the late}} 5th century BC, <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Republic in 27 BC, and <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire in 476 AD. It was, in contrast to many modern institutions named 'Senate', not a legislative body, but rather, an advisory one.|$|R
