5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs {{made their way into}} <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} life {{she was in}} a {{relationship}} with the Australian author I. A. R. Wylie; the two of them supported Radclyffe Hall during the obscenity trial of Hall's book, <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Radclyffe Hall drew a crowd after her novel <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness had been {{banned in the}} UK. A reading by poet Edna St. Vincent Millay packed the salon in 1932. At another Friday salon in the 1930s Virgil Thomson sang from Four Saints in Three Acts, an opera based on a {{libretto}} by Gertrude Stein.|$|E

5|$|The pair {{travels to}} Cairo, where they {{meet up with}} Indy's friend Sallah, a skilled excavator. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls with {{a replica of the}} {{headpiece}} (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Indy discovers Marion is alive, bound and gagged in a tent, but does not release her for fear of alerting the Nazis. Indy, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive, seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer.|$|E

30|$|The Hailar Bei 14 {{block is}} located in the Sudeerte {{structural}} belt in the Baier oilfield, where the fault density is high and the artificial fractures are widely distributed. The oil production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> group was increased rapidly after the gas injection in this block, which resulted in a significant decrease in the moisture content, and the effect of gas injection was obvious. However, the oil production was decreasing with the progress of gas injection, and the effect was deteriorated. From the contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single <b>well,</b> <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> crude output in <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>of</b> multi-directional response is higher than that in unidirectional response. <b>The</b> <b>wells</b> <b>of</b> unidirectional response, such as Bei 14 -X 51 - 59, CO 2 enter <b>the</b> production <b>wells</b> quickly after gas injection, so that <b>the</b> <b>well</b> is gas channeling rapidly and the stable phase of the crude output is short. Therefore, from the geostress field and induced stress field, this paper analyzes the development characteristics of fractures in Bei 14 block and its influence on gas injection.|$|R
5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do would keep the book from being treated as pornography.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, {{women began}} to author their own {{thoughts}} and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until {{the publication of}} <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s. Charlotte Brontë's Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E

25|$|A {{screening}} facility typically holds {{a library}} of stock plates, whose contents are carefully catalogued, and each of {{which may have been}} created by the lab or obtained from a commercial source. These stock plates themselves are not directly used in experiments; instead, separate assay plates are created as needed. An assay plate is simply a copy of a stock plate, created by pipetting a small amount of liquid (often measured in nanoliters) from <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>of</b> a stock plate to <b>the</b> corresponding <b>wells</b> <b>of</b> a completely empty plate.|$|R

5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The {{first phase of the}} project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>of</b> Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and VideoDisc in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The outer package was retitled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra in <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Raiders (along with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade) was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008. The film {{was released on}} Blu-ray Disc in September 2012. Previously, only Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had been available on Blu-ray.|$|E

5|$|The only {{video game}} based {{exclusively}} on the film is Raiders of the Lost Ark, released in 1982 by Atari for their Atari 2600 console. The first third of the video game Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, released in 1994 by JVC for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System, is based entirely on the film. Several of the film's sequences are reproduced (the boulder run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several inconsistencies with the film {{are present in the}} game, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present in <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by LucasArts and Factor 5. In the 1999 game Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, a bonus level brings Jones back to the Peruvian temple of the film's opening scene. In 2008, to coincide with the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Lego released the Lego Indiana Jones line—which included building sets based on Raiders of the Lost Ark—and LucasArts published a video game based on the toyline, , which was developed by Traveller's Tales.|$|E
5|$|While campaigning against Venetian forces, Skanderbeg {{managed to}} inflict a serious defeat on July 23, 1448, seriously {{weakening}} Venetian power in Albania. The siege of Svetigrad continued, however, and Marin Barleti {{writes that the}} Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into <b>the</b> <b>well</b> <b>of</b> the fortress, forcing the garrison to refuse to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut off the water supply and induced the garrison to surrender. Given the circumstance, Perlati promised a surrender if the garrison were allowed a safe passage through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that the garrison should be promised safe passage and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would only be intensified through such an act; he decided to instead return the garrisoning force to Skanderbeg. On July 31, 1448 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered.|$|E
