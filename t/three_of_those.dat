5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

5|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen made {{his case to}} bowl {{officials}} {{by saying that the}} Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4–4 teams and not played a game against the fifth, Miami. <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> teams were selected ahead of Maryland: the Meineke Car Care Bowl selected the nearby North Carolina team; the Gator Bowl chose Clemson, a school with a traditionally well-traveling fanbase; and the Emerald Bowl selected Miami. After the higher-priority bowl games made their selections, the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or Wake Forest, the school with the smallest enrollment in any BCS football conference. Humanitarian Bowl officials chose Maryland in light of its larger alumni base, well-traveled fans, and greater television marketing potential.|$|E

5|$|The first NCAA Tournament was {{organized}} by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46–33 in the first championship game.
