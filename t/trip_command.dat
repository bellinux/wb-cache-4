40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative approach to identify potential impacts of cyber attacks on agent-based smart grid protection relays. An agent-based protection framework is developed, where an attacker may injects a malicious breaker <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> to the relay settings. This could cause unintentional tripping of CBs, {{even if there}} is no physical disturbance on the system. It results a healthy line of smart grids to be out-of-service that leads cascading failures. An algorithm is proposed to identify such kind of attack generated latency caused by unexpected malicious <b>trip</b> <b>command.</b> Using this algorithm agents can check the breaker statuses to ensure which line is out-of-service due to unintentional tripping. Furthermore, the proposed technique will be able to distinguish cyber attacks from faults on the system. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this senior project is to protect a three terminal transmission line during fault conditions using the SEL- 311 L microprocessor based relay and communication assisted permissive over-reaching transfer trip protection (POTT). The SEL- 311 L’s directional distance elements are programmed to trip on internal faults while faults external to the zones of protection are ignored. Upon sensing a fault condition, the relay issues a <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> to the local breaker and a permissive key for tripping to the remote relay via fiber optic communication. When a permissive key is received and all other permissive conditions have been satisfied, the remote relay issues a <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> to its breaker. Included in this senior project are lab materials for students who wish to complete the lab or for integration into a power protection laboratory in the future.

40|$|The {{generator}} {{differential protection}} {{is one of}} the most important electrical protections of synchronous generator stator windings. Its operation principle is based on the comparison of the input current and output current at each phase winding. Unwanted <b>trip</b> <b>commands</b> are usually caused by CT saturation, wrong CT selection, or the fact that they may come from different manufacturers. In generators grounded through high impedance, only phase-to-phase or three-phase faults can be detected by the differential protection. This kind of fault causes differential current to flow in, at least, two phases of the winding. Several cases of unwanted <b>trip</b> <b>commands</b> caused by the appearance of differential current in only one phase of the generator have been reported. In this paper multi-phase criterion is proposed for generator differential protection algorithm when applied to high impedance grounded generators...|$|R

For example, when a fault occurs at the line 4 – 19 and circuit breakers 4 & 19 fail to clear the fault section, protection IED of the 35  kV Bus 1 would send <b>tripping</b> <b>commands</b> to circuit breaker 16 to clear the fault instead.|$|R

30|$|Another {{promising}} remote {{technique is}} power line signaling based scheme [14, 15]. This scheme continuously transmits specific signal from upstream substation to downstream DG by a dedicated signal generator. Power line {{is used as}} the communication link. Once the upstream circuit breaker (CB) opens to form an island, the DG is unable to receive the signal. As a result, a <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> is sent to disconnect the DG. This scheme outperforms other methods because the injected signal can distinguish genuine islanding and disturbance. However, {{it is not an}} economical solution, especially when the amount of interconnected DG is small. Besides, when system fault disturbance occurs, the transmitted signal over the power line may be distorted and interrupted, which will lead to mal-operation.|$|E
40|$|A new {{protection}} scheme utilizing digital overcurrent relays {{is proposed}} in this paper.

Fault can thus be cleared without unnecessary loss of loads. By updating the characteristic vector database and the relay trip table, the proposed protection scheme {{can be applied to the}} changed system, thus to achieve adaptive feature. No complex optimization technique is required. A typical distribution system is employed to test the proposed protection scheme and its adaptive approach.

40|$|Since {{it is not}} {{possible}} to optimize a standard relaying system to every protection need, Digital Multifunction protection systems are proposed as they have features like cost efficiency, functional flexibility, adaptive relaying and self checking capability. With the advantage of generally available hardware and software, having the speed and capability of digital relays necessary for protection application, it has now become possible for the relay engineers to develop and implement custom protection solutions for those applications where standard packages may not provide the necessary flexibility or performance. A modified Fullcycle Discrete Fourier Transform (FCDFT) Algorithm based digital multifunction relay is proposed which has capability of executing <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> by extracting exact fundamental frequency component, by eliminating harmonics and decaying DC offset component, during faults in power systems.

30|$|Considering {{the merits}} and demerits {{of the above}} {{described}} works, a fuzzy based method has been implemented based on advantages of VSC converters and DFIG wind farms. Added merits of fuzzy reasoning are {{that it has a}} natural language for communication with human and capable of tolerating imprecise data. Some of the conventional protection schemes like distance relay method suited for AC systems but not for DC due to its low impedance. The main benefits of the proposed scheme is that it uses single relay at the rectifier end to trip under all internal faults and isolate the external fault. The response of the grid side fault is not same as wind farm side fault. Discrimination of both fault and selective tripping has been achieved in the proposed work. Grid side faults are very common. If these faults occur then relay at the AC section of grid side will initiate the <b>trip</b> <b>command.</b> If some temporary fault occurs in wind farm section then the effects are not reflected in DC section. Fuzzy logic approach is appropriate for this problem as one DC section and two AC section whose features under fault are not precisely distinct under various condition.|$|E

These six fault parameters are- over voltage, over current, voltage unbalance, currentunbalance, winding temperature and low voltage. If any of these faults occurs in the system, a delay time is calculatedaccording to the fault strength using fuzzy logic. If the fault persists for a longer time than the computed delay time, thesystem sends a <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> to stop the motor. In classical systems, if delay times are adjusted once, they remain constantirrespective {{of the strength of}} fault. In such a case, if short duration faults occur then this would cease the motor operationwithout waiting. It leads to the disruption of production line in industry. On the other hand, in case of high strength fault, ifsystem waits for too long, the motor can be damaged. So, delay times must be adjusted dynamically and optimally. The 1 stsystem model provides more reliable and sensitive protection system using fuzzy logic rules and 2 nd system represents thefault classification system. To repair after stopping of motor or disruption of production line, it becomes necessary to knowthat which fault has stopped the motor.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for implementing controlled fault interruption, using high voltage, SF 6 circuit breakers on three phase high voltage power networks. The main {{goal of the}} method is to synchronize the opening or <b>trip</b> <b>commands</b> to each phase of a circuit breaker with respect to target current zero times so that each phase will interrupt with a preselected arcing time.

The parameters of the model of the currents are obtained using least mean squares regression. Novel features of the proposed method include the use of analysis-of- variance tests to validate the model for targeting instant selection, provision of algorithm failure bypass control, identification of multiphase fault types and detection of the fault inception instant. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityCyber {{intrusions}} into substations of a {{power grid}} {{are a source of}} vulnerability since most substations are unmanned and with limited protection of the cyber and physical security. In the worst case, simultaneous cyber intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In addition, substation communication protocols do not include cyber security features in their original standard. Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) contains the circuit breaker <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> whereas Sampled Measured Value (SMV) includes measured analog values such as currents and voltages. Due to the importance of substation automation multicast messages, IEC 62351 standards proposed the authentication method as a primary security measure for GOOSE and SMV messages since they required fast transmission time. However, performance testing for the application of the authentication method to GOOSE and SMV is in an early stage, and there is presently no solution to detection of the GOOSE and SMV related error, anomaly and intrusion. Cyber security technologies for anomaly detection at a substation are in an early stage of development. Technologies to detect anomalies for substation automation multicast protocols and applications are critically needed. This dissertation is concerned with anomaly detection in the computer network environment of a substation. The proposed integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed based on the IEEE 39 and modified IEEE 118 -bus systems. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed impact evaluation method can help operators find the most critical substation among the anomaly detected substations. In addition, the proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations {{of a power}} grid.

40|$|Transmission {{lines are}} {{generally}} protected by distance relays. Most distance protection relays presently available use microprocessor technology. They estimate fundamental frequency phasors from the quantized values of {{voltage and current}} samples. The relays use filters that use fixed sample data windows of one cycle of the nominal frequency. Therefore, the transient response of the filter is about one cycle and the estimated impedances do not converge before this time. However, {{it is possible to}} use different lengths of data windows at different sampling instants and improve the transient response. This thesis describes a distance relaying technique, which uses adaptive data window filters. Relay algorithms that use adaptive data window filters and fixed data window filters were also developed and their performances were compared by using data from simulations using the electromagnetic transient program, EMTDC/PSCAD. Results obtained from a sample power system and a part of the SaskPower transmission network are presented. Different operating conditions of these power systems and, faults of different types and at various locations were simulated for performance evaluation. It was observed from the simulation results that the seen impedances obtained using the adaptive and fixed data window techniques converged to the same values. The results indicated that the convergence of the seen impedance was significantly faster when the algorithm using the adaptive data window technique was used. Selected results are presented in the thesis. The adaptive data window technique and the fixed data window technique were implemented to form prototype distance relays using a general-purpose relay. The hardware and software constituents of the relay are presented in this thesis. The relays were tested using the Real-Time Playback Simulator (RTPS) for a variety of faults simulated on a part of the SaskPower system using the EMTDC/PSCAD program. The procedure for testing the relay by using a playback simulator is reported [...] The test results indicated that the relays operated correctly for all the faults simulated inside the protection zone and did not issue a <b>trip</b> <b>command</b> for the outside faults. The test results also confirmed that the adaptive data window-based relay is able to issue trip commands in lesser time compared to the time taken by the fixed data window-based relay, while the impedances computed by both relays converged to the same values.

40|$|Modern {{distance}} relays have integrated numerous protection functions including power-swing blocking and out-of-step or pole-slip tripping functions. The {{main purpose}} of the power-swing blocking function is to differentiate faults from power swings and block distance or other relay elements from operating during stable or unstable power swings. Most power-swing blocking elements are based on traditional methods that monitor {{the rate of change}} of the positivesequence impedance. The required settings for the power-swing blocking elements could be difficult to calculate in many applications, particularly those where fast swings can be expected. For these cases, extensive stability studies are necessary to determine the fastest rate of possible power swings. This paper describes a zero-setting power-swing blocking protection method that is independent of network parameters and is based on monitoring the line swing-center voltage rate of change. The new method does not require any stability studies or user settings for the proper blocking of relay elements that are prone to operate during stable or unstable power swings. The method is applicable to long, heavily loaded transmission lines that pose great problems in the application of power-swing blocking elements based on traditional methods. This new method offers a great advantage in its ability to detect three-phase faults that may occur during power swings and allows the protective relays to issue a <b>tripping</b> <b>command</b> and isolate the faulted power system element. In this paper, we discuss other enhancements in the design of power-swing blocking and out-of-step tripping functions that improve the security and reliability of the power system.
