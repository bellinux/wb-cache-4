5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E

5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated {{that a third of}} all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> Plasmodium, {{a female}} Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host {{such as a}} human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, {{at which point the}} cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E

5|$|Humans regard certain insects as pests, {{and attempt}} to control them using {{insecticides}} {{and a host of}} other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or fruits.

Insect pollinators are essential to <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere (including humans) would be devastated.

5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> a product.

The reasons to use LCA arose from {{the need to have}} a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> A.gallica {{includes}} two diploidization–haploidization events. The {{first of these}} is the usual process of cell fusion (forming a diploid) followed by meiosis during the formation of haploid basidiospores. The second event is more cryptic, and occurs before fruit body formation. In most basidiomycetous fungi, the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two-nucleate, or dikaryotic stage; this stage is not observed in Armillaria species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a genetic mosaic. These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased genetic diversity, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, like drought.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> Chirocephalus diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast. The typical duration {{of a full}} life cycle is not known, but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested. The eggs are tolerant to drying out; when their habitat fills with water again, some of the eggs will hatch, while others remain dormant. This enables the species to continue to survive in an unpredictable habitat, since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not persist for {{long enough for the}} animals to mate and produce offspring. Dispersal between bodies of water can occur through the movements of animals such as cattle, deer and horses.|$|E
