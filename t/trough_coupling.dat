40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the numerical simulation of a rare, high-latitude hail storm observed during the CAGES (Canadian GEWEX Enhanced Study) field experiment. On 11 May 1999, a shortwave trough moved northward from British Columbia and continued its passage over the Northwest Territories. A hail storm developed {{in an environment of}} small convective available potential energy. To understand the processes responsible for the formation of the storm, the Canadian Mesoscale Compressible Community Model (MC 2) is used to simulate the case. The addition of a second soil type to the lower boundary of the model allows for a realistic simulation of the location and time of the storm. The results indicate that the dynamics associated with the shortwave <b>trough,</b> <b>coupled</b> with diurnal heating effects over the more realistic soil type, produced the weakly-forced hail storm that passed directly over Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories...|$|R

Chapter 2 then discusses the use of vibrational spectroscopy to probe the short range conformational order present in a series of Langmuir films at the air-water interface. Finally, the use of vibrational spectroscopy to probe the long range conformational order in a bulk polymer, poly(β-hydroxybutyrate) is {{presented in}} Chapter 3. ^ Using external reflection infrared spectroscopy, we were able to directly characterize the structure of series of 2 ̆ 2 hairy-rod 2 ̆ 2 polymers at the air-water interface. The overall structure of the films were related to the short range conformational order of long side groups attached to the rigid-rod backbones. The structure of the films were also studied as a function of surface packing density at the air-water interface by the use of a Langmuir <b>trough</b> <b>coupled</b> directly to the external reflection infrared spectroscopy setup. ^ A Raman active longitudinal acoustic mode capable of probing the long range conformational order associated with crystalline regions was discovered for the biodegradable thermoplastic, poly(β-hydroxybutyrate).

The Heisenberg chain {{is one of the}} simplest quantum chains which exhibits a reach entanglement feature, due to the Heisenberg interaction is quantum coupling in the spin system. The two particles were <b>coupled</b> <b>trough</b> XYZ <b>coupling</b> or simply called as two-qubit XYZ spin, which are the responsible for the emergence of thermal entanglement. These two-qubit operators are bonded to two nodal Ising spins, and this process is repeated infinitely resulting in a diamond chain structure. We will discuss two-qubit thermal entanglement effect on Ising-XYZ diamond chain structure. The concurrence could be obtained straightforwardly in terms of two-qubit density operator elements, using this result, we study the thermal entanglement, as well as the threshold temperature where entangled state vanishes. The present model displays a quite unusual concurrence behavior, such as, the boundary of two entangled regions becomes a disentangled region, this is intrinsically related to the XY-anisotropy in the Heisenberg coupling. Despite a similar property had been found for only two-qubit, here we show in the case of a diamond chain structure, which reasonably represents real materials. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Only {{recently}} has external reflectance infrared spectroscopy {{been used to}} acquire structural information {{at the molecular level}} at air-liquid interfaces, and particularly to characterize in situ molecular chains adsorbed at the air-water interface. This technique has been applied for the determination of chain orientation, chain conformation and packing density of small molecules such as phospholipids, fatty acids and fatty alcohols on the surface of water, and more recently of macromolecular systems. Vibrational spectroscopy, a nondestructive technique, is especially successful in the determination of the conformational order or disorder of alkyl chains (e. g. trans/gauche ratio) {{as well as in the}} evaluation of coil, helical or extended conformations in poly(amino acids). ^ In this thesis work, the construction of a microcomputer controlled Langmuir <b>trough</b> optically <b>coupled</b> to a FT-IR instrument has allowed the direct investigation of molecular films spread at air-liquid interfaces.

The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the performance of an efficient solar cooling system for Athens, the most populated city in Greece. The examined solar cooling system is a one stage water/lithium-bromide absorption chiller driven by a parabolic <b>trough</b> collector <b>coupled</b> with a storage tank. A numerical model is developed in order to simulate the dynamic performance of this system. Many parameters have been investigated through sensitivity analyses and their optimum values are determined. The mass flow rates and the storage tank volume are the parameters that have been examined parametrically. The final results proved that by using a PTC module with an aperture area of 14 m 2, a building area of about 25 m 2 can be cooled for 13 h daily during the summer period. The optimum specific mass flow rate was determined to 0. 03 kg/sm 2 and the optimum storage tank volume to 0. 3 m 3.

All the systems are evaluated during a summer cooling season by the energetic and economic point of view by dynamic simulation for two different climates. For Milan (Cfb climate) the highest OSE (overall system efficiency) is reached by LiBr (lithiumbromide) double effect absorption chiller driven by parabolic through collector (0. 53).

Some Small-Scale plants have already been developed, like the 25 - 30 kWe Dish-Stirling engine. Other ones are under development as, for example, plants based on Parabolic <b>Trough</b> Collectors <b>coupled</b> with Organic Rankine Cycles. Furthermore, the technological progress achieved {{in the development of}} new small high-temperature solar receiver, makes possible the development of interesting systems based on Micro Gas Turbines coupled with Dish collectors. Such systems could have several advantages in terms of costs, reliability and availability if compared with Dish-Stirling plants. In addition, Dish-Micro Gas Turbine systems are expected to have higher performance than Solar Organic Rankine Cycle plants. The present work focuses the attention on some challenging aspects related to the design of small high-temperature solar receivers for Dish-Micro Gas Turbine systems. Natural fluctuations in the solar radiation can reduce system performance and damage seriously the Micro Gas Turbine. To stabilize the system operation, the solar receiver has to assure a proper thermal inertia. Therefore, a solar receiver integrated with a short-term storage system based on high-temperature phase-change materials is proposed in this paper. Steady-state and transient analyses (for thermal storage charge and discharge phases) have been carried out using the commercial CFD code Ansys-Fluent. Results are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In early March of 2002, a massively-parallel-vector supercomputer, the Earth Simulator, {{came into}} operation, {{providing}} {{a unique opportunity}} to perform simulations of the general circulation of the global atmosphere with horizontal resolution of about 10 km. We employ a general circulation model called “AFES” that has been fully optimized to the unique architecture of the Earth Simulator, to attain extremely high com-putational efficiency. The ultra-high resolution global simulations with AFES are able to explicitly represent interaction among planetary, synoptic and meso-scale phenomena and the topographic modulation of mesoscale precipitation without the need to nest a regional mesoscale model. Examples are presented of win-tertime extratropical cyclogenesis in the North Pacific, a polar low over the Sea of Japan, pre-summer Baiu frontal zone over Japan and typhoon evolution over the western North Pacific, to show that mesoscale precip-itation systems and their interactions with synoptic and planetary scale flows and topography are indeed sim-ulated in a fairly realistic manner.

The approach {{is based on}} second-order accurate finite volume method with collocated variable arrangement and pressure-velocity <b>coupling</b> <b>trough</b> SIMPLE algorithm. The main objective is the attenuation of spurious pressure field oscillations in regions with discontinuity in grid line slopes, as encountered in grids representing highly non-uniform terrains.

Gauss-Seidel) to initial grid node positions resulting from algebraic grid generators. Drawbacks of previous approaches which ignored treatment of finite volume grid cell cases with intersection point offset in non-orthogonality corrections are removed.

40|$|International audienceThe rapid {{intensification}} of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Dora (2007, southwest Indian Ocean) under upper-level trough forcing is investigated. TC-trough interaction is simulated using a limited-area operational {{numerical weather prediction}} model.

The three-dimensional potential vorticity structure associated with the trough undergoes strong deformation as it approaches the storm. Potential vorticity (PV) is advected toward the tropical cyclone core over a thick layer from 200 to 500 hPa while the TC upper-level flow turns cyclonic from the continuous import of angular momentum. It is found that vortex intensification first occurs inside the eyewall and results from PV superposition in the thick aforementioned layer.

40|$|Microalgae and {{cyanobacteria}} has <b>trough</b> {{the last}} <b>couple</b> of decades been increasingly {{recognized as a}} valuable source {{of a variety of}} bioactive compounds. Many species have been investigated, but these represent mostly strains from tropic or subtropical areas. Norway has, with its long coastline, access to both temperate and polar waters, and thus a unique opportunity to prospect for marine organisms that might possess novel cold-water adapted properties. Screening for bioactivity is commonly performed in vivo in a bioassay purposefully designed for revealing a defined bioactivity (e. g. fungicide or antibacterial activity). This allows the testing of many crude extracts. The search for new drugs against fungal infections is a major challenge to current research in mycotic diseases. In this Thesis a new method (bioassay) targeting spore swelling and germination to assess antifungal susceptibility is developed and evaluated. Traditionally, antifungal activity has been investigated using disk diffusion assays or micro-well plates. Inhibition is measured as a function of radial growth, inhibition zone or turbidity. Construction of a bioassay composed of germinating fungal spores bears the prospect of being a more rapid method, allowing more extracts to be screened within a shorter time frame. It also can be used to reveal antifungal action at an early state in the prospecting by the mode of its action on the spores. A strain of Absidia glauca Hagem served as model organism. A Beckman Coulter Multizisertm 3 particle analyser was applied for the determination of bioactivity and investigation of the sporangiospores. Effects of crude extracts from different microalgae were investigated as changes in volumes of, or as a decreased germination rate rather than percentage of germinating spores. 21 microalgae (15 different marine Chlorophytes, 5 selected Artic and Antarctic terrestrial Cyanobacteria, and 1 additional Chlorophyte isolate of unknown origin) were cultivated for the production of biomass, harvested and extracted (hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts), and screened for antifungal activity. Among these a strain of Phormidium sp. (NIVA 209) proved to be an interesting candidate for fungicide effects. Several hydrophilic extracts improved germination rates. The method was concluded to be a suitable contender for the detection of bioactivities. These results supports that suppression of spore swelling provides early indication of preservative potential and the type of swelling curve produced indicates the mechanism of fungistasis...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this PhD thesis research is to characterize, understand and ultimately control phase-separated structures in mixed films consisting of a perfluorinated fatty acid and a photopolymerizable surfactant. In these systems, film morphology, mechanical properties and spectroscopic properties are inter-related and this thesis explores these relationships. In this context the interaction between perfluorotetradecanoic acid (C 13 F 27 COOH, referred to as PF in this dissertation), and 10, 12 -pentacosadynoic acid (CH 3 (CH 2) 11 −C≡C−C≡C−(CH 2) 8 COOH, referred to as PCDA in this dissertation) has been studied in monolayers {{using a combination of}} surface and spectroscopic characterization techniques. To investigate the inter-relationship of the properties described above, film behavior under a variety of conditions, including behavior at different interfaces (solid-liquid, air-liquid), different film compositions and under different conditions of photoillumination and mechanical stress were explored. Thermodynamic and morphological studies of mixed monolayer surfactant films of PF and the photo-polymerizable diacetylene molecule, PCDA, were carried out. The films were prepared at the air-water interface and transferred onto solid supports such as a glass slides via Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition technique. The presence of the perfluoroacid helped to stabilize the diacetylene surfactant monolayer in comparison with the diacetylene alone, allowing film transfer onto solid substrates without needing to add cations to the sub-phase or photo-polymerize the components prior to deposition. Addition of the perfluorocarbon to PCDA resulted in films with the photopolymer strands oriented perpendicular to the direction of the film compression in a Langmuir trough. This is in contrast with film structures formed from pure PCDA. Formation of these features could be explained by a two-step process that happened sequentially: first, the compression of monolayer with trough barriers while trying to maintain the surface pressure constant induces stress on the film surface; second, additional film buckling which was enhanced by the strong cohesion between PF and PCDA. Film compression data, supported by in situ fluorescence spectrophotometry, Brewster angle microscope imaging and atomic force microscope images of deposited films, supported this mechanism. Factors that controlled the orientation of the photopolymer fibers were also investigated. Fibers were found to consist of multiple strands, with each strand having a different orientation. Our investigation also revealed there was a preferred orientation for fibers in the film as a whole. The angle of approximately 60 o to the direction of film compression during deposition from a Langmuir trough has been calculated with the help of dual-view, polarized fluorescence microscopy. This orientation was attributed to the mechanical stress exerted by the <b>trough</b> compression barriers <b>coupled</b> with rotation of the polymer fibers during film draining. The combination of Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) provided a thorough and comprehensive mapping of fundamental properties of mixed monolayer system, and enabled a quantitative determination of the degree of selectivity of the polymerization process...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{synthesis}} of transition and/or metal iron ferrite systems (both in the spinel MFe 2 O 4 and perovskite MFeO 3 form) through wet-chemistry synthetic routes was explored. Three specific routes were employed: i) nonaqueous sol-gel synthesis, ii) coprecipitation of oxalates from an aqueous solution and iii) hydrothermal synthesis coupled with oxalate coprecipitation. All three routes successfully allowed to synthesise iron ferrites (though the nature and characteristics of the prepared compounds varied depending on the chosen method). The spinel ferrites CoFe 2 O 4, MgFe 2 O 4, MnFe 2 O 4, NiFe 2 O 4 and ZnFe 2 O 4, {{as well as the}} perovskites MnFeO 3 and SrFeO 3 -δ were obtained as crystalline powders. All powders (except MgFe 2 O 4) were obtained as pure, single-phase compounds. The obtained materials were then characterised through a wide array of techniques from the compositional, structural and functional points of view. In particular, bulk atomic ratios were investigated <b>trough</b> ICP-AES (Inductively <b>Coupled</b> Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) and compared with surface composition explored through XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy). TGA-DSC (ThermoGravimetric Analysis-Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and microanalysis allowed to study the evolution of the system during calcination and to evaluate the presence of residual organic moieties (from {{the synthesis}} precursors) in the materials. XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) and TPXRD (Temperature-Programmed XRD) were employed to investigate powder structure and to calculate average crystallite sizes (through Rietveld refinement), and the data thus obtained was compared with micrographs collected through TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). In parallel, XPS, Mössbauer spectroscopy and TPR (Temperature Programmed Reduction) afforded information on the oxidation states and chemical environments of the elements in the material (both in bulk and on the surface). In the case of spinel ferrites, Mössbauer spectroscopy was particularly useful as it allowed to calculate the degree of inversion of the compounds. From a functional point of view, SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) measurements were employed to study the magnetic properties of the materials, revealing that the cobalt and manganese spinels displayed ferrimagnetic behaviour (as expected), whereas the manganese perovskite was paramagnetic above 35 K (Néel temperature) and displayed ferrimagnetic behaviour below that temperature. Electric characterisations to gain insight on the conduction properties of the materials were carried out through BES (Broadband Electric Spectroscopy). These measurements revealed relaxations at 30 and 90 °C in the cobalt and nickel spinels which are compatible with water intercalation within the crystal structure. As far as the manganese perovskite is concerned, the relaxations at 100 °C and higher conductivity displayed compared to the spinels are compatible with ionic conduction. The catalytic activity was investigated through temperature-programmed oxidation of methane (CH 4 -TPO), showing that the synthesised cobalt, manganese, magnesium and nickel ferrites were active in the oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide, despite not being stable over several cycles. The effect of synthetic parameters (such as nature of the precursors, additives, thermal treatment parameters, aging time etc.) on the final structural and compositional nature of the oxides was the object of particular interest. Based upon the results obtained from these investigations, the synthetic protocols for each route were optimised in order to maximise product purity and yield, as well as to improve synthetic conditions; in particular, efforts were made to lower treatment temperatures and shorten treatment times whilst suffering no losses in terms of product yield and quality. In particular, hydrothermal syntheses of the nickel, cobalt, zinc and manganese spinels were successfully carried out at 75 °C with a 4 hour treatment. In addition, the possible application of the coprecipitation of oxalates from an aqueous solution method to prepare iron ferrites containing two metals was explored: the Co 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4, Co 0. 5 Mg 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 and Co 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 FeO 3 systems were successfully prepared and characterised. Measurement of bulk atomic ratios between the three metals in each mixed-metal ferrite (i. e. Co, Fe and either Mg or Mn) revealed that the chosen synthetic route afforded good control over the final stoichiometry of the prepared material...|$|R
