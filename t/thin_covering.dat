25|$|The {{region is}} crossed by the Colorado River with several {{man-made}} lakes, {{known as the}} Highland Lakes, along its length. Because the hills to the west are primarily limestone rock with a <b>thin</b> <b>covering</b> of topsoil, the western portions of the area are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms.

2500|$|Bacteria {{produce a}} single {{endospore}} internally. The spore is sometimes {{surrounded by a}} <b>thin</b> <b>covering</b> known as the exosporium, which overlies the spore coat. The spore coat, which acts like a sieve that excludes large toxic molecules like lysozyme, is resistant to many toxic molecules and may also contain enzymes {{that are involved in}} germination. The cortex lies beneath the spore coat and consists of peptidoglycan. The core wall lies beneath the cortex and surrounds the protoplast or core of the endospore. The core contains the spore chromosomal DNA which is encased in chromatin-like proteins known as SASPs (small acid-soluble spore proteins), that protect the spore DNA from UV radiation and heat. [...] The core also contains normal cell structures, such as ribosomes and other enzymes, but is not metabolically active.|$|E

2500|$|Rush believed, as {{did so many}} {{physicians}} of the time, that {{bleeding and}} active purging with mercury(I) chloride (calomel) were the preferable medical treatments for insanity, a fact evidenced by his statement that, [...] "It is sometimes difficult to prevail upon patients in this state of madness, or even to compel them, to take mercury {{in any of the}} ways in which it is usually administered. [...] In these cases I have succeeded, by sprinkling a few grains of calomel daily upon a piece of bread, and afterwards spreading over it, a <b>thin</b> <b>covering</b> of butter." [...] While Rush followed the standard procedures of bleeding and treatment with mercury, he did not believe that [...] "coercion" [...] and [...] "restraint", the physical punishment, chains and dungeons, which were the practice of the time, were the answer. For this reason, some aspects of his approach could be seen as similar to Moral Therapy, which would soon rise to prominence in at least the wealthier institutions of Europe and the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his desire}} to become a saint, Dominic {{attempted}} to perform physical penances, like making his bed uncomfortable with small stones and pieces of wood, sleeping with a <b>thin</b> <b>covering</b> in winter, wearing a hair shirt, and fasting on bread and water. When his superiors (i.e., John Bosco, or his Rector, or his confessor) came to know this, they forbade him from doing bodily mortification, as it would affect his health. John Bosco told Dominic that as a schoolboy, the best penance would be to perform all his duties with perfection and humility, and that obedience was the greatest sacrifice. Thus, Dominic formed {{an important aspect of}} his philosophy of life, which was, in his words, [...] "I can't do big things but I want everything to be for the glory of God." [...] Don Bosco notes that from that time on, Dominic did not complain about the food or the weather, unlike some other boys at the Oratory, [...] bore all suffering cheerfully, and practised custody of his eyes and tongue. Eugenio Ceria, a Salesian commentator on the autobiography of John Bosco, (Memoirs of the Oratory of Saint Francis de Sales) notes that by this time, owing to his experience as an educator, John Bosco's ideas on several pedagogical and spiritual principles were well developed and linked and this led him to associate the fulfillment of daily duties with holiness in his advice to Savio.|$|E
2500|$|The {{king penguin}} has an unusually {{prolonged}} breeding cycle, taking some 14–16 months from laying to offspring fledging. Although pairs {{will attempt to}} breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial pattern on South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They {{then return to the}} sea for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. [...] The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white egg weighing 300g (⅔lb). It is initially soft, but hardens and darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around [...] The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6–18days each. Hatching may take up to 2–3days to complete, and chicks are born semi-altricial and nidicolous. In other words, they have only a <b>thin</b> <b>covering</b> of down and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. The guard phase starts with the birth of the chick. The young chick spends its time balanced on its parents' feet, sheltered by a pouch formed from the abdominal skin of the latter. During this time, the parents alternate every 3–7days, one guarding the chick while the other forages. The guard phase lasts for 30–40 days. By then the chick has grown much bigger, can keep itself warm and protect itself against most predators. It becomes more curious and starts to explore its surroundings. It ends up forming a group with other chicks, a so-called crèche. Crèches are guarded by only a few adult birds; most parents can leave their chick to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring.|$|E
