5|$|In 1889, Huxley wrote:Therefore, {{although}} it be, as I believe, demonstrable {{that we have}} no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.|$|E
5|$|Male {{students}} and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings, but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> {{could have been done}} to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.|$|E
5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> they could do would keep the book from being treated as pornography.|$|E

5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a second trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E
5|$|As {{the torch}} bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, {{picks up the}} torch, and completes the run to light the Olympic Flame. The heat of the flame and the emotion of the crowd power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} each 20 minute meal in {{the dining}} hall, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and {{carefully}} counted to ensure <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> had been taken as a potential weapon. In the earlier years as a prison, prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, but this was later relaxed, provided that the prisoners communicated quietly.|$|E

5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E
5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> can possibly {{go wrong with}} the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E

But <b>that's</b> <b>nothing!</b> A man who has saved my life once and that I passed my word to would think I had thrown him over. But <b>that's</b> <b>nothing!</b> Listen! As true as I stand here in my boat talking to you, I believe the girl would die of grief." ...|$|R

5|$|On 5 March 2012, {{prior to}} release, Kolkata Metro {{authorities}} objected to {{a scene in}} which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> in the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, and the scene was retained, although it was removed from trailers.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> had been heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that {{in the minds of the}} authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E
5|$|One man, whose {{influence}} {{more than}} any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school. He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting his hard earned knowledge. Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> could stop its growth.|$|E

5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target runtime was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed {{the task of}} shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> could possibly be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.|$|E
5|$|The first European dogs seen {{were those}} that {{accompanied}} Spanish explorers Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira and Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in 1595. While {{they were on}} Hiva Oa, the Marquesans attempted to steal {{one of the small}} dogs on their ships. Anthropologist Katharine Luomala noted <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> suggested that these dogs were left by the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done <b>that,</b> <b>nothing</b> can make me go back.|$|E

5|$|The {{museum is}} {{constructed}} from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres {{above the ground}} on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; {{the idea was to}} keep the surfaces plain so <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> could distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.|$|E
5|$|The second {{safeguard}} clause was a commitment <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> {{should be done}} which might prejudice {{the rights of the}} Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The original drafts of Rothschild, Balfour, and Milner did not include this safeguard, which was drafted together with the preceding safeguard in early October, in order to reflect opposition from influential members of the Anglo-Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} slavery is {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.|$|E
