40|$|The {{intervention}} in NORCCAP was sigmoidoscopy {{alone or with}} an FOBT, but because no additional cancers or adenomas were detected with addition of a single FOBT, the intervention could be considered mainly sigmoidoscopy. The trial has particular strengths: Participants were sampled from the population, and the control group received virtually no screening. NORCCAP is 1 of 4 large RCTs (1 - 3) comparing screening sigmoidoscopy with usual care. The 4 trials reported remarkably similar reductions in both CRC incidence (18 % to 23 %) and CRC mortality (22 % to 31 %). Such agreement is unusual, even among well-conducted trials, particularly given the substantial differences across the trials in CRC prevalence, willingness to be screened, <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> <b>follow-up</b> colonoscopy, and unplanned screening among controls. The effects of screening seemed to be robust enough not to be strongly affected by these differences...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to verify the {{indicated}} maximum entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) using a GE Innova IGS 520 imaging system during cardiac interventional procedures. Gafchromic XR RV 3 films {{were used for the}} patient measurements to monitor the maximum ESAK. The films were scanned and calibrated to measure maximum ESAK. Thermoluminescent dosemeters were used to measure the backscatter factor from an anthropomorphic thorax phantom. The measured backscatter factor, 1. 53, was in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations but higher than the one used by the imaging system, 1. 20. The median of the ratio between indicated maximum ESAK and measured maximum ESAKwas 0. 68. In this work, the indicated maximum ESAK by the imaging system’s dose map model underestimates the measured maximum ESAK by 32 %.

40|$|ObjectivesServing as {{the basis}} for {{implementation}} of several national AAA screening programmes, four large randomised controlled trials provided evidence of a reduction in AAA mortality by ultrasound-based screening among elderly men. Recently, reports of falling AAA prevalence and mortality unrelated to AAA screening have emerged, coinciding with major additional epidemiological changes in the population, as well as improvements in AAA repair. These recent changes may individually, and in concert, affect the rationality of AAA screening. The aim of this paper was to present an up-to-date review of AAA-screening {{within the context of a}} rapidly changing AAA epidemiology. MethodsTopical review of the literature focusing mainly on randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, and contemporary observational AAA-screening studies. ConclusionsSummarising RCT results and recent studies; contemporary one-time screening of men for AAA appears highly cost-effective, and seems to remain an effective preventive health-measure. However, several issues regarding screening need to be addressed: most importantly; the current degree of incidental detection of AAAs, the <b>threshold</b> diameter <b>for</b> <b>follow-up,</b> targeted screening in risk groups, and the possible need for re-screening in an elderly population with ever increasing longevity...|$|R

30|$|Increased program integrity, while {{appropriate}} for Social Security from a fiduciary perspective, may {{also increase the}} number of people requiring other supports. Overall, our findings imply that a substantial percentage of former beneficiaries are able to re-enter the labor force after their benefits cease; however, a not-inconsequential minority of those with earnings do not meet common thresholds of earnings sufficiency and are not able to maintain their earnings over time. Additionally, almost one quarter of former beneficiaries have no earnings after cessation, and few ceased individuals maintain employment above our measured earnings <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> the entire <b>follow-up</b> period. Given the high probability of return and the generally poor labor market outcomes of many ceased beneficiaries, analyses of the relationship between SSA’s CDR policy and the broader social safety net may be in order. Others have shown that spousal employment, other government programs, and asset spend-down are ways some individuals cope with waiting for a DI award (Coe et al. 2014, Lindner 2013, Bound et al. 2003). Whether these sources of support are available after program cessation is unknown. Similarly, access to and use of health insurance has changed substantially in recent years. This may have improved individuals’ health, resulting in an increased ability to work or willingness to work, and the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the employment of former beneficiaries is an important area for future research.|$|R

The revised guidelines incorporate several substantive changes that reflect current thinking on the management of small nodules. The minimum <b>threshold</b> size <b>for</b> routine <b>follow-up</b> has been increased, and recommended follow-up intervals are now given as a range {{rather than as a}} precise time period to give radiologists, clinicians, and patients greater discretion to accommodate individual risk factors and preferences. The guidelines for solid and subsolid nodules have been combined in one simplified table, and specific recommendations have been included for multiple nodules. These guidelines represent the consensus of the Fleischner Society, and as such, they incorporate the opinions of a multidisciplinary international group of thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, pathologists, and other specialists.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess if core {{temperature}} <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> exercise ventilation differ between sites of core temperature measurement during an incremental exercise test from rest to the point of exhaustion. It was hypothesized that the core temperature <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (VE/VO 2),measured with ingestible pill temperature, would not be different from the oesophageal temperature and tympanic membrane temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2. METHODS: Four females volunteered for this study that was approved by the SFU Office of Research Ethics. Two of the female volunteers were amenorrheic and the other two were in follicular phase of their menstrual cycles. The results were then compared to four males VE/VO 2 oesophageal (TOES) and tympanic membrane (TTY) temperature thresholds from a published study. Each volunteer after a 24 h reflection period, signed a medical history form, a PAR-Q, as well as gave their signed informed consent. Core temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> exercise ventilation were assessed with an ingestible pill temperature (TPILL) sensor, with a TOES probe and with TTY probe. Minute ventilation (VE) and volume of consumed oxygen (VO 2) were quantified by indirect calorimetry. Vieth threshold software was employed to determine the core temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2. An unpaired, two-tailed t-test was used to compare the core temperature <b>thresholds</b> <b>for</b> exercise ventilation. The P value was set at 0. 05. RESULTS: The TPILL <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2 of 37. 1 ± 0. 4 °C(mean±SD) showed a trend (p= 0. 06) to be lower than the TES <b>threshold</b> <b>for</b> VE/VO 2 of 37. 5 ± 0. 2 °C. No difference was evident between TPILL threshold and TTY threshold of 37. 03 ± 0. 2 °C for VE/VO 2.

40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} {{trials have}} demonstrated that mortality from Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) can be cost-effectively reduced by ultrasound-screening of men. Evidence for screening women is insufficient. Reports of falling AAA incidence are emerging. In an effort to study screening for AAA in a contemporary setting, two cross-sectional multi-centre population-based studies of one-time screening of 65 -year-old men, and 70 -year-old women in Middle Sweden were undertaken. Cost-efficiency of one-time screening of 65 -year-old men was evaluated in a decision-analysis model. Five-year outcomes in men invited to screening at age 65 and age 70, were studied in a longitudinal cohort study. A lower than expected (1. 7 %) prevalence of AAA in 65 -year-old men was found, {{as well as a}} very low (0. 4 %) prevalence in 70 -year-old women. Smoking was the dominating risk factor associated with AAA, but the association was stronger in women. The main cause of reduced contemporary prevalence was falling smoking rates in the population since 30 years. One-time screening of 65 -year-old men was found to be cost-effective and deliver significant clinical impact. The cost per quality adjusted life-year gained, at 13 -years follow-up, was € 14706, which was below the recommended UK NICE threshold of € 25000. 15 lives were saved by inviting 10000 to screening. Prevalence of AAA and the rate of incidental detection of AAAs in the population were important factors affecting cost-efficiency. New AAAs developed after 5 years in men screened normal at age 65, predominantly in men with sub-aneurysmal aortas (25 - 29 mm) at 65, and smokers. The 5 -year rate of AAA repair was high among men with screening detected AAAs, as was non-AAA related mortality. Ruptures were only documented among non-attenders. Conclusions: A lower than expected prevalence of AAA among 65 -year-old men, an unchanged repair rate, and improved longevity of the elderly population was found. Although one-time screening for AAA was still cost-effective within a contemporary context, several issues need to be addressed; the <b>threshold</b> diameter <b>for</b> <b>follow-up,</b> the current rate of opportunistic detection of AAA in the population, re-screening of the entire population at a higher age, and targeted screening of smokers.
