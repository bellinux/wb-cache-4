40|$|This article {{considers}} the English and Chinese laws {{relating to the}} insurerâ��s primary obligation and the consequences for non-performance of the obligation. English law characterises an insurerâ��s primary obligation as a duty to "hold the insured harmless" against the insured event {{and there is no}} damage <b>for</b> late <b>payment</b> of insurance claims. Chinese law requires the insurer to pay valid claims in a timely manner and also sets out <b>time-limits</b> <b>for</b> an insurer to assess and pay claims. The strengths in setting out such time-limits and the difficulties without such time-limits are discussed. This article also considers how Chinese courts interpret and apply these time-limits. Finally, suggestions are made on further improvement of Chinese law and of the Law Commissionsâ�� recommendation that insurers should have an obligation to pay valid claims "within a reasonable time"...|$|R

40|$|Thesis Abstract The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, which {{was adopted by}} the Regulation No. 1896 / 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (ES) {{creating}} a European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, adopted on 12 December 2006. This thesis describes events preceding the adoption of the Regulation, the procedure of adoption of the Regulation, as well as, development of the content of individual provisions of the Regulation and the content of the actual adopted and binding Regulation. In this thesis, the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure is also compared with nati- onal orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures in the Czech Republic, France and Germany. The selection of these three countries was not unintentional. The Czech Republic was chosen because the thesis was written in the Czech language, in the Czech Republic and shall also be published in the Czech Republic, therefore the author believes the majority of potential readers know the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> better than any other order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure. This aspect was also the main reason why the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> is described {{at the beginning of this}} thesis. The German and French orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures were chosen because the European Commission claims the French " injonction de payer" and the German " [...] ...|$|R
