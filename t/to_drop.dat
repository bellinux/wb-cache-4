5|$|Although it {{is unknown}} when it was opened, Loring was host to a Conventional Enhanced Release Training bomb range, which was located {{adjacent}} to the runway. Loring {{was one of four}} Strategic Air Command bases with a range of this type, and it was used frequently. The base was also located next to Condor 1 and Condor 2 airspace, which allowed for low-level training. The routes and training opportunities within the restricted airspace allowed training to be accomplished. One disadvantage of the location of Loring was its distance from the Strategic Training Route Complex and bombing ranges in Nevada and Utah. The ranges out west were the only location where the B-52s were allowed <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> live munitions, although SAC training only required crews <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> live munitions twice a year on these ranges.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{major problem}} in post-harvest {{handling}} of bananas is the individual detachment of the fruit from the hands. This study aimed to establishing the relationship between carbohydrate concentration and enzyme activity in the pedicel region of three cultivars of bananas, resistant and susceptible <b>to</b> natural <b>dropping,</b> during post-harvest ripening, and the susceptibility of bananas <b>to</b> finger <b>dropping.</b> Cultivars ‘Terra’ (plantain, AAB group) and ‘Prata’ (banana, AAB group) triploids and the ‘Prata Graúda’ (banana, AAAB group) tetraploid were used. The experiment was distributed in split plots, with three plots (cultivars) and five subplots (peel color stages) in a completely randomized design with three replications and three fruits per sample unit. ‘Terra’ showed resistance <b>to</b> <b>dropping,</b> even though the fruit were ripe, unlike ‘Prata Graúda’, which, starting from the fifth stage (yellow fruit with green tips), exhibited high susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>dropping.</b> At all ripening stages, the ‘Terra’ had the highest dry mass levels. In turn, the ‘Prata Graúda’ always maintained the lowest levels. The ‘Terra’ showed decreasing levels of pectins during ripening, whereas starch remained high even in the ripe fruit. About the enzymes studied, the results confirmed the increased resistance of the ‘Terra’ <b>to</b> <b>dropping,</b> allowing <b>to</b> conclude that polygalacturonase (PG) and pectinametylesterase (PME) are the key enzymes for the solubilization of the cell wall that accompanies ripening, thus playing {{a critical role in}} inducing natural dropping. The high susceptibility of the ’Prata Graúda’ <b>to</b> <b>dropping</b> is associated with the high activity of PG and PME and the low levels of dry mass; the greater resistance of the ‘Terra’ <b>to</b> <b>dropping</b> is related <b>to</b> higher accumulation of dry mass and starch in the pedicel...|$|R
