5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. <b>The</b> <b>shoot</b> lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{decided to}} film The Frighteners entirely in New Zealand. Zemeckis and Universal {{agreed on the}} {{condition}} that Jackson made New Zealand look similar to the Midwestern United States. Principal photography began on May 14, 1995 and lasted until November 16, {{which is one of the}} longest shooting schedules ever approved by Universal Pictures. Six weeks into <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> cinematographer Alun Bollinger had a serious car accident. His replacement, John Blick, later alternated duties with Bollinger for much of the rest of <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> Location shooting primarily included Wellington and three weeks spent in Lyttelton. Interior scenes were compiled at Camperdown Studios in Miramar.|$|E

5|$|Eyewitnesses {{gathered}} {{direct evidence}} of <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> with video cameras, which were later submitted to and disseminated by media outlets and watched {{hundreds of thousands}} of times in the days following <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> Violent demonstrations occurred protesting <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jackson has {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} remaster the film in 3-D {{at some point in}} the future. Jackson was also seen shooting with a 3-D camera at times during <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> of King Kong.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E
5|$|British journalist, Fuad Omar, wrote {{extensively}} about {{the filming of}} the film in the UK, covering much of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> {{in a series of}} online articles and for regional press. Many of these were reprinted in an unedited format in his book, Bollywood: An Insider's Guide.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>shooting</b> {{also brought}} under {{scrutiny}} {{the use of}} no-knock warrants, which exist to prevent drug offenders from having time to destroy evidence. After <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> <b>the</b> state senate voted to tighten restrictions, {{making it more difficult}} to obtain the warrants. The Atlanta Police Department was also forced to tighten its warrant requirements after an investigation sparked by <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> <b>The</b> police department also said it would review its use of confidential informants after <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> As a result of <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> <b>the</b> police chief placed Atlanta's eight-man narcotics team on administrative leave. A civilian review board was created in the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> in <b>the</b> context of the public outrage that resulted. [...] Eventually, the narcotics team was increased from eight to thirty officers, and all former members of the team were replaced.|$|R
5000|$|The nine-floor {{courthouse}} hosted {{offices for}} U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign. [...] Neither senator received any credible threats before <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> {{a man named}} Nicholas Gramenos recorded a video from few blocks away during <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> <b>The</b> clip was posted on the video-sharing site YouTube under his usernname, [...] "NickyFlips". Several gunshots {{can be heard in}} the video, but <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> itself was not visible. Hours after <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> some local television stations falsely reported multiple gunmen were still at large, leading to the evacuations of several commercial areas surrounding the courthouse. Several media outlets reported conflicting, erroneous information in the hours immediately following <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> <b>The</b> Associated Press first reported at least two federal marshals were shot, and the Las Vegas Sun reported [...] "two or three federal marshals" [...] were wounded. The Las Vegas Review-Journal initially reported two FBI agents were shot.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{beginning}} <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> in {{love with}} Gregor, Renoir's infatuation remained unrequited. During the film's production he ended {{his relationship with his}} common-law wife Marguerite and began another with script girl Dido Freire, whom he had known for twelve years and was Alain Renoir's nanny. Eventually Dido married Renoir.|$|E
5|$|During filming, {{after the}} strike ended, Forster read a spec script by Joshua Zetumer, which he liked, and {{hired him to}} reshape scenes for the later parts of <b>the</b> <b>shoot,</b> which the {{director}} was still unsatisfied with. Forster had the actors rehearse their scenes, as he liked to film scenes continually. Zetumer rewrote dialogue depending on the actors' ideas each day.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Anbe Sivam commenced in July 2002. The {{first scene}} featuring the lead actors {{was shot at}} Pollachi Junction railway station.

50|$|A coroner's inquiry {{conducted}} for <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> of Lim Bock Song ruled on 12 January 2010 that <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> {{was a case}} of justifiable homicide. The man was shot after charging at police officer Azli Othman with a knife. District Judge Yeo ruled <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> was without any criminal intent.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shooting</b> for Zubaan {{began in}} March 2014. A {{major part of}} <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> took place in Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan, while the last phase was shot in Mumbai.

5|$|Saran later {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that during <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> at Coorg, the team's day began at 4:30 AM everyday. She visited coffee plantation and black pepper farms to observe the farmers' work for her part. For a few particular scenes, where Saran teaches Nagarjuna some farm chores, the team made a few takes, as Nagajuna, being a quick learner, completed the tasks better than Saran.|$|E
5|$|Suriname-born Milton Kam, who {{had shot}} 10 feature films {{and more than}} 50 short films, {{was chosen as the}} {{director}} of photography. Since Domalpalli's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio, he was shocked to look through the Super 16mm lens the day they commenced <b>the</b> <b>shoot.</b> However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{flashback}} {{scenes were}} being shot at Chiran Fort Club in Hyderabad till 11 April 2014. The makers preferred Hyderabad to Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan {{for the remaining}} portions and 70% of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> was completed by late April 2014. After filming few portions at Ramoji Film City, the next schedule commenced at Ladakh on 20 May 2014. On its completion, majority of the film's shoot was wrapped up. After completion of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> there, filming continued at Ramoji Film City and Mumbai in June 2014. Some crucial scenes on Mahesh, Sood, and others were filmed there. The next schedule was planned in Bellary and Kerala from 22 June 2014. After its completion, the next schedule commenced in Hyderabad from 6 July 2014.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston, features Beyoncé wearing a modern-day tank top, performing the song against a blank background which changes {{back and forth}} between white and black. Interspersed are some scenes from a photo shoot within her film Dreamgirls. This version appears on the Dreamgirls DVD release. In the director's cut of this version, Beyoncé is seen posing for a photo shoot not featured in the film in which she wears very outlandish clothing. As <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> progresses it becomes more and more evident that Beyoncé is not happy with the direction of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> and when she is handed a bird to pose with she becomes fed up, walks away and strips down to the black tank top and tights underneath. She then climbs the staircase of the building to the rooftop and finishes singing the song.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shooting</b> {{happened}} {{in and around}} Chennai. Most of <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> was happening at night because the story is set {{against the backdrop of}} darkness.|$|R

50|$|On June 15, 2007 ABC-TV's 20/20 program {{broadcast}} a segment about <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> It {{turns out that}} Jessica was four months pregnant with Turner's baby {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> She and <b>the</b> baby both survived <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> apparently because Jessica had a metal plate in her chest due to a childhood accident.|$|R
5|$|The {{root system}} and <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> system are interdependent – the usually non{{photosynthetic}} root system depends on <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system. Cells in each system {{are capable of}} creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, {{such as those of}} willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, {{as is the case with}} Saintpaulia, or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.|$|E
5|$|Aayirathil Oruvan languished in {{development}} hell due to slow progress of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> and the extensive pre- and post-production works, evading release dates ranging one year. Shooting began in July 2007, and {{took place in}} various locations with 2,000 extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and Jaisalmer, Rajasthan amongst other regions throughout India. Uncut, the film runs for over 220 minutes, but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 183 minutes. The film released coinciding with the festival of Thai Pongal on 14 January 2010, with a Telugu dubbing version, titled Yuganikki Okkadu, following six weeks later. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E
50|$|The ruling, however, was {{postponed}} pending {{results of a}} three-dimensional digital re-creation of <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> In November, 1997, Lyga appeared again before <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> board, which reviewed the evidence and the 3D re-creation, and in December LAPD chief Bernard Parks reported that <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> was within department policy; no action would be taken against Lyga.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shooting</b> {{prompted}} <b>the</b> LAPD {{to conduct}} an investigation. <b>The</b> <b>shooting</b> reportedly was reviewed by the district attorney's office, the Police Commission and its independent inspector general.|$|R
