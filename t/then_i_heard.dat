She stated: [...] "When I first read the book, I thought, 'This would be a great film,' and boy was I wrong. It's a much better TV series. Fast forward, I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC, which to me seemed like an odd pairing for this. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it wasn't going forward at NBC so I talked to Frank." [...] On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers; the former wrote the script and directed the episode. The entire series was pre-ordered based on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.|$|E

Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on six {{songs from}} Breakaway. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{included}} as the album's opening and title track. She {{described it as}} a simple song, and further explained, [...] "I think that it's simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E

Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the enormous, infinite scream of nature."

Speaking of [...] "Helter Skelter", he said: [...] "Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' And I had this song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's , [...] "Who You Are", was {{released}} to the US iTunes Store on 22 February 2011. [...] It is the song from the album of which she is proudest. It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.

[...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl. So I looked in the mirror and started to cry and said 'who am I?'

2500|$|.....the virgin {{knelt down}} with great veneration in an {{attitude}} of prayer, and her back was turned to the manger.... And while she was standing thus in prayer, I saw the child in her womb move and suddenly in a moment {{she gave birth to}} her son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle.... I saw the glorious infant lying on the ground naked and shining. His body was pure from any kind of soil and impurity. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> also the singing of the angels, which was of miraculous sweetness and great beauty... After this the Virgin kneels to pray to her child, to be joined by Saint Joseph, and this (technically known as the [...] "Adoration of Christ" [...] or [...] "of the Child") becomes one of the commonest depictions in the 15th century, largely replacing the reclining Virgin in the West.

2500|$|Kenny G has {{attracted}} significant criticism from mainstream jazz musicians and enthusiasts. Pat Metheny {{stated that he}} was a [...] "pop" [...] saxophonist, [...] "but was not really an advanced player, even in that style", adding that he had [...] "major rhythmic problems" [...] and that his [...] "harmonic and melodic vocabulary was extremely limited, mostly to pentatonic based and blues-lick derived patterns". Metheny believes that the main reason why Kenny G has become unpopular and easy to attack by accomplished jazz musicians is due to the [...] "fact that he sells an enormous amount of records while not being anywhere near a really great player in relation to the standards that have been set on his instrument over the past sixty or seventy years". [...] Branford Marsalis once stated in an interview with Jazziz magazine: [...] "When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He's not stealing jazz. The audience he has wouldn't be caught dead at a real jazz concert or club. It's not like some guy says, ‘You know, I used to listen to Miles, 'Trane and Ornette. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Kenny G, and I never put on another Miles record.' It's a completely different audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{about two}} {{minutes left in the}} half, the Dolphins finally managed to get a good drive going on their next possession. Marino {{completed}} seven out of nine passes, the last one being a 30-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose, to reach the 49ers' 12-yard line. However, San Francisco's defense tightened up on the next three plays, forcing two incompletions and a completed pass for no gain, and Miami was forced to settle for von Schamann's second field goal of the game to cut their deficit to 28–13 with 12 seconds left in the half. Then Miami caught a break as the 49ers botched the ensuing kickoff. San Francisco lineman Guy McIntyre received von Schamann's short kick and was about to down the ball, but then changed his mind at the last second and decided to return it. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake; McIntyre fumbled while being leveled by rookie Joe Carter, and Jim Jensen recovered the ball for Miami at the 49ers' 12-yard line. After that, von Schamann kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half, cutting the score to 28–16. [...] "I can laugh about the play now, but it wasn't funny at the time," [...] McIntyre said after the game. [...] "My first instinct when I got the ball was to fall down. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> everyone yelling, 'Get up! Get up!'

Nora Crotty of Elle magazine described the single as an [...] "ode to repenting {{in the morning for}} the foolish mistakes you made the night before".

[...] McCartney's voice can be heard sped up underneath West's opening vocals. McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later speeded up for the finished release, thus causing McCartney's voice to sound much higher than its normal tone.
