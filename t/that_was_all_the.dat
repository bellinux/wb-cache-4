He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> padding he wore.|$|E

In the opener, Kershaw had another strong game, allowing two runs and five hits in eight innings with 13 strikeouts. A solo homer by Justin Turner {{in the top of}} the ninth gave the Dodgers a 3–2 win. Buster Posey hit a walk-off RBI single off of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen the next day as the Giants won 5–4 in 10 innings. Urías struck out seven in the next game, and only allowed two runs, but those were on a two-run homer by Brandon Belt in the 6th and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Giants needed for a 2–1 victory. The Dodgers {{traveled to}} Chase Field for a road series against the Arizona Diamondbacks beginning on June 13. Former Dodger Zack Greinke struck out six over seven innings to beat his old team, 3–2. The Dodgers had two homers from Joc Pederson and solo shots by Justin Turner and Chase Utley as they evened the series with a 7–4 win the next game. A three-run homer by Scott Van Slyke accounted for all the Dodgers runs as the finished off the series with a 3–2 win. Kershaw struck out 11 in 7 innings to pick up his 10th win of the season.|$|E
25|$|William Herschel, {{previously}} a clarinet player, of Bath discovered {{infrared radiation}} on 11 February 1800, {{and the planet}} Uranus in March 1781; he had made important improvements to the reflecting telescope by increasing the mirror diameter. Herschel then built a 20-ft reflecting telescope and invented the star count, working out that the Milky Way was a disc, which he called a grindstone, and the Milky Way was a galaxy but that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> universe contained; he had noticed other nebulas but did not recognise what these were; only when the Hooker telescope was built sufficiently large-enough in California in 1924, did Edwin Hubble realise that these nebulas (Andromeda Galaxy) were other galaxies. The Herschel Space Observatory was launched by ESA in March 2009 to map the Milky Way. Sir Arthur C. Clarke of Minehead invented the idea of artificial satellites; he {{sent a letter to}} Harry Wexler who then developed the first weather satellite TIROS-1. Sir Arthur Eddington of Weston-super-Mare was the first to realise that nuclear fusion powered the Sun; previously the age of Sun was thought to be only 20 million years old, which he knew had to be older than that; at the 1920 British Association meeting he said that the Sun converted hydrogen into helium, but he did not know how, and that mass was lost; nuclear fission was only considered in 1933.

[...] Washington was given the letter, but formally rejected it, as it was not addressed to him by either name or title. However, the letter had the intended effect: when the evacuation began, there was no American fire to hinder the British departure.

500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E

Eduardo Rodríguez was charged with all of the nine runs and was pulled after 2 [...] innings. The Red Sox could only put seven runs on the board while the Rays added another four. A strong outing by Rick Porcello, allowing only one run in six innings, was backed by eight runs of support. Matt Moore held Boston hitless through five innings in the rubber match. In the sixth, the Red Sox could load the bases on three hits with only one out, but David Ortiz and Hanley Ramírez could not drive them in.

So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together.

2500|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} second half of the season where they left off, {{extending}} their winning streak to five with a 6-4 road victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Clayton Kershaw struck out eight in seven innings, allowing four unearned runs in the seventh thanks to a Juan Uribe error and a Xavier Nady home run. Juan Rivera welcomed himself to his new teammates by hitting a home run on the first pitch he saw as a Dodger. The streak ended the next day as Hiroki Kuroda's bad luck continued. He allowed a three-run homer to Brandon Allen, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Diamondbacks needed as they held on for a 3-2 win, despite Matt Kemp's 24th homer of the season. Ted Lilly struck out nine batters in 6 2/3 innings on July 17, but he also gave up two home runs, including one to Diamondbacks pitcher Daniel Hudson. Hudson, meanwhile pitched a complete game, and the only run the Dodgers scored in the 4-1 defeat was on a wild pitch. In the game, Lilly became the first Dodger pitcher since Jeff Weaver in 2005 to allow both 20 homers and 20 steals in a season. The Dodgers next traveled to San Francisco to play the first place Giants. Ryan Vogelsong shut down the Dodgers anemic offense, 5-0, to drop them a season worst 13 1/2 games behind the Giants. It was the Dodgers 10th shutout loss of the season. Hong-Chih Kuo allowed a two-run double to Brandon Belt in the seventh inning to lead the Giants to a 5-3 victory over the Dodgers on July 19. With the offense continuing to sputter, ranking next to last in runs scored in the league, the team fired hitting coach Jeff Pentland on July 20. [...] Assistant hitting coach Dave Hansen was promoted to interim hitting coach for the rest of the season. Clayton Kershaw again snapped the Dodgers losing streak, pitching eight shutout innings while striking out 12 to out duel Giants ace Tim Lincecum on July 20. Dioner Navarro's solo homer into McCovey Cove in the seventh was all the Dodger could muster but it was enough in the 1-0 win.|$|E
