5|$|The Commandos on Campbeltown now disembarked: two assault teams, five {{demolition}} {{teams with}} their protectors and a mortar group. Three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations {{associated with the}} dry dock. The kilt-wearing Captain Donald Roy – 'The Laird' – and his 14-man assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements high above the quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt. Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
5|$|NY18 remains Roosevelt Highway until HamlinParma Town Line Road, {{where is}} becomes West Avenue. In the hamlet of Hamlin, it meets NY19. NY18 passes NY260 before {{swerving}} northward onto West Avenue at the Hamlin–Parma town line and proceeding eastward toward {{the village of}} Hilton. In Hilton, NY18 meets NY259 (Lake Avenue) {{in the center of}} the village. The two routes overlap for a short distance east along Main Street before turning south <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> village on South Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear import {{depends on}} the importin binding its cargo in the {{cytoplasm}} and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.|$|E

5|$|The Western Xia met {{a similar}} fate, {{becoming}} an unreliable vassal to the Mongols by seeking to secure alliances with Jin and Song. Genghis Khan {{had died in}} 1227 during the 5-month siege of their capital city, and being held somewhat responsible for this, the last Xia ruler was hacked to death when he was persuaded <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> gates of his city with a small entourage.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> bloodstream {{at a much}} higher rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|When {{entering}} and exiting at {{the same}} station, users are normally charged a minimum fare ($2.15 / $1.75).

Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Frederick of Prussia's {{invasion}} of Saxony in August 1756 began a Third Silesian War and sparked the wider Seven Years' War. Empress Maria Theresa and Kaunitz wished <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> war with possession of Silesia. Austria was aligned with France and Russia, Great Britain with Prussia and Portugal. Giving Austria huge subsidies {{came back to}} haunt France. It could not bolster defences in New France; the British easily captured Louisbourg in 1758, {{and went on to}} conquer all of New France.|$|E
5|$|I-96 crosses into Ingham County and {{continues}} {{along the southern}} edges of the Lansing metro area. It passes through areas with residential subdivisions and commercial developments, coming {{to a pair of}} interchanges including one for the eastern end of BL I-96 (Cedar Street). Near the crossing of the Red Cedar River, I-96 goes through the interchange for I-496/US127. East of that interchange, the freeway begins <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> metro area as the landscape transitions back to farm fields. I-96 continues eastward, bypassing Williamston and Webberville to the south. Near the latter, the freeway turns more southeasterly and crosses into Livingston County.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Pechersky {{was arrested}} by the Soviet {{authorities}} along with his brother during the countrywide Rootless cosmopolitan campaign against the Jews suspected of pro-Western leanings. Only after Stalin's death in 1953 was he released from jail {{due in part to}} mounting international pressure. However, the harassment did not stop there. Pechersky was prevented by the Soviet government from testifying in multiple international trials related to Sobibor, including the Eichmann Trial in Israel. The last time he was refused the permission <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> country and testify was in 1987, for a trial in Poland.|$|E
5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{disputes}} between Karta and Ladbroke led the British firm <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> project, and its shares were assumed by Alfred Akirov's Alrov company. However, further objections from many sourcesincluding religious groups {{opposed to an}} entertainment area {{so close to the}} Old City and possible operation on the Jewish Sabbathkept construction at a crawl. Both Alrov and Karta accused each other of breach of contract and sued. After years of frozen construction and drawn-out mediation, the Jerusalem district court found parts of both parties' complaints to be justified and ordered 100 million NIS paid to Alrov by Karta, which allowed construction to resume.|$|E

5|$|On February 26, 2016, Media General {{obtained}} a preliminary injunction against Gray {{for violating the}} SSA and JSA, which required that Gray return control of WAGT to Media General, and forbade Gray from selling WAGT in the spectrum incentive auction. The company accused Gray of using the spectrum auction and sale of the station <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> agreements illegitimately, as they were to last through 2020, and apply to any future owner of WAGT. Gray attempted to block the injunction by arguing that its actions were {{required in order to}} comply with the FCC's prohibition of joint sales agreements, but was denied. Media General took back control of WAGT on March 7, 2016.|$|E

The spacewalk attached the U.S.-built Unity node to Zarya. The longest spacewalk was performed on March 11, 2001, when STS-102 crew members Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss conducted a full spacewalk, and then returned to the airlock, but remained in their suits ready <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> airlock again in case the robotics operations ran into problems. The total time for that spacewalk was eight hours and fifty-six minutes.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{activity}} {{continued through}} April and May, with two tropical cyclones {{in the former}} month. In early April, Tropical Cyclone Hansella moved over the island of Rodrigues, dropping more rainfall in 24hours than the average monthly total. Later, Itelle became a rare April intense tropical cyclone, but weakened before it approached St. Brandon island. The final storm of the season, Jenna, formed in the Australian region, briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the south-west Indian Ocean, and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> basin on May4 to end the season. In addition to the named storms, several tropical depressions were tracked, one of which in December dropped heavy rainfall on Réunion.|$|E
