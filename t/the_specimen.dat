5|$|UA 8699 was {{discovered}} in a joint study by Stony Brook University and the University of Antananarivo (UA) {{and placed in the}} collections of the latter as specimen 8699. It was found at a locality named MAD93-95 in the Anembalemba Member of the Maevarano Formation, which is Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The locality is in the Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar. Several other mammals have been recovered from similarly aged Madagascar deposits, but most are also known from very limited material. These include the gondwanathere Lavanify, an indeterminate multituberculate, and a few other indeterminate teeth, as well as a nearly complete skeleton representing an otherwise unknown mammalian lineage. In a 2001 Nature paper, David Krause announced the discovery of UA 8699 and argued for marsupial affinities of <b>the</b> <b>specimen.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> is so fragmentary, he refrained from assigning a new scientific name to the tooth. Two years later, Alexander Averianov, David Archibald, and Thomas Martin favored a placental interpretation in a paper in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, noting that <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> was essentially similar to the zhelestid Lainodon. In a 2006 review of some of the Cretaceous vertebrates of Madagascar, Krause and colleagues continued to consider <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> as a marsupial and announced that an upcoming paper by Case would make the case for marsupial affinities more fully.|$|E

5|$|As {{described}} in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> of Psittacosaurus preserved with integument indicated that the animal was countershaded, likely due to preferring a habitat in dense forests with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent disruptive coloration. <b>The</b> <b>specimen</b> also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large patagia {{on its hind legs}} that connected {{to the base of the}} tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that there might have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of Jehol Formation Psittacosaurus <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out P. mongoliensis, based on hip features.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined <b>the</b> <b>specimen,</b> wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers.

5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>specimen</b> was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted fruit dove or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to}} the distinctiveness of <b>the</b> <b>specimen,</b> particularly in the bare skin around the eye, and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species. It is uncertain where the dove should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black-naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives.

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Brancasaurus brancai is GPMM A3.B4, stored at the University of Münster.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mechanical {{properties}} of concrete specimens containing CuO nano-particles which were cured in saturated limewater have been optimized. CuO nano-particles were partially added to concrete as nano-fillers. <b>The</b> <b>specimens</b> were cured {{in water and}} saturated limewater for 7, 28, and 90 days after casting and then their strengths were evaluated by mechanical tests (compressive, split tensile, and flexural strength tests). The results showed that replacement of Portland cement with CuO nanoparticles up to 1. 0 wt. % for <b>the</b> <b>specimens</b> cured in water and 2. 0 % for <b>the</b> <b>specimens</b> cured in saturated limewater produces concrete with the best strength.

40|$|One of {{the methods}} for {{strengthening}} square concrete columns is shape modification. The method involves modification of the column cross section from square to circular by bonding concrete segments and then wrapping the column with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP). This paper investigates experimentally {{the applicability of the}} shape modification (circularization) for square hollow reinforced concrete (RC) specimens under different loading conditions. Five groups of four hollow RC specimens made from normal strength concrete were cast and tested. <b>The</b> <b>specimens</b> in <b>the</b> first group were RC hollow specimens, which served as reference <b>specimens.</b> <b>The</b> corners of <b>the</b> <b>specimens</b> in <b>the</b> second group were rounded to 20 mm and wrapped with two layers of carbon FRP (CFRP). <b>The</b> <b>specimens</b> in <b>the</b> third group were circularized and wrapped with two layers of CFRP. <b>The</b> <b>specimens</b> in <b>the</b> fourth group were bonded with one CFRP strap longitudinally on each side and then circularized and wrapped with two layers of CFRP. <b>The</b> <b>specimens</b> in <b>the</b> fifth group were wrapped with one layer of CFRP and then circularized and wrapped with two layers of CFRP.
