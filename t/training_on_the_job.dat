2500|$|Wharton wrote {{extensively}} on economic matters, including protective tariffs and business cycles. [...] In {{the last half}} of the 19th century, business education typically consisted mainly of <b>training</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> or an apprenticeship. Wharton conceived of a school that would teach how to develop and run a business, and to anticipate and deal with the cycles of economic activity. In 1881 Wharton donated $100,000 to the University of Pennsylvania to found a [...] "School of Finance and Economy" [...] for this purpose. He specified that the Wharton School faculty advocate economic protectionism, as he had when lobbying for American businesses in Washington. However, the school soon began broaden its outlook to a global one and to teach other disciplines such as politics and the developing social sciences, and introduced the teaching of business management and finance as these disciplines gradually coalesced. The Wharton School was the first to include such a practical focus on business, finance, and management. During its first century through the present day, it was and is widely known as one of the most prominent schools of business in the world.|$|E

50|$|<b>Training</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> was {{described}} as very limited, with the new bouncers being 'thrown into the deep end'—the {{fact that they had}} been accepted for the job in the first place including the assessment that they should know what they are doing (though informal observation of a beginner's behaviour was commonplace). In the case of the British research project, the legally required licensing as a bouncer was also found to be expected by employers before applicants started the job (and as licensing generally excluded people with criminal convictions, this kept out some of the more unstable violent personalities).|$|E

Guitar techs <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> may learn their skills by playing in amateur or semi-professional bands as a guitarist or bassist, working for music stores as a guitar repairperson, for clubs or bars as a sound engineer, or by maintaining equipment for PA system rental companies.|$|R
50|$|Formal {{socialization}} {{refers to}} those tactics in which newcomers {{are more or}} less segregated from others and <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> These processes can be witnessed with such socialization programs as police academies, internships, and apprenticeships. Informal socialization processes, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, involve little separation between newcomers and the existing employees, nor is there any effort made to distinguish the newcomer’s role specifically. Informal tactics provides a non-interventional environment for recruits to learn their new roles via trial and error. Examples of informal socialization include on-the-job training assignments, apprenticeship programs with no clearly defined role, and more generally, any situation in which a newcomer is placed into a work group with no recruit role.|$|R

The third component, unique at the time, offered the services of [...] "lay therapists" [...] who were <b>trained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> by Worcester, McComb and others. Treatment consisted of a relatively brief form of analysis, support and direction for making changes in the patient's life, and the use of suggestion to relieve symptoms.
