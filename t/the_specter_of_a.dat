[...] The army leadership was also urged by Gouverneur Morris to use its influence with state legislatures to secure their approval for needed changes. [...] On February 12, McDougall sent a letter (signed with the pseudonym Brutus) to General Knox suggesting that the army might have to mutiny by refusing to disband until it was paid. [...] He specifically told Knox to not make any direct steps, but that he should [...] "not lose a moment preparing for events." [...] Historian Richard Kohn is of the opinion that the purpose of these communications was not to foment a coup or military action against Congress or the states, but to use <b>the</b> <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recalcitrant army's refusal to disband as a political weapon against the antinationalists. [...] The nationalists were also aware of a significant cadre of lower-level officers who were unhappy with General Washington's leadership and had gravitated to the camp of Major General Horatio Gates, a longtime Washington rival.

First, it must be determined whether the increase in defense spending is due to an existing arms race, the historically high revenues <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commodity boom, or if it is simply a military modernization effort. What are the possible reactions of neighboring countries? Further, can game theory be used to provide predictions for regional conflict in South America? Despite <b>the</b> <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arms race in the region, this thesis explains that the increased defense spending in both Chile and Venezuela relates more to the 2003 - 2008 commodity boom than a competitive arms build-up in the region.
