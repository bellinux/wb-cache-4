Some surprising results emerge. For example, the merit of <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> process depends on the agent's aversion to unfairness, and appeals may be optimally denied even if <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> process is more accurate than the initial evaluation and is costless. An increase in the accuracy of the initial evaluation may reduce the principal's welfare. Furthermore, the principal's welfare can increase as the cost of <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> process increases.

However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain finally called for a replacement ball.
