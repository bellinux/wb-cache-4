5|$|After Abraham Lincoln's {{election}} as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he {{regarded as a}} holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, {{one of the last}} federal outposts in the South, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E

5|$|Daggoth was the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the entire}} zerg swarm war-machine. As the highest ranking cerebrate, Daggoth was a tactical genius {{in command of the}} Tiamat Brood, the largest and most powerful brood in the Zerg Swarm. Voiced by Micky Neilson, Daggoth is the most strong-willed and ferocious of the cerebrates. It trains the player character in the Zerg campaign of StarCraft and dispenses forces to protect Kerrigan following her transformation. Daggoth was charged with protecting the Overmind itself. In the wake of the Overmind's death, Daggoth immediately takes command of the fractured Zerg broods, annihilated several renegade zerg broods, and ordered several cerebrates to merge <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Overmind.|$|E

In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants. During her visits, a red carpet and garlands were put out {{and the air was}} sprayed with deodorant. Under Imelda's patronage, the hotel reaped international recognition and awards.

The new team was called Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd, and the club's first match at Anfield was a friendly played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against Rotherham Town.

5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> coalition against France. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium.|$|E

[...] The reports indicated that Fielding had tried to recruit Tim Costello and others around the beginning of 2008 with <b>a</b> view <b>to</b> <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> party, but had failed to convince them.

5|$|McGivney {{traveled}} to Boston {{to examine the}} Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn, New York {{to learn about the}} recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day.
