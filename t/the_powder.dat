5|$|The {{last of the}} Texians to die {{were the}} 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel.

Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from <b>the</b> <b>powder.</b> Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.|$|E

5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot.

5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns.

After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion.

Soon afterwards, seawater inundated <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> room of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action.

50|$|Water {{mixed into}} <b>the</b> <b>powders</b> can form bonds between powder {{particles}} that {{are strong enough}} to lock them together. However, once the water dries, <b>the</b> <b>powders</b> may fall apart. Therefore, water may not be strong enough to create and hold a bond. In such instances, a liquid solution that includes a binder (pharmaceutical glue) is required. Povidone, which is a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), {{is one of the most}} commonly used pharmaceutical binders. PVP is dissolved in water or solvent and added to the process. When PVP and a solvent/water are mixed with powders, PVP forms a bond with <b>the</b> <b>powders</b> during <b>the</b> process, and the solvent/water evaporates (dries). Once the solvent/water has been dried and <b>the</b> <b>powders</b> have formed a more densely held mass, then the granulation is milled. This process results in the formation of granules.|$|R
