5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{growing body}} of work sug-gests that the {{activity}} of ion channels and pumps is an important regulatory factor in embryonic development. We are beginning to identify func-tional roles for proteins suggested by a survey of expression of ion channel and pump genes in Xenopus and chick embryos (Rutenberg et al. [2002] Dev Dyn 225, this issue). Here, we report that the ATP-sensitive K channel protein is present in <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> gland of Xenopus em-bryos; moreover, we show that its activity is nec-essary for hatching in Xenopus. Pharmacologic inhibition of KATP channels not only specifically prevents <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> process but also greatly re-duces the endogenous expression of Connexin- 30 in <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> gland. Based on recentworkwhich showed that gap-junctional communication medi-ated by Cx 30 in <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> gland was required for secretion of <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> enzyme, we propose that KATP channel activity is upstream of Cx 30 ex-pression and represents a necessary endogenous step in <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> of <b>the</b> Xenopus embryo...|$|R
25|$|On flight day 11 {{the joint}} ISS/shuttle crews {{completed}} transfers and closed <b>the</b> <b>hatches</b> with <b>the</b> MPLM. Once <b>the</b> <b>hatches</b> were closed, <b>the</b> MPLM was deactivated, demated and berthed {{back in the}} payload bay of the space shuttle. During this process José Hernández and Nicole Stott {{took part in a}} PAO event. The end of the crews work days saw the two crews say goodbye in a farewell ceremony and close <b>the</b> <b>hatches</b> between <b>the</b> shuttle and ISS. Once <b>the</b> <b>hatches</b> were closed, <b>the</b> Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 was depressurized, in advance of undocking. The shuttle crew setup and checked out the rendezvous tools before going to bed.|$|R
5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked {{in place on}} <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> covers.|$|E
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> open outward and use explosive bolts to blow <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> {{in case of}} emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, rather than for emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of <b>the</b> <b>hatch.</b> Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> could be opened.|$|E
40|$|The study {{considers}} {{the effect of}} white and monochromatic light on <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> of <b>the</b> hybrid ROSS 208 chickens. The chicken embryos were most sensitive to white light, reaching <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> time of 499. 80 ± 2. 65 hours, thehatchability of 95. 08 ± 2. 43 %, and an average weight of <b>the</b> <b>hatched</b> chickens 47. 17 ± 3. 08 g. Of the monochromaticlights, the chicken embryos were most sensitive to yellow light with <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> time of 501. 16 ± 1. 84 hours, thehatchability of 94. 97  1. 92 % and average weight of hatched chicken 45. 88  2. 32 g.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the sire hunts, there was <b>the</b> <b>Hatching</b> Hunt, an event held in the Desert during <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> season: triennial in mid-summer. An ensemble of Lords sets out from Stronghold to slay the still young and fairly weak dragons. These hunts were necessary to keep the dragon population down, but the hunters also profited by collecting the coveted dragon hides. During <b>the</b> <b>Hatching</b> Hunt, <b>the</b> hunters waited outside the sealed dragon caves, then slew the hatchlings as they emerged into sunlight for the first time.|$|R
40|$|To further {{investigate}} {{the development and}} the ultrastructure of <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> gland (HG) of Odontobutis potamophila during its embryonic and post-embryonic development, <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> gland was examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at heart beating stage, lens formation stage, blood circulation stage, eye pigmentation stage, pre-hatching stage and larval fish just after hatching stage of its embryonic and post-embryonic development. <b>The</b> <b>hatching</b> gland was unicellular and was detected first at the stage of lens formation. <b>The</b> <b>hatching</b> gland cells (HGCs) were located in the ventral of the head, the joint region between the head and yolk sac, and the ventral of the yolk sac. At the blood circulation stage, the number and the volume of HGCs increased significantly, and HGCs spread more widely {{with the development of}} the embryo; When the embryo reached the eye pigmentation stage，zymogen granules at different stages were detected,and every one of the zymogen granule was wrapped by membrane, so that the limit between others can be distinguished significantly; When the embryo reached the pre-hatching stage, <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> enzyme granules were secreted into the perivitelline space from the top of HGCs. The secreted granules were spherical and 0. 25 – 1. 00 μm in diameter. Some of the secreted granules were monomer and the others got together. <b>The</b> <b>hatching</b> enzyme was dissolved in the perivitelline fluid,where it gained access to the egg envelope and digested the inner layer of egg envelope；At the larval fish just after <b>hatching</b> stage, <b>the</b> secretion of HGCs have finished and HGCs gradually disappeared from epidermis. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> enzymes of Odontobutis potamophila gradually maturated during its embryonic and post-embryonic development, and <b>the</b> mature <b>hatching</b> enzymes were excreted from the open of the HGCs to the perivitelline space for <b>the</b> embryo <b>hatching...</b>|$|R
5|$|Three spacewalks were {{conducted}} by the crew of STS-97, {{all of which were}} completed prior to opening <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> between shuttle and station. On 8 December, <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first time. It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures. The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{official}} NASA flight {{plan called for}} a crew rest period before extra-vehicular activity, Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> was opened and Armstrong {{made his way down}} the ladder first.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in <b>the</b> <b>hatch,</b> the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to test whether it is {{possible}} to produce early hatching cysts of Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay (SFB) by truncation selection. The starting material was an SFB cyst sample, harvested in nature. After selection of early hatching nauplii had taken place, these selected individuals were cultured to maturity, and <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> rate of their offspring (F 1) was compared with that of the parental generation and with the non-selected control F 1. The possible differences in hatching rate were used to estimate heritability. Two different selection experiments were run, accompanied with a number of additional tests studying the influence of <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> set-up, <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> temperature and diapause termination using hydrogen peroxide, on <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> rate. Also <b>the</b> influence of different culture salinities on hatching rate and on possible success of selection was studied. The results revealed an influence of all those abiotic factors on <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> rate, but also a marked interference of <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> percentage with <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> rate. Choosing <b>the</b> individuals based on their own phenotypic values (hatching within a certain time span of hatching incubation) and using those to produce the next generation, revealed a positive response. The selection in different salinities showed a different response. Depending on the strength of the selection pressure, the samples were advanced in time, starting with the highest selection pressure, and ending with the control and the parental sample. In spite of the strong interference of environmental factors, our results suggest that selection of early hatching cysts is possible...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>hatching</b> of a {{blastocyst}} {{where the}} blastocyst portions {{on the inside}} and the outside of the zona pellucida feature a figure-of-eight shape is termed " 8 "-shaped hatching; this type of hatching has been reported to affect the proper presentation of the inner cell mass (ICM) in both human and mouse embryos. Here, our aim was to investigate the factors that affect ICM presentation during " 8 "-shaped hatching. We performed IVF by using B 6 D 2 F 1 female mice and ICR male mice, and used the 104 captured blastocysts. Embryos were maintained in KSOM at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2, 5 % O 2, and 90 % N 2 environment, and their growth behavior was monitored individually and continuously using time-lapse cinematography. At 120 h after insemination, embryos were immunostained and examined under a confocal microscope. We used <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> form to identify " 8 "-shaped hatching, and we classified the " 8 "-shaped-hatching blastocysts into two groups, one in which <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> site was near the ICM center, and the other in which <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> site was far from the ICM center. We measured each group for ICM size and the number of Oct 3 / 4 -positive cells. Of <b>the</b> 95 <b>hatching</b> or hatched embryos, 74 were " 8 "-shaped-hatching blastocysts, and in these embryos, the ICM was significantly wider when <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> site was near the ICM than when <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> site was far from the ICM (P = 0. 0091). Moreover, in the " 8 "-shaped-hatching blastocysts in which the ICM was included in the blastocyst portion outside the zona pellucida-the portion defined as the "outside blastocyst"-after the collapse of this outside blastocyst, the ICM adhered to the trophectoderm of the outside blastocyst, opposite <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> site. Our results indicate that in " 8 "-shaped-hatching blastocysts, <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> site and <b>the</b> collapse of outside blastocyst affect ICM formation. Thus, the assessment of " 8 "-shaped hatching behaviors could yield indices for accurately evaluating embryo quality...|$|R

5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below <b>the</b> <b>hatch.</b> It was determined that he had tried to open <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened <b>the</b> <b>hatch.</b> Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>hatching</b> enzyme is a developmentally {{regulated}} protease secreted at the blastula stage by the {{sea urchin}} embryo to digest its protective envelope. A nearly full-length cDNA clone (HE 6) encoding the entire sequence of <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> enzyme was isolated from a prehatching blastula lambda gt 11 cDNA library. The 1761 bp open reading frame codes for a preprohatching enzyme with an 18 amino acid signal sequence, a 148 amino acid activation peptide and a 421 amino acid mature enzyme which has homologies with the mammalian collagenases. Transcripts of <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> enzyme gene are not detected in the unfertilized egg, they accumulate during the cleavage stages and disappear at hatching. This transient expression results from a transcriptional control. Thus <b>the</b> <b>hatching</b> enzyme mRNA is not a maternal gene product but a transcript synthesized {{at a very early}} stage from the zygotic genome...|$|R
