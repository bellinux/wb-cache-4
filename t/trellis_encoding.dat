More specifically, the rate {{found by the}} bit allocation algorithm for each transform coefficient is used as the conditional entropy constraint {{in the design of}} a CEC-TCQ for that coefficient. As described in Section 2.3, the CEC-TCQ designs are based on scalar-side information obtained by a linear transform of the vector side-information at the decoder, see Theorem 3. All CEC-TCQ designs are based on the 8 -state trellis used in JPEG 2000 [[26], Figure 3.16]. For <b>trellis</b> <b>encoding</b> and decoding, a sequence length of 256 source samples has been used. For design and testing quantizers, sample sequences of length 5 × 105 have been used. Since, the main focus this paper is the design of transforms and the quantizers, we assume ideal SW coding of the binary output of each CEC-TCQ, so that our results do not depend on any particular SW coding method. In a practical implementation (e.g., [20]), near optimal performance can be obtained by employing a sufficiently long SW code (note that sequence length for SW-coding can be chosen arbitrary larger than the sequence length used for TCQ encoding). This type of coding is well suited for applications such as distributed image compression, where the coding is inherently block-based.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1950 s, hidden Markov models (HMMS) {{have seen}} {{widespread}} use in electrical en-gineering. Foremost has been {{their use in}} speech processing, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, queuing theory, and communications theory. However, recent years have wit-nessed a renaissance {{in the application of}} HMMs to the analysis and simulation of digital communication systems. Typical applications have included signal estimation, frequency tracking, equalization, burst error characterization, and transmit power control. Of special significance to this thesis, however, has been the use of HMMs to model fading channels typical of wireless communications. This variegated use of HMMs is fueled by their ability to model time-varying systems with memory, their ability to yield closed form solutions to otherwise intractable analytic problems, and their ability to help facilitate simple hardware and/or software based implementations of simulation test-beds. The aim of this thesis is to employ and exploit hidden Markov fading models within an iterative (turbo) decoding framework. Of particular importance is the problem of channel estimation, which is vital for realizing the large coding gains inherent in turbo coded schemes. This thesis shows that a Markov fading channel (MFC) can be conceptualized as a trellis, and that the transmission of a sequence over a MFC {{can be viewed as a}} <b>trellis</b> <b>encoding</b> process much like convolutional encoding. The thesis demonstrates that either maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) algorithms or maximum a posteriori (MAP) algo-rithms operating over the trellis defined by the MFC can be used for channel estimation.

In this paper, we explore possible trade-off between power consumption (estimated by the average number of iterations) and performance of turbo decoders when short frame turbo codes are used. Three encoding/decoding schemes are proposed to improve performance of turbo decoder in terms of frame/bit error rate, and to increase the data transmission efficiency whether ARQ protocols are performed or not. Specifically, turbo decoding metrics aided short CRC codes are applied to terminated <b>trellis</b> codes, tail-biting <b>encoded</b> <b>trellis</b> codes and CRC embedded trellis codes with a two-fold purpose: to stop the iterative decoding processes and to detect decoding errors at the last iteration.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an {{implementation of a}} mod-ulation technique which is effective in obscuring spectral phase encoded time-spreading (SPECTS) optical {{code division multiple access}} (O-CDMA) data streams from eavesdroppers tapping into single-user uplinks. This data modulation technique employs a finite-state Markov chain following a four-state <b>trellis</b> to <b>encode</b> user data in the electronic domain. The encoding redistributes the SPECTS O-CDMA user data bits across four different wave-forms to defeat the eavesdropper attacks on upstream links via power detectors or differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) receivers. The four-state encoder-decoder is implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with high-speed serial transceivers. A SPECTS O-CDMA testbed with four-state en-coded data modulation at up to 2. 5 Gb/s/user is demonstrated and its single user link security is tested using a DPSK demodulator to emulate the eavesdropping detection. The security test verifies that this modulation technique effectively prevented interception by DPSK detection. The four-state coding can be extended to be time variable through switching among several trellis state definitions to achieve more rigorous security.

The more compact data structure for these encoders confers some advantages on MNBTCs over other types of turbo codes, such as better asymptotic behavior, better convergence, and reduced latency. This paper presents in detail the structure and operation of an MNBTC: MNB <b>encoding,</b> <b>trellis</b> termination, Max-Log-MAP decoding adapted to the MNB case.

40|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of active distances, {{originally}} introduced for binary convolutional codes, was extended {{to the case of}} nonlinear trellis coded modulation. These distance measures allow an improved evaluation of the error correcting capability for trellis codes.

Moreover, these distance measures are of particular interest for the design of concatenated coding schemes, with respect to the choice of the inner trellis code as well as the interleaver. In this paper we present a matrix based method to compute the active distances for trellis codes in Euclidean space, encoded by an -state finite state machine. The computation is based on a simplified version of the distance generating matrix, which is well known from the calculation of the distance spectrum of trellis codes. In general the distance generating matrix is of size. We show that for <b>trellis</b> codes, <b>encoded</b> by an -state FSM, the distance generating matrix can always be reduced to fiffflffi !"ff.

40|$|The thesis investigates Joint Source and Channel Coding (JSCC) using {{combined}} Trellis Coded Quantization (TCQ) {{and coded}} modulation. First we investigate a JSCC scheme using combined TCQ/Trellis Coded CPM (TCQ/TCCPM). Based on the BCJR algorithm for trellis coded CPM, we derive an optimal soft decoding algorithm for the considered systems. Analytical bounds on the channel distortion for jointly designed TCQ/TCCPM systems with maximum likelihood sequence detection are derived. These bounds {{are based on}} the transfer function technique, which has been modified and generalized to analog signals in discrete time for our purpose. This work provides an analysis tool to estimate the performance for a given combined TCQ/TCCPM system. The analysis method is very general, and may be applied to any trellis based JSCC scheme. Next, we develop an iterative decoding approach to JSCC using serially concatenated TCQ/CPM. This iterative procedure exploits the structure of the TCQ encoder and the continuous phase modulator.

The purpose of this work is to provide analytical tools to predict and evaluate the effectiveness of that redundancy. Integer binary Arithmetic Coding (AC) is modeled by a reduced-state automaton in order to obtain a bit-clock <b>trellis</b> describing the <b>encoding</b> process. Considering AC as a trellis code, distance spectra are then derived. In particular, an algorithm to compute the free distance of an arithmetic code is proposed. The obtained code properties allow to compute upper bounds on both bit error and symbol error probabilities and thus provide an objective criterion to analyze the behavior of JSCAC schemes when used on noisy channels. This criterion is then exploited to design efficient error-correcting arithmetic codes. Simulation results highlight the validity of the theoretical error bounds and show that for equivalent rate and complexity, a simple optimization yields JSCACs that outperform classical tandem schemes at low to medium SNR...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{convolutional}} codes have a natural, regular trellis structure that facilitates the implementation of Viterbi's algorithm. It has gradually become apparent that linear block codes also have a natural, though not in general a regular, 'minimal' trellis structure, which allows them to be decoded with a Viterbi-like algorithm. In both cases, the complexity of the Viterbi decoding algorithm can be accurately estimated by the number of <b>trellis</b> edges per <b>encoded</b> bit. It would, therefore, appear {{that we are in a}} good position to make a fair comparison of the Viterbi decoding complexity of block and convolutional codes. Unfortunately, however, this comparison is somewhat muddled by the fact that some convolutional codes, the punctured convolutional codes, are known to have trellis representations that are significantly less complex than the conventional trellis. In other words, the conventional trellis representation for a convolutional code may not be the minimal trellis representation. Thus, ironically, at present we seem to know more about the minimal trellis representation for block than for convolutional codes. In this article, we provide a remedy, by developing a theory of minimal trellises for convolutional codes. (A similar theory has recently been given by Sidorenko and Zyablov). This allows us to make a direct performance-complexity comparison for block and convolutional codes. A by-product of our work is an algorithm for choosing, from among all generator matrices for a given convolutional code, what we call a trellis-minimal generator matrix, from which the minimal trellis for the code can be directly constructed. Another by-product is that, in the new theory, punctured convolutional codes no longer appear as a special class, but simply as high-rate convolutional codes whose trellis complexity is unexpectedly small...|$|R
