Comm. on Law Reform and Racial Activities that the conviction violated Scull's 14th Amendment rights to due process because the committee's inquiry was so vague and so confusing that Scull could not <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> he was being asked.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{reaction}} has {{deemed the}} Heller ruling {{to be of}} great significance, though it remains too soon to <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> the long-term effects may be.

25|$|While it is {{relatively}} easy to <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> a mitigation project or programme is (i.e. its contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and/or whether it increases the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb them), the blurred line between a general development project and an adaptation project has been a contentious issue in the international climate finance debate, including at Green Climate Fund Board meetings, {{according to a report by}} the Climate and Development Knowledge Network.|$|E

25|$|Foley {{is another}} method of adding sound effects. Foley {{is more of}} a {{technique}} for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect, but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen, such as footsteps. With this technique the action onscreen is essentially recreated to try to match it as closely as possible. If done correctly it is very hard for audiences to <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> sounds were added and what sounds were originally recorded (location sound).|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} 17 years, Gandalf {{travelled}} extensively, searching for answers on the Ring. He found some answers in Isildur's scroll, {{in the archives}} of Minas Tirith. But he also wanted to interview Gollum, who had borne the Ring for many years. Gandalf searched long and widely for Gollum, and often had the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeded, and Gandalf questioned Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proved unwilling to speak. Gandalf learned finally that Sauron had forced Gollum under torture in Barad-dûr to <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> he knew of the Ring. This reinforced Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring was the One Ring.|$|E
25|$|The Yat dialect is {{the most}} {{pronounced}} version of the New Orleans Accent. Natives often speak {{with varying degrees of}} the Brooklyn-esque accent, ranging from a slight intonation to what is considered full Yat. As with all dialects, there is variance by local speakers due to geographic and social factors. This results in many different levels of Yat throughout the area, marking distinct differences between higher-income people and lower-income people. Yat tends to differ in strength and intonation from neighborhood to neighborhood. The type, strength, and lexicon of the accent vary from section to section of the New Orleans Metropolitan Area. Longtime residents can often <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> area the other residents are from by their accent.|$|E

When Zhong Hui was four years old, his father sent him to meet Jiang Ji, who noted that the boy was extraordinary. By the time Zhong Hui reached adulthood, he was already famous for being hardworking, well read, and versed in different types of arts. During the Zhengshi era (240–249) of the reign of Cao Fang, he served as a Gentleman Cadet of the Imperial Library (秘書郎) and was later promoted to Attendant Gentleman of the Palace Writers and Masters of Writing (尚書中書侍郎). He was awarded the title of a Secondary Marquis (爵關內) when Cao Mao ascended the throne in 254.|$|E
25|$|In American Dog Owners Ass'n v. City of Yakima, 777 P.2d 1046 (Wash.1989, en banc), the Washington Supreme Court {{reviewed}} a {{pit bull}} ban in Yakima, Washington. The dog owners asked a state court to prevent Yakima from enforcing its ban on pit bull dogs. The trial court issued a temporary injunction against the city and accepted motions for summary judgment from both the dog owners and the city. The court decided {{in favor of the}} city and lifted the injunction, whereupon the dog owners appealed to the Washington Supreme Court {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could not <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> was prohibited, and that the trial court had improperly decided the summary judgment in favor of the city.|$|E
25|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004. The grand jury had nineteen jurors; the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors. Prosecution witnesses testified without defense cross-examination. The judge ruled that witnesses {{before the grand jury}} could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> they saw in the grand jury room or what questions they were asked and their answers. Many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting, sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities. In February 2005 The Smoking Gun published the Grand Jury transcripts (1903 pages).|$|E

25|$|John Gough senior died by 'taking an {{overdose}} of strichnine'. The coroner's report which might explain the reason has not survived. The day after his death, the local Burrangong Courier had no explanation for the event: `A man {{of the name of}} John George Gough, an old colonist, who occupied a butcher's shop adjoining Myers' cordial manufactory in Main Street, committed suicide yesterday morning by swallowing strychnine. He was in the Diggers' Theatre, apparently in excellent spirits, on the previous night, and no one now can <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> led to the sad act. Gough was a widower, and leaves a young son who is now unprotected, and for whom we now appeal to the sympathies of the generous in order that he may be enabled to earn an honest living.|$|E
25|$|The salmon {{fisheries}} of the Columbia River are now but {{a fraction}} of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures {{have never been able to}} agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz's mother Hedwig died in November 1922, {{and as he}} {{did with}} his father he buried his grief in his work. He spent time with Paul Strand and his new wife Rebecca (Beck), {{reviewed}} the work of another newcomer named Edward Weston and began organizing a new show of O'Keeffe's work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz spent much of the spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O'Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz was alone with Beck Strand at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O'Keeffe returned in the fall. O'Keeffe could <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz's new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she let things pass. Six years later she would have her own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.|$|E
