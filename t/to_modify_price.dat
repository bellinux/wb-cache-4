30|$|The main {{contributions}} of the paper may be summarized as follows. In contrary to published works where mostly analytical formulations of the spectrum trading problem are discussed (refer to Section 2 for the literature overview), the research {{presented in this paper}} provides specific implementation of the ABMS modeling to the problem of the spectrum pricing. The model consists of the set of rules that regulate interactions, which yields eventually to the spontaneous formation of the partially oligopolistic market structure. This is perceived here as an emergent phenomenon identifiable via the price effects. The most significant is the interaction between PUs mediated by the demand of the SUs. Its variability causes the changes in profit, which stimulate Bak-Sneppen mechanism <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> the spectrum <b>prices</b> and levels of cooperation.|$|R

An efficient solution technique to solve the resulting large-scale discontinuous nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem is reported.

In order to survive in such abominable environment, people have put many efforts on construction methodology, materials, budget planning, and strategy alliance. However, to properly enhance the construction management is the key issue to raise company’s competition. Therefore, an effective administrating tool is a must in construction life cycle such as estimating, bidding, procurement, scheduling, site managing, and valuation. This research has utilized Object Oriented concept, E/R techniques and Delphi environment to develop the Construction Integrated Manage System (CIMS). Through the help of this tool, user can effectively generate Bidding List, Purchasing Materials, Labor and Material Analyze Items and Specifications. Basic Database System can help us <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> resource <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> adjust budget, effectively control project cost and financial planning. Budget Control System will inform engineers when overspend occurs. Purchasing System can assist us to select the best subcontractors with most reasoning price. Valuation system can extract money request data from site records; therefore, prevent the over-calculating and short-calculating to achieve a better financial administration. With the help of CIMS, we can effectively control all details such as bidding, purchasing, contracting and evaluating, for each construction stage. This integrated system can practically control all information, maximize construction management efforts, raise company’s strength, increase competition, and create profit for construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{phenomenon}} of infrequent price changes has troubled economists for decades. Intuitively one feels {{that for most}} price-setters there exists a range of inaction, i. e. a substantial measure of {{the states of the}} world, within which they do not wish <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> prevailing <b>prices.</b> However, basic economics tells us that when marginal costs change it is rational to change prices, too. Economists wishing to maintain rationality of price-setters resorted to fixed price adjustment costs as an explanation for price rigidity. In this paper we propose an alternative explanation, without recourse to any sort of physical adjustment cost, by putting strategic interaction into the center-stage of our analysis. Pricemaking is treated as a repeated oligopoly game. The traditional analysis of these games cannot pinpoint any equilibrium as a reasonable ”solution” of the strategic situation. Thus there is genuine strategic uncertainty, a situation where decision-makers are uncertain of the strategies of other decision-makers. Hesitation may lead to inaction. To model this situation we follow the style of agent-based models, by modelling firms that change their pricing strategies following an evolutionary algorithm. Our results are promising. In addition to reproducing the known negative relationship between price rigidity and the level of general inflation, our model exhibits several features observed in real data. Moreover, most prices fall into the theoretical ”range ” without explicitly building this property into strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|Credibility {{theory is}} a set of {{quantitative}} tools which allows insurers to perform prospective experience rating on a risk or group of risks in a heterogeneous portfolio. Credibility theory promotes a mechanism for the implementation of risk management strategies by differentiating between good and poor risks. It is used in the setting of rates for classification systems. Furthermore, application of credibility theory would also help to improve the ability of insurance companies <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> their <b>price</b> structure with the changing economic environment. Dannenburg [7] introduced a crossed classification credibility (CCC) model applicable to contracts that could be affected by many risk factors, that can not be modeled as nested or hierarchical relationships. In practice, the main problem in crossed classification credibility is the estimation of structure parameters. In a two-way CCC model, these parameters are the collective mean m, the time variance s 2, and the variance components b (1), b (2), and b (12). Dannenburg has already proposed estimators of these structure parameters. However, they have no known optimality property except unbiasedness. Goulet [24] proposed minimum variance unbiased (optimal) estimators for the mean and variance components. This thesis focuses on the implementation of the variance components estimators calculation. Analysis of algorithms and numerical evaluation procedures are studied to achieve computing efficiency. Through a simulation study, optimality of these estimators is then assessed in comparison to estimators proposed by Dannenburg [7...|$|R

5000|$|This {{distribution}} channel {{involves more than}} one intermediary before the product gets {{into the hands of}} the consumer. This middleman, known as the agent, assists with the negotiation between the manufacturer and the seller. Agents come into play when the producers need to get their product into the market as quickly as possible. This happens mostly when the item is perishable and has to get to the market fresh before it starts to rot. At times, the agent will directly go to the retailer with the goods, or take an alternate route through the wholesaler who will go to a retailer and then finally to the consumer. A mutual cooperation normally occurs when parties, in particular, the last channel of marketing chain of distribution meet. Due to the fact that producers, agents, retailers/wholesalers and consumers of this channel aid each other and benefit from each other. Their cooperation generates a greater output in terms of further profitability, by discernment and exploring newer markets of sales and building a better business relationship. The participants of {{distribution channel}}s must have knowledge and experience not only for the effective maintenance of target segments but also to maintain the competitive advantage of the manufacturer. For example, an Agent who is able to vary prices for certain products can negotiate and or lower prices. This will assist him in sustain the comparative advantage, stay on top of its competitors and stay demanded on the market. A Broker works mainly to bring the seller and the buyer and to assist in the negotiation process. An intermediary like Broker is usually dependent on the commission of a sold product or production in terms of goods. In addition, therefore, a Broker is involved in one-off transactions and can not be an effective channel of distribution. However, he can maintain a competitive advantage over other firms in the form of a particular brand if he has obtained the right to exclusive representation of the manufacturer and can profit from it more. He acts on behalf of the seller (Producer/Manufacture) and has no rights <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>prices</b> for products. In addition, having formed a channel of distribution it is important to remember that the exploitation and utilization of intermediaries in a business (not only wholesalers, retailers but also transport logistics) will lengthen the chain of distribution. A business will then need to consider which channel is more cost effective and productive in terms of time delivery, efficiency, pricing policy and where it stands among competitors; for example, overall feedback, higher rating, higher demand from customers etc. The best use and help of intermediaries can be applied to start-up businesses and perhaps an established business ...|$|R

30|$|An {{advantage}} of our data is that, {{in the first}} wave of the survey, firms were directly asked about certain features of their institutional setups and economic environments that are rarely available in administrative and household datasets. As for the firm-level institutional arrangements governing wage formation, the survey provides evidence on, among other things, the adoption and coverage of collective agreements, the extent of firm-level adjustment of wages to inflation, whether the firm follows time-dependent or state-dependent rules <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> wages and <b>prices,</b> and how frequent those adjustments are. Concerning the economic environment, the aspects of greater interest for our analysis are those that directly affect wage and labour adjustment strategies, that is, the degree of competitive pressure faced by the firm, its exposure to foreign markets, and different aspects of its price-setting behaviour. Another important set of relevant data from the survey concerns the firm’s workforce composition (fraction of permanent and temporary workers, of high-skilled and low-skilled workers, of white-collar and blue-collar workers); the degree of labour turnover; and the share of labour costs in total costs.|$|R
30|$|Relays in {{cellular}} {{systems are}} sensitive to interference. A good relay design will transmit {{in a way that}} avoids excess out-of-cell interference. This article proposes a two-step algorithm for relay design for the relay interference channel, which models a relay-based cellular system. The transmitters and relays are equipped with multiple antennas while the receivers are equipped with a single antenna. In the first step, we propose to apply existing single-hop strategies to design the transmission parameters of the transmitters. In the second step, we propose <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> the interference <b>pricing</b> approach to design the relays. Interference pricing is used to provide the relays with information on how interference impacts the end-to-end achievable rates. A new method is proposed to compute interference prices via an approximation of the end-to-end achievable rate to integrate information about the relationship of the parameters in the two hops to alleviate mismatch between the rates on two hops experienced by the direct application of prior algorithms, which are designed specifically for the single-hop interference channel. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other designs, including the naive approach of applying the single-hop interference pricing strategies on two hops.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{proved the}} existence of an unbounded market price of risk (MPR) or maximum generalized Sharpe ratio (GSR) if one combines the most important Brownian-motion-linked arbitrage free pricing models with a coherent and expectation bounded risk measure. Furthermore, explicit sequences of portfolios with a theoretical (risk, return) diverging to (&# 56256;&# 56320; 1;+ 1) were constructed and their performance tested. The empirical evidence revealed that the divergence to (&# 56256;&# 56320; 1;+ 1) is only theoretical (not real), but the MPR is much larger than the GSR of the most important international stock indices. The natural question is how <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> the available <b>pricing</b> models so as to prevent the caveat above. The theoretical MPR cannot equal inf nity but must be large enough (consistent with the empirical findings) and this will be the focus of this paper. It will be shown that every arbitrage free pricing model can be improved in such a manner that the new stochastic discount factor (SDF) satisfie the two requirements above, and the newMPR becomes bounded but large enough. This is important for several reasons; Firstly, if the existent models predict unrealistic price evolutions then these mistakes may imply important capital losses to practitioners and theoretical errors to researchers. Secondly, the lack of an unbounded MPR is much more coherent and consistent with equilibrium. Finally, the major discrepancies between the initial pricing model and the modifie one will affect the tails of their SDF, which seems to justify several empirical caveats of previous literature. For instance, it has been pointed out that {{it is not easy to}} explain the real quotes of many deeply OTM options with the existing pricing models...|$|R

40|$|Objective : To {{compare and}} {{evaluate}} the price and quality of "branded" and branded-generic equivalents of some commonly used medicines manufactured by the same pharmaceutical company in India. Materials and Methods : Five commonly used medicines: alprazolam, cetirizine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and lansoprazole manufactured in branded and branded-generic versions by the same company were selected. Price-to-patient and price-to-retailers were found for five "pair" of medicines. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis were performed following the methods prescribed in the Indian Pharmacopoeia 2007 on five "pair" of medicines. The tests performed were identification test, chemical composition estimation test, uniformity of contents test, uniformity of weight, and dissolution studies. Main Outcome Measures : Price-to-patient, retailer mark-up and qualitative analysis of branded and branded-generic medicines. Results : Retailer margin for five branded medicines were {{in the range of}} 25 - 30 &#x 0025; but for their branded-generics version manufactured by the same company it was in the range of 201 - 1016 &#x 0025;. Price-to-patient for the branded version of cetirizine, fluoxetine, ciprofloxacin, lansoprazole, and alprozolam was higher by 41 &#x 0025;, 33 &#x 0025;, 0 &#x 0025;, 14 &#x 0025;, and 31 &#x 0025; than branded-generic.
