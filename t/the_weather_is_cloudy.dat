Cumin is especially sensitive to Alternaria blight and Fusarium wilt. Early-sown crops exhibit stronger disease effects than late sown crops.

50|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Pacific Northwest, {{they found that}} <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> <b>cloudy</b> and rainy {{over most of the}} area.

When <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> also prevented their landing there, they headed southwest towards Pasco in the Tri-Cities area of the state. When that failed, they finally headed towards Wenatchee to land at Fancher Field, far from town. There, they had to make a belly landing because they had disposed of Miss Veedols landing gear over the western Pacific. She was damaged, but repairable, and her propeller was wrecked, but Herndon and Pangborn came through the landing all right.|$|R

At 3:55 a.m. Wasp ran aground on a reef. The initial shock broke the hull of the ship, and she began to rapidly fill with water. The commander ordered the ship's boats lowered, but Wasp hit the reefs again, sinking so quickly that the boats could not be launched. Within fifteen minutes Wasp had sunk. Six crewmen managed to cling to one of the gunboat's spars; they washed ashore on Tory Island and were found by islanders. The other 52 crew aboard drowned.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of different fungicide combinations to control late blight and the STOP {{effect of these}} fungicide combinations for the control of foliar and tuber blight under high infection pressure was investigated. Last summer late blight development was arrested in July due to high temperatures and lasting drought. In August <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> <b>cloudy,</b> rather cold {{and a lot of}} rain. These <b>weather</b> conditions <b>were</b> very favourable for late blight. Due to the heat waves of June and July the foliage started to die allready in August and P. infestans developped very fast {{in the second part of}} August. Because of that no incidence of foliage blight was scored. No significant differences in yield were observed for the different treatments applied. The combination cyazofamid + heptamethyltrisiloxaan (Ranman) + propamocarb + chlorothalonil (Tattoo C) had the highest yield. The percent diseased tubers fluctuated between 14, 9 and 45, 1 % for the different treatments tested.

30|$|Testing {{commenced}} {{on top of}} {{the central}} platform at Huánuco Pampa on 4 July 2015, at 10  a.m. <b>The</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> <b>cloudier</b> than a typical “dry season” day in the northern Peruvian highlands, and dark clouds to the southwest signaled an approaching storm. Winds increased around 11  a.m., occasionally contributing to 50 – 70  dBA measured peak noise levels during gusts; typical background noise readings without gusts were around 35  dBA. The storm moved into the area around 2  pm, with rain and hail starting around 3 : 30  p.m., marking the practical end of fieldwork. Although we have used temperature and humidity meters in previous Andean archaeoacoustics work—and strongly recommend logging these environmental data, along with wind speed and direction—we did not have access to meteorological tools. We noted the directionality of windy gusts, their noise level peaks (via sound level meter), and based on our team’s extensive experience in Andean fieldwork, made estimates of temperature (12 – 16  ℃), and humidity (47 – 68 %). Temperature and humidity measures are useful in calculating the speed of sound during an acoustical survey, which can be used for alternate distance calibration with video-documented points, and data-driven acoustical modeling.|$|R
