30|$|Some of the {{implications}} of behavioral economics for policy are overlooked in traditional formal economic analysis but reflect what might best be called “common sense” and are similar to the critiques and prescriptions of many long-time policy practitioners and analysts. These include recommendations to minimize the fragmentation and complexity of job <b>training,</b> employment, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> programs. The behavioral approach also reinterprets traditional labor market policy proposals by taking into account loss aversion and potentially biased wage expectations, particularly relevant considerations in the case for and the design of wage-loss insurance policies. Behavioral findings from other domains generate new insights critical to the choice architecture and choice platforms for helping unemployed and disadvantaged workers navigate <b>training</b> <b>and</b> education options (Thaler and Sunstein [2008]).|$|R
40|$|Firms and {{apprentices}} have {{conflicting interests}} {{with respect to}} the content of training programmes. On the basis of a model for the investment decision in occupation-specific <b>and</b> generic <b>training,</b> I will show that, in the case of imperfect competition, firms are not only unwilling to pay for generic training, they also want this component to be as low as possible because it decreases their expected returns to occupation-specific training. Therefore the generic component of the training will be below the social optimum. This underinvestment problem cannot always be solved by having the generic component fixed at the social optimum by an external training body. Fixing the generic component may negatively affect the level of occupation-specific <b>training</b> <b>and</b> decrease <b>social</b> <b>welfare.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This {{empirical}} research examines the economic security during transition to adulthood {{of young people}} with or without disabilities in state care (orphans) in China. As children they live in foster or institutional care. The mixed method research found that the state {{does not have a}} clear policy about transition out of care, including the age or conditions when state support continues or ceases. Instead of supporting their economic independence, the current policies focus on rearranging adult care for these young people. Many young people fail to transit to independent adult living and remain dependent on state welfare institutions. The implications are that policy reform is needed about setting goals and conditions for the end of state support, planning for transitions and processes to support independent living. Improvements in alternative care options, vocational planning <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> general <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> provision will contribute to the viability of these reform...|$|R
30|$|More specifically, the {{historical}} institutionalism highlights that institutions {{can be considered}} as a product of temporal processes. These institutions encompass rules, policy structures or certain norms. In this respect, historical institutionalists deal rather with the origins than the functions of newly created institutions. Hereafter, the evolution of the German model was not synchronous and marked by rather unintended consequences. For example, in Germany the intensive confrontation between the so-called social partners, namely employers and employees, led to the introduction or changes of institutions such as the vocational <b>training</b> system <b>and</b> the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> institutions. In that sense, path dependency includes parts that are kept (continuity) and parts which are modified (change). This implies for the article that the origin or rather development of institutions has to be viewed in their political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> setting. This approach recognizes that institutions are socially constructed and reflect a cultural understanding of the world (Thelen 1999, p.  382 – 386).|$|R
