5|$|The total {{volume of}} added strong base should be small {{compared}} to the initial volume of titrand solution {{in order to keep}} the ionic strength nearly constant. This will ensure that pKa remains invariant during the <b>titration.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{calculated}} <b>titration</b> curve for {{oxalic acid}} is {{shown at the}} right. Oxalic acid has pKa values of 1.27 and 4.27. Therefore, the buffer regions will be centered at about pH 1.3 and pH 4.3. The buffer regions carry the information necessary to get the pKa values as the concentrations of acid and conjugate base change along a buffer region.|$|E

The automatic titrator described provides a permanent digital and analog record of all <b>titrations.</b> The modular units which combine to form the automatic titrator are described individually.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the concentration of reactants {{on the results of}} <b>titrations</b> of salicylic acid in acetone with potassium and tetramethylammonium hydroxides in propan- 2 -ol were investigated. The <b>titrations</b> were performed by catalytic thermometric titrimetry using acetone as the end-point indicator and by potentiometric titrimetry. These and other results are discussed in terms of the equilibrium and kinetic aspects involved in the <b>titrations</b> of polyfunctional acids capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds...|$|R
50|$|Thermometric <b>titrations</b> {{generally}} demand rapid {{reaction kinetics}} {{in order to}} obtain sharp reproducible endpoints. Where reaction kinetics are slow, and direct <b>titrations</b> between titrant and titrand are not possible, indirect or back-titrations often can be devised to solve the problem.|$|R
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. <b>Titration</b> of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards <b>titration</b> of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the <b>titration</b> pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

25|$|An {{uncommon}} {{oxidising agent}} is N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). In this <b>titration,</b> the NBS oxidizes the ascorbic acid {{in the presence}} of potassium iodide and starch. When the NBS is in excess (i.e., the reaction is complete), the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide, which then forms the blue-black complex with starch, indicating the end-point of the <b>titration.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{simulate}} XAD- 8 isolates of Orange County groundwater and Biscayne Aquifer groundwater using mixtures of single ligands. Mixtures of catechol, glycine, phthalic acid and salicylic acid were used to simulate potentiometric and complexometric <b>titrations.</b> Concentrations used for the mixtures were based on carboxylic acidity, dissolved organic carbon, and assumed values for phenolic acidity and nitrogen content. Potentiometric <b>titrations</b> were reproduced with mixtures of the ligands; however, complexometric <b>titrations</b> at pH 6. 2 and pH 7. 5 could not be duplicated. A stronger ligand was required to fit the pH 6. 2 <b>titrations,</b> and higher carboxylic contents were needed for pH 7. 5. At pH 6. 2 70 percent of the binding sites were attributed to phthalic acid-type groups and 20 percent to catechol-type groups. At pH 7. 5 greater than 98 percent was attributed to phthalic acid-type groups...|$|R

50|$|Thermometric <b>titrations</b> {{employing}} sodium salts of ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) {{have been}} demonstrated for the determination {{of a range of}} metal ions. Reaction enthalpies are modest, so <b>titrations</b> are normally carried out with titrant concentrations of 1 mol/L.
