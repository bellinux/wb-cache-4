40|$|The {{central theme}} {{of this paper is}} the {{measurement}} of income inequality by investigating its present time in Banyumas. It is important to know the impact of local development process on income inequality. Not only the impacts of local development, but also other factors determining the trend of income inquality (i. e. fuel price raises, price and income adjustment policies) give impact on present income inequality. Nowaydays, the local development policies and the other factors are predicted that they give impact on <b>the</b> <b>raise</b> <b>of</b> recent income inquality in Banyumas. Based on Gini coefficient measurement method, we obtain startling result. The result presented in this paper is based on a sample of 180 households including urban area, sub urban area and rural area. The Gini coefficient result is 0, 603. This result shows <b>the</b> sharp <b>raise</b> <b>of</b> income inequality from past time to recent in Banyumas.
