5|$|Beckett {{recorded}} his 100th career win on July 12, 2009, pitching a complete game shutout against the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park. On August 7, 2009, against the New York Yankees, he {{engaged in a}} pitching duel with former Marlins teammate A. J. Burnett <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a fifteen-inning, five-hour-and-thirty-three-minute game. He threw seven shutout innings, Burnett threw seven and two thirds. The Red Sox eventually lost {{the game in the}} bottom of the 15th, when Alex Rodriguez hit a walk-off two run home run. He was 17–6 on the season, with a 3.86 ERA in 32 starts. He lost his one start in the postseason, to the Angels in game two of the 2009 ALDS.|$|E
5|$|Hornung {{finished}} {{his work with}} the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife's health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 they took a holiday {{in the south of}} France to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with a chill <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the south of France, in a grave adjacent to that of George Gissing. Doyle, returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of Australia, received the news in Paris and travelled south in time for the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{influence}} on events, {{it was more}} than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars. He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a rout. The force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.|$|E

25|$|The George Washington Bridge is {{notorious for}} traffic jams during rush hour, {{as are the}} {{highways}} connected to it, including the Trans-Manhattan Expressway <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> the Cross Bronx Expressway to the east, the Harlem River Drive <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> the FDR Drive, the Henry Hudson Parkway <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> West Side Highway to the south, and the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) in the Bronx {{at the other side}} of the Harlem River at its interchange with I-95. The western approaches in New Jersey are also slow, specifically I-95, US 1-9, and 46 (merged before the bridge), Route 4, and the Palisades Parkway.|$|R

5|$|Monastic reform {{inspired}} {{change in}} the secular Church. The ideals that it was based upon {{were brought to the}} papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage {{in the creation of a}} papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} faced {{uncertainty}} relating to {{who would be}} the starting quarterback. While it was expected that Tate Forcier would retain his starting job, the build-up to the season led to a quarterback controversy <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a three way battle between Forcier, Denard Robinson, and highly touted recruit Devin Gardner. On defense, Michigan installed a new 3–3–5 formation that the coaches hoped would better suit the players currently on the team. Michigan lost several key players from the previous season, including DE Brandon Graham, the 2009 Big Ten defensive Most Valuable Player, RB's Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown, LB Stevie Brown, and CB Donovan Warren. Michigan suffered a severe blow to its defensive secondary during fall practice, as starting CB Troy Woolfolk suffered a dislocated ankle that ended his season before it began.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the Multnomah County Library began distributing {{books to}} neighborhoods outside {{downtown}} Portland. A reading room {{was established in}} the Woodstock neighborhood's fire station building in 1908; later that year it was recognized as a branch of Multnomah County Library. Deposit stations, containing packing crates <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> two-shelf bookcases holding up to 50 books each, were often set up within fire stations or private homes. Woodstock received its deposit station, a collection of children's books housed within a public school, in 1909, becoming one of fifteen outlying service areas. On May 16, 1911, the Woodstock deposit station was replaced by a sub-branch library, supplying more reading material for adults and children but without the reference works and other library services offered at regular branches. The collection was moved to a larger storefront facility, west of SE 44th on SE Woodstock Boulevard, on September 12, 1914. The library achieved full branch status in 1917, offering a collection and services comparable to other branches. In 1918, the Woodstock branch and several others were threatened with closure after employees received a $10 per month salary increase, but funding sources helped to defray the additional expense. Along with other county libraries, the branch closed between November 1 and November 16 in response to the 1918 flu pandemic.|$|E

He was seized with grief and his health failed precipitously. He died on March 11, 1898 at Rancho Sausal Redondo, Redondo Beach, California. His casket lay in state in Los Angeles City Hall, covered by the headquarters flag that flew over Stones River and Chickamauga. In 1908 his remains were interred in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

It also contributed to Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's decision to attack Midway Island in the Central Pacific—an attack <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a decisive strategic defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the Battle of Midway. Doolittle, who initially believed that the loss of all his aircraft would lead to his court-martial, received the Medal of Honor and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.|$|E

25|$|White {{was first}} picked for England in the {{difficult}} 1921 series against the Australians and was not then selected again for seven years. For the winter tour of Australia in 1928/29, he was vice-captain to Percy Chapman and the main bowler in a series <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a successful war of attrition. At Melbourne, he bowled 113 overs and five balls, and at Adelaide he surpassed that, bowling 124 overs and five balls and taking 13 wickets in the match for 256 runs, as England won by just 12 runs. In the final Test of the series, he stood in as captain for the injured Chapman, but lost the Test and so ended England's then-record-equalling run of seven consecutive Test victories.|$|E
25|$|Against ARVN opponents, PAVN {{had greater}} success. In the ARVN Lam Son {{operation}} into Laos, ARVN troops were inserted by helicopter, covered by US airmobile, road advance operations and massive aerial firepower. The operation met heavy resistance, including intense antiaircraft fire. ARVN air insertions {{took them to}} the outskirts of Tchepone, but numerous helicopters were shot down or damaged. PAVN flanking tactics and ambushes also mauled the ARVN infantry battalions. US/ARVN reports claimed some 13,000 PAVN deaths and destruction of tons of material, but the ARVN was forced to withdraw, a maneuver <b>that</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a humiliating rout, salvaged only by unrelenting American airpower. Some 105 US helicopters were lost and an additional 615 damaged. The communist base area at Tchepone was back in business within a week. The vital role of sanctuary areas which could be developed in depth into strong bases was again illustrated.|$|E
