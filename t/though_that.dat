5|$|Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury {{in about}} 604, and ruled {{until his death}} on 2February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even <b>though</b> <b>that</b> was {{prohibited}} by canon law. Augustine was afraid <b>though</b> <b>that</b> if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so {{he may have been}} considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Brienne confronts Davos Seaworth and Melisandre, and informs {{them that}} she killed Stannis after he {{admitted}} to using dark magic to assassinate Renly. She warns Davos and Melisandre that even <b>though</b> <b>that</b> was in the past, she does not forget or forgive.|$|E

5|$|Although Alcuin had scorn for Æthelhard for fleeing Canterbury, {{the papacy}} saw it differently. Pope Leo III praised Æthelhard for fleeing {{and refusing to}} submit to Eadberht, whom Leo {{compared}} to the later Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. There are indications, <b>though,</b> <b>that</b> the Kentish community considered electing another archbishop while Æthelhard was in exile.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it <b>though</b> <b>that</b> debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|Copies of the {{developed}} film or summaries prepared by Moyzisch were promptly passed on to senior German leaders. Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs to Hitler immediately upon receipt. Hitler entered a conference with some Cicero materials in December 1943 and declared that the invasion in the west would come in spring 1944. He concluded, <b>though,</b> <b>that</b> there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{some initial}} success, the {{expedition}} of Boleslaw to Kiev in 1018 failed to establish Svyatopolk Vladimirovich (Boleslaw's son-in-law), Prince of Turov, on the Kievan throne. The Polish ruler did at least gain the Red Ruthenia (Czerwien Grody) very briefly, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> was recovered for the Ruthenians by Grand Prince Yaroslav and Mstislav Vladimirovich, Prince of Chernigov, in 1031.|$|E

5|$|Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani {{intelligence}} sources {{stated that the}} U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk-in was an extremely valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> allegation was denied by Khalid's family. The White House denied Hersh's report.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway {{roller coaster}} opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 {{by the larger}} Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and {{replaced}} by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, {{and other forms of}} entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{several other}} bones, {{including}} a jawless skull, {{were found in}} a sealed closet in the Cathedral of Turku.

The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.|$|E

50|$|Many {{features}} in modern CPUs -- instruction prefetch {{and more complex}} pipelineing, out-of-order execution, etc. -- maintain the illusion that each instruction finishes before the next one begins, giving the same final results, even <b>though</b> <b>that's</b> not exactly what happens internally.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, {{thousands}} of people were inadvertently exposed to lead containing soil / ore from informal gold mining with the northern state of Zamfara. While estimates vary, it is <b>though</b> <b>that</b> upwards of 400 children died of acute lead poisoning making this perhaps the largest lead poisoning fatality epidemic ever encountered. As of 2016, efforts to manage the exposure are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree <b>though</b> <b>that</b> the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E

5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even <b>though</b> <b>that</b> light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{images of}} Szczerbiec from various {{points in time}} {{indicate}} that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on the hilt in variable configurations. The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated {{on each side of}} the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, <b>though,</b> <b>that</b> the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of the hilt displayed the symbols of all four of the Evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Some {{collectors}} try {{to acquire}} a basic collection of the more common stamps from 1922 onwards, <b>though</b> <b>that</b> can be difficult now due to the quantity issued. Many collectors concentrate on one type of stamp, such as definitives or commemoratives, or even one issue, such as Gerl definitives. The First Day covers, especially commemoratives with full sets affixed, are popular though the older issues are harder to find because less than a million of the high value stamps were printed {{in the early years}} (1929–1940s) for several issues, a far lower number than the 20-plus millions printed for most of the low values during the same period.|$|E
