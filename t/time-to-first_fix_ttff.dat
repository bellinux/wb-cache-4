40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide {{various types}} of {{positioning}} state solutions, such as single point positioning (SPP), precise point positioning (PPP), differential GPS (DGPS) and real time kinematic (RTK) solutions. These solutions are obtained involving different data types, receivers, samples, serving different classes of users. Previous studies on performance characteristics have mainly focused on SPP solutions for safety-of-life navigation applications. This paper defines various useful performance characteristics for carrier phase Ambiguity Resolution (AR) and Position Estimation (PE) solutions in the RTK context. These parameters, including base-rover distance, <b>time-to-first</b> <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF),</b> AR availability, AR reliability, RTK accuracy, availability and integrity, etc, effectively represent {{the performance of a}} commercial RTK system and can be used to evaluate different systems and algorithms, and processing strategies through extensive experimental results. Statistical results from extensive field experiments were obtained using a commercial RTK system, demonstrating convincing overall system performance in different perspectives. Experimental results from three baselines were also analysed using a version of research-oriented RTK software, showing that AR performance improvement of using Wide-lane (WL) and Narrow-lane (NL) signals with respect to the original L 1 and L 2 signals when the baselines exceed 20 kilometres.

25|$|While the {{ephemeris}} data is transmitted every 30 seconds, the information itself may {{be up to}} two hours old. Variability in solar radiation pressure has an indirect effect on GPS accuracy due to its effect on ephemeris errors. If a fast time to first <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> is needed, {{it is possible to}} upload a valid ephemeris to a receiver, and in addition to setting the time, a position fix can be obtained in under ten seconds. It is feasible to put such {{ephemeris data}} on the web so it can be loaded into mobile GPS devices. See also Assisted GPS.|$|R
40|$|Assisted GPS (A-GPS) {{is being}} {{increasingly}} recognised by the public, users expecting {{to have a}} better performance of the A-GPS enabled devices than the conventional GPS receivers. This paper reported the evaluation of several A-GPS enabled receivers using a GPS signal generator and a specifically developed software. Under ideal conditions, several different scenarios were created to test the devices. Time To First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> and positioning accuracy were the two aspects of most interest. The results show that these A-GPS enabled receivers can obtain reasonable position solutions in well under 30 seconds, especially the newer receivers which have TTFF typically less than 10 seconds, can be as low as 3 seconds. Better performance of the new receivers in the market is expected...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{reviews the}} future impact of Galileo on {{spacecraft}} navigation systems. It outlines the Galileo benefits for spacecraft navigation systems, including {{the number of}} available frequencies and services, up to 3 separated frequencies for one service; application of the Three Carrier Ambiguity Resolution (TCAR) technique for substantial improved spacecraft attitude determination algorithms; high data rates for improved signal acquisition- Time To First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> and reacquisition receiver behavior, and so on. It is the authorâ€™s belief that the real impact from Galileo for new spacecraft navigation systems {{is driven by the}} interoperability between Galileo and GPS and subsequently the dual use of both systems.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} possible receiver acquisition strategies {{tailored to}} the Alternative Binary Offset Carrier (AltBOC) modulation {{that will be used}} by the Galileo system to transmit on the E 5 band. In particular the work addresses critical aspects for the acquisition of AltBOC signals, not deeply analyzed in previous works, and an innovative acquisition engine called multiresolution acquisition is proposed. It can be used with coherent dualband AltBOC receiver architectures as an effective solution to the main problems in the transition between the acquisition and the tracking operations (risk of false lock, resolution of the search space and computational burden). Finally, some simulation results are presented and the advantages of the multiresolution acquisition with respect to conventional strategies are discussed in terms of Time To First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> and implementation complexit...|$|R
40|$|The Namuru V 3. 2 GPS {{receiver}} is an Australian developed FPGA-based GPS receiver {{designed specifically}} for the Biarri Project; a multi-lateral Colony 2 cubesat defence project that Australia is participating in via the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. In this paper, a brief introduction to the Biarri mission requirements is provided, as are the various design features of the receiver that has been developed to satisfy those requirements. In particular, we focus on describing the features relating to operation of the receiver in low-earth orbit, in-orbit reprogramming of the receiver, {{and the provision of}} precise timing signals. GPS simulator test results using the latest generation of Namuru V 3. 2 receiver are also presented. These results show in-orbit positional accuracies within 10 m, velocity accuracies within 1 m/s and timing accuracies within 50 ns, while the warm-start <b>time-to-first</b> <b>fix</b> typically (90 %) occurs within one minute...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{dramatic}} increase of Location Based Services and other location and navigation applications {{gives rise to}} a crucial need to improve positioning solutions. Currently, the American GPS is the only operational satellite based positioning system as the European Galileo system will be operational by 2010. Hence, this paper only deals with GPS receivers. The Time To First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> and the sensitivity are the key drivers for their performance evaluation. The TTFF is the time needed for a GPS receiver to provide a first position. The sensitivity is the ability of a GPS receiver to acquire weak signals. For commercial solutions, an efficient receiver is a receiver with a reduced TTFF and high sensitivity. But generally, enhancing the sensitivity results in an increased TTFF and vice versa. In this paper, a use case will be defined which proposes an optimized solution to be applied in each type of GPS terrestrial environments, namely rural, urban and indoor environments...|$|R
40|$|GNSS {{technologies}} are progressively {{becoming one of}} the key elements in most of innovative wireless applications. Most location-based services and systems are in fact employing standalone GPS, GPS+EGNOS (or WAAS), Assisted-GPS and Differential GPS as core technologies and therefore more and more companies have been integrating GNSS receivers into their consumer products. By considering the large number of available GPS receivers on the market and the lack of standard specifications on the performance, a general evaluation of low cost GPS chipset is very interesting. The present paper describes the performance tests of a set of GPS receivers by different manufacturers in different environmental conditions (outdoor, light indoor, temporary blockage of the signal). The results of the tests are compared with the claimed performance reported on the data sheets. The comparative study on the performance is performed according to different figures of merit: acquisition sensitivity, Time To First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> and the accuracy. Performance of the different receivers were tested by means of a hardware platform and a software tool called Sat-Surf and Sat-Surfer respectivel...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to integrating contemporary technologies proposed to work in different scenarios as standalone or aiding positioning devices. Applications can range from everyday to location based emergency services, LBES. Despite many claims, no GPS chipset or positioning device has performed well in all scenarios ranging from indoors to outdoors and urban to rural, due to factors like multipath, attenuation, satellite unavailability or GPS insensitivity. However, few improvement techniques and mitigation studies have been proposed. With the exponentially increasing demands of quick, efficient and reliable positioning systems, more sophisticated and intelligent systems are required, especially for emergencies. A survey conducted to verify the reliability of existing and in use systems by emergency services revealed the needs for improvement. After reviewing current trends in specific positioning and identifying shortcomings, a hybrid positioning (HP) concept has been proposed. All-Scenario Health Monitoring and Intelligent Positioning System, ASHIPS can potentially provide significant improvements in terms of reliability, time to first <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> and general GPS availability and correction.

40|$|Reliable {{and rapid}} {{ambiguity}} resolution (AR) {{is the key}} to fast precise point positioning (PPP). We propose a modified partial ambiguity resolution (PAR) method, in which an elevation and standard deviation criterion are first used to remove the low-precision ambiguity estimates for AR. Subsequently the success rate and ratio-test are simultaneously used in an iterative process to increase the possibility of finding a subset of decorrelated ambiguities which can be fixed with high confidence. One can apply the proposed PAR method to try to achieve an ambiguity-fixed solution when full ambiguity resolution (FAR) fails. We validate this method using data from 450 stations during DOY 021 to 027, 2012. Results demonstrate the proposed PAR method can significantly shorten the time to first <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> and increase the fixing rate. Compared with FAR, the average TTFF for PAR is reduced by 14. 9 % for static PPP and 15. 1 % for kinematic PPP. Besides, using the PAR method, the average fixing rate can be increased from 83. 5 % to 98. 2 % for static PPP, from 80. 1 % to 95. 2 % for kinematic PPP respectively. Kinematic PPP accuracy with PAR can also be significantly improved, compared to that with FAR, due to a higher fixing rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of current GNSS open service signals {{is the result}} of a design trade-off between several performance figures of merit. The most relevant are position accuracy, receiver sensitivity (for signal acquisition, tracking, and data demodulation), and the time to first <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF).</b> Signal performance generally results from a compromise among those. However, if one concentrates on the signal acquisition phase, the last two factors assume a much higher relevance. Also, the design of the navigation message has to take into account many needs, and the information transmitted has to serve different services and/or classes of users. Again, of all the information present in a typical navigation message, only a portion is relevant to obtain the first position fix within a reasonable amount of time. The main goal of the work described in this article is to propose the design of an acquisition-aiding signal and to discuss the benefits of adding such a signal to the current GNSS baselines. Our work has focused on the Galileo E 1 Open Service (E 1 -OS), but many of the concepts that we will introduce can be easily extended to any GNSS signal. The discussion presented here clearly does not pretend to be a proposal for an actual system implementation. JRC. G. 5 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R
40|$|India has {{successfully}} stepped into satellite Navigation {{system with the}} launch of its first three IRNSS satellites IRNSS 1 A, 1 B and 1 C. IRNSS provides two types of services, Standard Posting Service (SPS), which is open for civilian use and the Restricted Service (RS), for authorized users. The system is set to change the facet of navigation, surveying, transportation, precision agriculture, disaster management and telecommunication in India. In any navigation system, broadcast navigation parameters are of paramount importance in arriving user position solution at user receiver end. IRNSS Navigation data is classified as primary and secondary Navigation parameters. Primary navigation data of a satellite principally represents its own orbit and onboard clock offset {{in the form of}} quasi-keplerian elements and clock coefficients (Bias, Drift and Drifts rate) respectively. Whereas secondary navigation parameters includes satellite almanac, ionosphere delay correction messages, differential corrections, Earth orientation parameters and IRNSS Time offset with respect to other GNSS. In existing IRNSS system satellite ephemeris of primary navigation parameters are broadcast in the form of 15 quasi-keplerian elements valid for a period of 2 hours or more. Spacecraft ephemeris which represents orbit in the form of 9 parameters, i. e., position, velocity and acceleration component of spacecraft in Cartesian coordinate system are chosen from Russian Global Navigation satellite system (Glonass) to improve Time to First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> o...|$|R
40|$|Location Based Systems (LBS) {{market has}} emerged {{exponentially}} since early 2000 {{in the wake}} of growing need for Emergency Relief Applications. The argument of course outstanding is which device outperforms all other in diverse scenarios without failure. While many purpose built LBS are in use, SPOT satellite messenger gained attention for its reliability. This paper summates the system architecture and experimental tests results with those of competing Assisted and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (A/GNSS). Our test bed comprised of 26 test points with pre-established database of GNSS difficulty levels in diverse environments in UNSW. Parameters of interest are availability, accuracy and Time to First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF).</b> Relative benchmarking proves SPOTâ€™s higher TTFF and higher failure rate in general. While High Sensitivity GNSS and Assisted GNSS (MS-Based and MS-Assisted) had higher availability, higher accuracy and lower TTFF. Altogether fewer failure scenarios, trustworthy coverage with cost effectiveness were observed for MS-Based AGNSS which is vital for LBS applications. However reliance on wired or wireless IP network potentially limits the performance in non-existent underlying infrastructure in remote applications. SPOT demonstrated higher TTFF and failure rates in test scenario. On the contrary Assisted GNSS (MS-Based or MS-Assisted) can provide a reliable, cost effective and open source alternative to SPOT satellite messenger with better TTFF, availability and accuracy for consumer and research applications...|$|R
40|$|With the {{inclusion}} of 406 MHz transponders on the Galileo satellites and the new search and rescue (SAR) return link message (RLM) on the open service E 1 B signal, the availability of distress beacons equipped with a Galileo or combined GPS/Galileo receiver will be very important {{in the future to}} take advantage of the SAR RLM, thereby facilitating the rescue operations and helping to identify and reject false alerts. Consequently, this paper provides the status of the development of a flexible Galileo L 1 receiver platform as well as an analysis and comparison of acquisition schemes suitable to be implemented in 406 MHz Cospas-Sarsat distress beacons. For each considered acquisition scheme, we compare the acquisition performance that can be obtained using GPS L 1 C/A or Galileo E 1 B or E 1 C signals and consider and discuss the following main constraints: a very short time to first <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> in cold start conditions (the beaconâ€™s GNSS receiver may not be powered on for years before it is activated in an emergency); a low energy consumption per position fix (the beacon and GNSS receiver are battery powered); a possibly long coherent integration time to achieve synchronization and tracking in harsh environments (e. g., when some or all of the satellite signals are blocked or attenuated by an obstruction); the ability to demodulate the satellites signals in the presence of a 406 MHz/ 5 W and a 121. 5 MHz/(up to 100 mW) beacon transmitters; and a low complexity (low price) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of any Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal {{is one of}} the most important receiver operation. A receiver must be able to identify which satellites are in view as fast as possible in order to reduce the Time To First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF).</b> Moreover, the acquisition must be performed even in weak signal power situation which increase the challenge of this specific receiver function. The acquisition procedure can be split into two main specific functions: the Search Space (SS) evaluation and the signal detection. Different ways of obtaining the SS have been proposed so far as well as solutions to the problem of signal detection, although in literature more time has been devoted to the first problem. In this paper the attention will be focused intensively on the problem of the signal detection, or in other words to the methodology with which a signal coming from a specific satellite is declared present or absent. This paper will investigate a different detection approach not based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion and it will be validated both by means of computer simulations and by using real collected GPS data. The paper will show how the proposed methodology can be successfully employed for the GNSS signal acquisition and how it can be used as an alternative of the coherent and non-coherent extension of the integration time for the detection of weak signals when a collection of measurements is available. The method presented in this paper presents several advantages in terms of robustness and, despite of the difficult mathematical background, its implementation results to be quite straightforwar...|$|R
40|$|Precise point {{positioning}} (PPP) technology is mostly implemented with an ambiguity-float solution. Its performance may be further improved by performing ambiguity-fixed resolution. Currently, the PPP integer ambiguity resolutions (IARs) are mainly based on GPS-only measurements. The integration of GPS and GLONASS can {{speed up the}} convergence and increase the accuracy of float ambiguity estimates, which contributes to enhancing the success rate and reliability of fixing ambiguities. This paper presents an approach of combined GPS/GLONASS PPP with fixed GPS ambiguities (GGPPP-FGA) in which GPS ambiguities are fixed into integers, while all GLONASS ambiguities are kept as float values. An improved minimum constellation method (MCM) is proposed to enhance the efficiency of GPS ambiguity fixing. Datasets from 20 globally distributed stations on two consecutive days are employed to investigate {{the performance of the}} GGPPP-FGA, including the positioning accuracy, convergence time and the time to first <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF).</b> All datasets are processed for a time span of three hours in three scenarios, i. e., the GPS ambiguity-float solution, the GPS ambiguity-fixed resolution and the GGPPP-FGA resolution. The results indicate that the performance of the GPS ambiguity-fixed resolutions is significantly better than that of the GPS ambiguity-float solutions. In addition, the GGPPP-FGA improves the positioning accuracy by 38 %, 25 % and 44 % and reduces the convergence time by 36 %, 36 % and 29 % in the east, north and up coordinate components over the GPS-only ambiguity-fixed resolutions, respectively. Moreover, the TTFF is reduced by 27 % after adding GLONASS observations. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and chi-square two-sample tests are made to examine the significance of the improvement on the positioning accuracy, convergence time and TTFF...|$|R
40|$|The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is {{becoming}} increasingly widespread, especially in the science industry. The effect of additional GNSS systems such as the Russian GLONASS system {{in combination with the}} American Global Positioning System (GPS) is investigated in this research. RTK surveying is an effective means of surveying for a range of applications, which delivers accurate coordinates to the user in real time. It is expected that {{in less than two years}} there will be over 70 satellites in operation from the major satellite systems, GPS, GLONASS, COMPASS and GALILIO. The current operation of RTK GNSS relies largely on research and knowledge obtained from the use of RTK GPS over the last decade. An increase in the number of satellites available will theoretically lead to a higher accuracy and precision, and more effective and efficient surveying tool. Testing has been undertaking to determine how a variation in the number of GLONASS satellites affect the accuracy, precision and Time to First <b>Fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> of a RTK GNSS receiver. The results of this testing suggest that additional satellites do lead to a shorter TTFF, which is backed up by previous research conducted in this area. It also shows that RTK GNSS is at all time high in accuracy when the initialisation integrity is maintained. The precision of RTK GNSS is also quite high when initialisation integrity is maintained, however the results show that the addition of GLONASS satellites does not improve these figures. In fact, the addtion of one or two GLONASS satellites often has an adverse effect, and results in a lesser accuracy and precision. This research shows that RTK GNSS is an accurate and precise tool for surveying if the initialisation integrity is maintained. The addition and variation in the number of GLONASS satellites does not improve accuracy and precision, however results agree with past research thata it will lead to a more robust and reliable solution...|$|R
40|$|Small, aerial {{objects are}} now being {{utilised}} {{in many areas of}} civil object capture and monitoring. As a rule, the standard application of a simple GPS receiver with code solutions serves the 3 D-positioning of the trajectories or recording positions. Without GPS correction information, these can be calculated at an accuracy of 10 â€“ 20 metres. Corrected code solutions (DGPS) generally lie in the metre range. A precise 3 D-positioning of the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) trajectories in the centimetre range provides significant improvements. In addition, the recording time of each sensor can be synchronized with the exact time stamp of the GNSS low-cost system. In recent years, increasing works on positioning from L 1 GPS raw data have been published. Along with this, the carrier phase measurements with the established evaluation algorithms are analysed in the post processing method to centimetre-exact positions or to high-precision 3 D trajectories [e. g. Schwieger and GlÃ¤ser, 2005 or Korth and Hofmann 20011]. The use of reference information from local reference stations or a reference network serves the purpose of carrier phase ambiguity resolution. Furthermore, there are many activities worldwide in the area of PPP techniques (Precise Point Positioning). However, dual frequency receivers are primarily used in this instance. Moreover, very long initialisation times must be scheduled for this. A research project on the subject of low-cost RTK GNSS was developed for real-time applications at the Beuth Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik Berlin University of Applied Sciences [Stempfhuber 2012]. The overall system developed for the purpose of real-time applications with centimetre accuracy is modularly constructed and can be used for various applications ([URL]). With hardware costing a few hundred Euro and a total weight of 500 â€“ 800 g (including the battery), this system is ideally suited for UAV applications. In addition, the GNSS data processed with the RTK method can be provided in standardised NMEA format. Through the reduced shadowing effects of the aerial objects, GNSS external factors such as multipath cause few problems. With L 1 carrier phase analysis, the baseline computation must nevertheless remain limited at the range of a few kilometres. With distances of more than 5 kilometres between the reference station and the rover station position, mistakes arise in the decimetre area. The overall modular system consists of a low-cost, single-frequency receiver (e. g. uBlox LEA 4 T or 6 T receiver), a L 1 antenna (e. g. the Trimble Bullet III), a developed data logger including an integrated WLAN communication module for storage and securing of the raw data as well as a power supply. Optimisation of the L 1 antenna has shown that, in this instance, many problems relating to signal reception can be reduced. A calibration of the choke-ring adaptors for various antenna calibration facilities results in good and homogeneous antenna parameters. In this situation, the real-time algorithm from the Open Source project RTKLib [Takasu, 2010] generally runs on a small computer at the reference station. In this case, the data transfer from the L 1 receiver to the PC is realisable through a serial cable. The rover station can transfer the raw data to the computing algorithm over a WLAN network or through a data radio. Of course, this computational algorithm can also be adapted to an integrated computing module for L 1 carrier phase resolutions. The average time to first <b>fix</b> (<b>TTFF)</b> amounts to a few minutes depending on the satellite constellation. Different test series in movement simulators and in moving objects have shown that a stable, fixed solution is achieved with a normal satellite constellation. A test series with a Microdrones quadrocopter could also be conducted. In comparison of the RTK positions with a geodetic dual frequency receiver, differences are in millimetre ranges. In addition, reference systems (based on total stations) are present for the precise examination of the kinematically captured positioning [Eisenbeiss et al. 2009]...|$|R
