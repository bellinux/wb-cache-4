5|$|Starting with a plea {{from the}} Slovakian rabbi Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl in May 1944, {{there was a}} growing {{campaign}} by Jewish organizations to persuade the Allies to bomb Auschwitz or the railway lines leading <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> one point British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered that such a plan be prepared, but {{he was told that}} precision bombing the camp to free the prisoners or disrupt the railway was not technically feasible.|$|E

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E

5|$|Galland did {{not give}} up. He made {{repeated}} appeals for Me 262 fighter aircraft. Göring refused Galland's requests to have equal numbers of Me 262 fighter and bomber variants built. However, Galland's close relationship with Albert Speer, the German armaments minister, enabled him to retain a small operational number. Even this was difficult, as Hitler had taken personal control of turbo-jet production and checked where each batch of the aircraft were being deployed. It was not until September 1944 that Hitler rescinded his directive that the Me 262 {{be used as a}} fighter-bomber. Galland ignored the order and formed Eprobungskommando 262 to test the Me 262 against high-flying Allied reconnaissance aircraft. He selected the highly decorated pilot Werner Thierfelder as its commander. Hitler heard of the experiment through Milch and ordered Göring to put a stop <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> a meeting on 29 May 1944. Galland persisted with the experiments and ordered operations to be continued. They achieved isolated successes until Thierfelder was shot down and killed by P-51 Mustangs on 18 July 1944. On 20 August, Hitler finally agreed to allow one in every 20 Me 262 to go into service with the Jagdwaffe which allowed Galland to build all–jet units.|$|E
5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

5|$|The Great Salt Lake entered written European history {{through the}} records of Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who learned of its {{existence}} from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time, {{and it was not}} shown on the map by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter other trappers saw it and walked around it.|$|E
5|$|The first Curry Moor {{pumping station}} {{was built in}} 1864, to house a steam engine and pump. A cottage for the {{operator}} was built next <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the same time. This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The steam engine was retained for historical reasons, and is located in {{part of the new}} building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an electric pump in 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included {{the construction of a new}} outfall into the river.|$|E
5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E

5|$|The first {{clash between}} the two armies {{occurred}} on the same evening of 5 October, when Wang sent several hundred of his cavalry to attack Shan Xionxin's camp on the plain. Li sent forces from the hills to his general's aid, but the battle ended quickly {{with the arrival of}} night. This attack {{was nothing more than a}} diversion, drawing Li's attention to the east while, under cover of night, Wang sent 200 of his cavalry around and behind Li's forces. Concealing themselves in a ravine behind Li's camp, they waited. During the night Wang laid bridges across the canal, and before dawn his army crossed over and deployed in battle formation close to Li Mi's camps. At daybreak, Li Mi's troops were caught entirely by surprise at the sight of the battle-ready enemy advancing onto them. As the camps were unfortified, the rebel troops tried to hastily form a battle line themselves, but they were unable to prevent Wang's forces from entering their encampments. At the same time, Wang signalled his hidden cavalry to attack. Charging down from the north into Li Mi's camp, the 200 horsemen began setting fire <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> the sight of the camp to their rear going up in flames, Li Mi's army broke and fled. While Li Mi was able to escape with some 10,000 of his men, many of the rest surrendered to Wang. According to one account, Wang's victory was secured by a stratagem: one of his soldiers, who greatly resembled Li Mi, was bound and displayed to the rebel troops at the height of the battle, whereupon the latter collapsed.|$|E

25|$|A variant {{hemoglobin}}, called {{fetal hemoglobin}} (HbF, α2γ2), {{is found in}} the developing fetus, and binds oxygen with greater affinity than adult hemoglobin. This means that the oxygen binding curve for fetal hemoglobin is left-shifted (i.e., a higher percentage of hemoglobin has oxygen bound <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> lower oxygen tension), in comparison to that of adult hemoglobin. As a result, fetal blood in the placenta is able to take oxygen from maternal blood.|$|E
