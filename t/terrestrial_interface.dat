40|$|International audienceSatellite {{communications}} {{can provide}} fourth generation (4 G) networks with large-scale coverage. However, their integration to 4 G is challenging because satellite networks {{have not been}} designed with handover in mind. The setup of satellite links takes time, and so, handovers must be anticipated long before. This paper proposes a generic scheme based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802. 21 standard to optimize handover and resource management in hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks. Our solution, namely optimized handover and resource management (OHRM), uses the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interface</b> to prepare handover, which greatly speeds up {{the establishment of the}} satellite link. We propose two mechanisms to minimize the waste of bandwidth due to wrong handover predictions. First, we leverage the support of 802. 21 in the terrestrial access network to shorten the path of the signaling messages towards the satellite resource manager. Second, we cancel the restoration of the satellite resources when the terrestrial link rolls back. We use OHRM to interconnect a digital video broadcasting and a wireless 4 G terrestrial network. However for the simulation tool, we use a WiMAX as the terrestrial technology to illustrate the schemes. The simulation results show that OHRM minimizes the handover delay and the signaling overhead in the terrestrial and satellite networks...|$|E

The geographic proximity of ancient limestone reefs and modern reefs in southern Florida provides an ideal location to study coral taphonomy in similar systems separated by over 100, 000 years. Linear transects measuring in-situ coral from living Florida Keys patch reefs (representing the once-living Key Largo Limestone reefs) and in-situ fossilized coral from patch reefs in the Pleistocene Key Largo Limestone at Windley Key, Florida were compared to gauge the extent of alteration with time. The Key Largo Limestone in-situ coral covered ~ 21 % of the formation while the modern in-situ coral counterparts covered ~ 33 %, suggesting that taphonomic processes reduced coral coverage by ~ 38 %.

30|$|One of the {{key factors}} for the {{successful}} deployment of mobile satellite systems in 4 G networks is the maximization of the technology commonalities with the terrestrial systems. An effective way of achieving this objective consists in considering the <b>terrestrial</b> radio <b>interface</b> as the baseline for the satellite radio interface. Since the 3 GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard {{will be one of}} the main players in the 4 G scenario, along with other emerging technologies, such as mobile WiMAX; this paper analyzes the possible applicability of the 3 GPP LTE interface to satellite transmission, presenting several enabling techniques for this adaptation. In particular, we propose the introduction of an inter-TTI interleaving technique that exploits the existing H-ARQ facilities provided by the LTE physical layer, the use of PAPR reduction techniques to increase the resilience of the OFDM waveform to non linear distortion, and the design of the sequences for Random Access, taking into account the requirements deriving from the large round trip times. The outcomes of this analysis show that, with the required proposed enablers, it is possible to reuse the existing <b>terrestrial</b> air <b>interface</b> to transmit over the satellite link.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} element of satellite-supported asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networking will involve support for the routing and rerouting of active connections. Work published {{under the auspices of}} the Telecommunications Industry Association ([URL] describes basic architectures and routing protocol issues for satellite ATM (SATATM) networks. The architectures and issues identified will serve as a basis for further development of technical specifications for these SATATM networks. Three ATM network architectures for bent pipe satellites and three ATM network architectures for satellites with onboard ATM switches were developed. The architectures differ from one another in terms of required level of mobility, supported data rates, supported <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and onboard processing and switching requirements. The documentation addresses low-, middle-, and geosynchronous-Earth-orbit satellite configurations. The satellite environment may require real-time routing to support the mobility of end devices and nodes of the ATM network itself. This requires the network to be able to reroute active circuits in real time. In addition to supporting mobility, rerouting can also be used to (1) optimize network routing, (2) respond to changing quality-of-service requirements, and (3) provide a fault tolerance mechanism. Traffic management and control functions are necessary in ATM to ensure that the quality-of-service requirements associated with each connection are not violated and also to provide flow and congestion control functions. Functions related to traffic management were identified and described. Most of these traffic management functions will be supported by on-ground ATM switches, but in a hybrid terrestrial-satellite ATM network, some of the traffic management functions may have to be supported by the onboard satellite ATM switch. Future work is planned to examine the tradeoffs of placing traffic management functions onboard a satellite as opposed to implementing those functions at the Earth station components...|$|R

The DL channel of an IMT-DS system consists of time-multiplexed pilot and data symbols to facilitate coherent detection. To obtain channel estimates during pilot symbols, we propose a chip level adaptive channel estimation which performs better than the conventional method. For slow fading channels, like a pedestrian channel, zero order interpolation provides satisfactory performance. However, for fast fading channels, a common decision directed algorithm is applied whose performance is limited due to error propagation.

ITU-R held its Radiocommunication Assembly (RA- 07) in Geneva, 15 - 19 October 2007. A major outcome was the change of Study Group (SG) structure by {{reducing the number of}} SGs from seven to six, for example creating one large new SG (SG 5) on terrestrial services by merging fixed and mobile services, previously SGs 9 and 8, respectively. RA- 07 also decided to include a sixth <b>terrestrial</b> air <b>interface</b> in the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) family by including the OFDMA TDD WMAN technology, a WiMAX derived technology. Mobile telecommunications were at centre stage at this RA as the Assembly adopted flexibility by choosing IMT as the root name for IMT collectively. IMT- 2000 technologies as well as coming evolutions of the future IMT are now referred to as IMT.

30|$|Integrated {{terrestrial}} {{and satellite}} communication {{system is a}} paradigm that has been addressed {{for many years and}} that is at the fore front of the research and development activity within the satellite community. The recent development of the DVB-SH standard [1] for mobile broadcasting demonstrates that virtuous synergies can be introduced when terrestrial networks are complemented with a satellite component able to extend their service and coverage capabilities. A key aspect for the successful integration of the satellite and terrestrial components is the maximization of technological commonalities aimed at the exploitation of the economy of scale that derives from the vast market basis achievable by the integrated system. In order to replicate in 4 G networks the success of the integrated mobile broadcasting systems, many initiatives are being carried out [2, 3] for the design of a satellite air interface that maximizes the commonalities with the 4 G <b>terrestrial</b> air <b>interface.</b> These initiatives aim at introducing only those modifications that are strictly needed to deal with the satellite channel peculiarities, such, for example, nonlinear distortion introduced by the on-board power amplifiers, long round-trip propagation times, and reduced time diversity, while keeping everything else untouched. Specifically, it is important to highlight the different mobile channel propagation models between terrestrial and satellite environments. In fact, in terrestrial deployments, channel fades are typically both time and frequency selective, and are counteracted by the use of opportunistic scheduling solutions, which select for each user the time slots and the frequency bands where good channel conditions are experienced. On the other hand, satellite links are characterized by large round trip delay, which hinders the timeliness of the channel quality indicators and sounding signals, continuously exchanged between users and terrestrial base stations. Further, satellite channel fades are typically frequency-flat, due to the almost Line-of-Sight (LOS) nature of propagation in open area environments, thus alternative solutions have to be designed in order to increase the satellite link reliability.|$|R

The terminals have been reduced in size and cost {{over the years and}} new technology has enabled the recent introduction of briefcase sized personal telephony terminals (Inmarsat-M). This trend continues and we are likely to see Inmarsat handheld terminals {{by the end of the}} decade. These terminals are called Inmarsat-P and this paper focuses on the various elements required to support a high quality service to handheld terminals. The main system elements are: the handheld terminals; the space segment with the associated orbits; and the gateways to terrestrial networks. It is both likely and desirable that personal handheld satellite communications will be offered by more than one system provider and this competition will ensure strong emphasis on service quality and cost of ownership. The handheld terminals also have to be attractive to a large number of potential users, and this means that the terminals must be small enough to fit in a pocket. Battery lifetime is another important consideration, and this coupled with radiation safety requirements limits the maximum radiated EIRP. The terminal G/T is mainly constrained by the gain of the omnidirectional antenna and the noise figure of the RF front end (including input losses). Inmarsat has examined, with the support of industry, a number of Geosynchronous (GSO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite options for the provision of a handheld mobile satellite service. This paper describes the key satellite and orbit parameters and tradeoffs which affect the overall quality of service and the space segment costing. The paper also stresses not only the importance of using and sharing the available mobile frequency band allocations efficiently, but also the key considerations affecting the choice of feeder link bands. The design of the gateways and the terrestrial network is critical to the overall viability of the service, and this paper also examines the key technical parameters associated with the Land Earth Stations (LES), which act as gateways into the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). These not only include the design tradeoffs associated with the LES, but also the different <b>terrestrial</b> network <b>interface</b> options.

40|$|At the land-ocean <b>interface,</b> <b>terrestrial</b> {{groundwater}} {{interacts with}} seawater {{to form a}} subterranean estuary, which can play host to dynamic biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, trace metals and radionuclides. This chemically altered groundwater enters the ocean through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), {{a process that is}} driven by a number of physical processes acting on aquifers and the coastal ocean. In this thesis, seasonal variability in chemical cycling and associated loading to the coastal ocean was observed in a monthly time series within the Waquoit Bay (MA, USA) subterranean estuary. The position of the aquifer mixing zone moved seaward with an increase in hydraulic gradient, resulting in low salinity conditions and reduced mixing, while a decrease in gradient led to landward movement, high salinity groundwater and enhanced mixing. At this location, seasonal variability in sea level, not groundwater level, was the dominant variable driving the hydraulic gradient and therefore SGD. Fluxes of sediment bound cations to the ocean increased coincidently with sea level rise due to desorption. There was enhanced nitrogen attenuation during winter, potentially due to longer groundwater residence times, with greater nutrient delivery to coastal waters during the spring and summer bloom. Interannual climate fluctuations that control sea level and precipitation may ultimately control the timing and magnitude of chemical and water flux via SGD. In addition to temporal variability, aquifer lithology influences chemical export. This thesis also demonstrates that SGD from karst subterranean estuaries {{may play a role in}} local and global element budgets. The potential for the chemical signature of SGD to be recorded in the coral record was tested through a combination of coral culture experiments and field and modeling studies in the Yucatan Peninsula. Coral barium was well correlated with precipitation for a twelve-year record, with coral geochemistry reflecting the passage of a hurricane in 2002.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of temporary and perennial river channels in a whole catchment is important for effective integrated basin management and river biodiversity conservation. However, this information is usually not available or is incomplete. In this study, we present a statistically based methodology to classify river segments from a whole river network (Deva-Cares catchment, Northern Spain) as temporary or perennial. This method {{is based on an}} a priori classification of a subset of river segments as temporary or perennial, using field surveys and aerial images, and then running Random Forest models to predict classification membership {{for the rest of the}} river network. The independent variables and the river network were derived following a computer-based geospatial simulation of riverine landscapes. The model results show high values of overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the evaluation of the fitted model to the training and testing data set (? 0. 9). The most important independent variables were catchment area, area occupied by broadleaf forest, minimum monthly precipitation in August, and average catchment elevation. The final map shows 7525 temporary river segments (1012. 5 km) and 3731 perennial river segments (662. 5 km). A subsequent validation of the mapping results using River Habitat Survey data and expert knowledge supported the validity of the proposed maps. We conclude that the proposed methodology is a valid method for mapping the limits of flow permanence that could substantially increase our understanding of the spatial links between <b>terrestrial</b> and aquatic <b>interfaces,</b> improving the research, management, and conservation of river biodiversity and functioning.
