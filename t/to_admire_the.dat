25|$|Since {{at least}} the 12th century the cathedral has been an {{important}} destination for travellers– and remains so to the present, attracting large numbers of Christian pilgrims, many of whom come to venerate its famous relic, the Sancta Camisa, said to be the tunic worn by the Virgin Mary at Christ's birth, as well as large numbers of secular tourists who come <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> cathedral's architecture and historical merit.|$|E
25|$|Many of the then-popular locust {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} Livingston estates to frame the views. The Livingstons, as was {{customary}} for the owners of large country estates at the time, opened their grounds to the public on weekends as parks, and to this end followed Downing's theories of landscaping by building curving paths and rustic benches and shelters from which <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> river and distant mountains.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, on 2 April 1911, a French pilot, Maurice Tétard, {{flying from}} Brooklands to Larkhill, called at North Stoneham {{to make some}} adjustments; although he only stayed for about half an hour, a large inquisitive crowd rapidly gathered <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> plane.

25|$|Juan Domingo Perón's rise {{to power}} in 1946 in Argentina after the war worried many Jews in the country.

Perón introduced Catholic religious instruction in Argentine public schools; he allowed Nazis fleeing prosecution in Germany to immigrate to the country.

The period 1898–1910 was crucial in the history of South Africa and included the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the ensuing peace treaty, and the 1910 formation of the Union of South Africa.

25|$|Celebrated {{as a sign}} of spring, {{snowdrops}} {{can form}} impressive carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised. These displays may attract large numbers of sightseers. There are a number of snowdrop gardens in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Several gardens open specially in February for visitors <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> flowers. Sixty gardens took part in Scotland's first Snowdrop Festival (1 Feb–11 March 2007). Several gardens in England open during snowdrop season for the National Gardens Scheme (NGS) and in Scotland for Scotland's Gardens.

25|$|The {{mountains}} {{have been}} inhabited since Neolithic times {{and a number}} of typical monuments, in particular a series of passage tombs, survive to the present day. The monastery at Glendalough, founded in the late 6th century by Saint Kevin, was an important centre of the Early Church in Ireland. Following the Norman invasion in the 12th century, the Wicklow Mountains became a stronghold and hiding place for Irish clans opposed to English rule. The O'Byrne and O'Toole families carried out a campaign of harassment against the settlers for almost five centuries. Later the mountains harboured rebels during the 1798 Rising. Rebel activity died out after the construction of the Wicklow Military Road {{at the start of the}} 19th century and the mountains began to attract tourists to the ruins at Glendalough and <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> mountain scenery.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Clark {{visited the}} Soviet Union {{for three weeks}} as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers, {{accompanied}} by the Communist writer Judah Waten and the Queensland poet James Devaney, a Catholic of moderate views. The delegation visited Moscow and Leningrad, and Clark also visited Prague on his way home. While Waten wanted him <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> achievements of the Soviet state, Clark {{was more interested in}} attending the Bolshoi Ballet, the Dostoyevsky Museum and the St Sergius Monastery at Zagorsk. Clark annoyed both Waten and his Soviet hosts by asking questions about Boris Pasternak, the dissident Soviet writer who was in trouble for having his novel Doctor Zhivago published in the West. Nevertheless, he was impressed by the material progress of the country after the devastation of World War II and by the limited political liberalisation which was taking place under Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E
25|$|The anchor {{from the}} Sailboat Wreck {{is located on}} the Ocean City Boardwalk. The anchor, which is 2 ½ tons, was {{recovered}} from the Sailboat Wreck in 1870 by the commercial clam vessel Star Light. It is now located on the boardwalk for people <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> history of it. The Atlantic Hotel, located at 401 S Baltimore Ave, is another historical site that is also still open for business. After a fire that destroyed the original and first ever hotel in Ocean City, Maryland, the Atlantic Hotel was rebuilt in 1926 {{and is one of the}} oldest and most historic hotels in Ocean City. The Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum is another historical site originally called the Ocean City Life-Saving Station. The station was part of the coastal system and was important for the saving of vessels and lives in distress. It was built in 1891, and after much debate over having it demolished, the station was saved and eventually dedicated as a museum in 1978. The museum attracts people due to the interesting facts and exhibits of ocean life, nature, and life-saving services.|$|E
25|$|When Walter {{arrives in}} Albuquerque – on his 52nd {{birthday}} – he intimidates Gretchen and Elliott into putting his remaining {{money into a}} trust fund for Walter Jr. He then visits Skyler and gives her the location of Hank's body so she can clear herself as a suspect in his death, and finally admits {{to her that he}} entered the meth business for himself, not his family. As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his children one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, secretly poisoning her with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up in a lab and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously starting a remote machine gun mounted in his car that kills most of Jack's men. Walt and Jesse kill Jack and Todd. Walt urges Jesse to kill him, but Jesse notices Walt had been shot by his own trap and tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been fatally wounded. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die. He exchanges a knowing nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt takes a moment <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> lab equipment that Jesse had been using, and finally succumbs to his wounds and collapses dead on the floor as the police arrive and sweep the lab.|$|E
