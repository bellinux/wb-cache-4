5|$|On March 31, 2012, Edge (with {{his usual}} long hair cut short) was {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian, during WrestleMania XXVIII weekend. Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he was not supposed to be on <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> night, also declaring that he would no longer be under contract with WWE in a couple of days. After this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E

You must manage finances, contract or release Superstars & try to make better matches than your rival brand. At {{the end of the year}} at WrestleMania, Vince McMahon will give The General Manager of the Year award to <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> was able to hold the most fans.|$|E

The show then ended with Mr Onion pulling the 'Off' switch plunging the studio into darkness. A match was then struck revealing Cawood, Suttie, Farley and Deley standing in the darkness. After saying Missed It? Missed Out!', a reference to the show's former catchphrase, they blew the match out sending the studio back into darkness symbolising {{the end of the show}} and the end of an era.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to affix a faux gargoyle to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up the sidewalk on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E

5|$|Spin City {{ran from}} 1996 to 2002 on American {{television}} network ABC. The show {{was based on}} a fictional local government running New York City, originally starring Fox as Mike Flaherty, a Fordham Law School graduate serving as the Deputy Mayor of New York. Fox won an Emmy award for Spin City in 2000, three Golden Globe Awards in 1998, 1999, and 2000, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1999 and 2000. During the third season of Spin City, Fox made the announcement to the cast and crew of <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> he had Parkinson's disease.

He announced that he planned to continue to act and would make guest appearances on Spin City (he made three more appearances on the show during the final season).

5|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{was written}} as the pilot for <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> would {{eventually}} be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The Jerry Seinfeld Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian Jerry Seinfeld to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry David to help him develop it, and they wrote a concept for a special about where comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, upon which the two decided that the project {{was to become a}} pilot for a TV-series, rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life.|$|E
