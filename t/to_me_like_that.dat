500|$|Hannah Levin of the Seattle {{publication}} The Stranger {{analyzed the}} lyrics to the track [...] "Mrs. Jones", calling it a [...] "particularly rattling sketch of {{what appears to be}} a rape scene, with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives: the ugly attacker ("Look into the bloodrot, you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live"), the vengeful victim ("The abortion left an abscess / Don't ever talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> again"), and the supportive narrator ("Just like a pro, she takes off her dress / And she kicks you down in her snow white pumps")." [...] The song also makes direct references to The Ballad of East and West, a poem by Rudyard Kipling, with the line: [...] "East is east and west is west, and mine was you and mine was best", which is a partial quote from the poem.|$|E
500|$|Lauren is {{the most}} famous {{basketball}} player in Australia, a position she reached by 2003. [...] Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, Australia's first player of either gender to play internationally. [...] She was recognised {{as one of the}} world's best basketball players {{by the time she was}} 21. [...] She has been described as Australia's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, and the best female basketball player in the world. [...] She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: [...] "I don't really think about it. Nobody really talks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people who have known me all my life, they see me for who I am, and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They know I have to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Rude Boy" [...] was {{produced}} by Rob Swire and StarGate who co-wrote the song with Rihanna, Ester Dean, and Makeba Riddick. During an interview on the television show, [...] in February 2010, Carr asked Rihanna about the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "Come here Rude Boy, Boy, can you get it up?/Come here Rude Boy, Boy, is you big enough?" [...] Rihanna explained: [...] "When we wrote the song, {{it was kind of}} a freestyle...I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, I just went in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I just ran in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> 'Come here Rude Boy, is you big enough'?, it does sound so disgusting!" [...] She also explained the development of the song, and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the introduction, but because of the song's infectious beat, Rihanna decided to make it the hook instead.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's got {{no right}} <b>to</b> treat <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> My money's {{as good as}} anyone else's. I pay him <b>to</b> teach <b>me.</b> That's not {{teaching}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, sir, {{if you go}} for <b>to</b> {{interrupt}} <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I'll 'ave <b>to</b> {{charge a}} bob for this here valk; I couldn't stand it for sixpence." ...|$|R
60|$|It came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a {{discovery}} <b>that</b> {{none of these}} things existed.|$|R
2500|$|On May 18, 2007, Migden crashed her SUV into a sedan {{which was}} {{stopped at a}} red light, {{injuring}} Ellen Butawan and her 3-year-old daughter, who {{were sent to the}} emergency room. [...] Migden claims that she may have suffered from an adverse response to her leukemia treatment that led her to drive erratically. 911 tapes released in August show other drivers who saw her during her 30-mile trip along I-80 were panicking as they reported seeing her hit the center divider, and repeatedly come close to hitting other cars, before finally hitting one. One motorist claimed Migden told her, [...] "You can't talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I'm a senator." [...] Migden voluntarily ceased driving as she continued to undergo treatment and as medical tests were pursued. Migden claimed that her [...] "wild ride" [...] occurred during state business, so that the Department of General Services paid $335,000 to Butawan in July 2009.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E
60|$|She spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> afore my wife, and in {{two minutes}} they was at it, hammer and tongs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You was sharp, wasn't you, <b>to</b> catch <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> eh?' {{he smiled}} slowly. 'By Ga-ard, you had me fixed proper, proper you had. Darn me, you fixed me up proper--proper, you did.' ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Passionately.] If he {{was going}} <b>to</b> leave <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> why didn't he let me stay with my Chinese mother? Why did he bring <b>me</b> up <b>like</b> a lady? Oh, it was cruel.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s a {{wonderful}} thing to me," [...] said Mr. Negget in a low voice to his pipe, [...] "as they should come to a house with a retired policeman living in it. Looks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> somebody <b>that</b> ain’t got much respect for the police." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Hetta, do {{not speak}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that!</b> Cannot you {{understand}} that when she came here, following me, I could not desert her?' ...|$|E
60|$|Cecily. I don't {{think it}} can be right for you to talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Miss Prism never says such things to me.|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [promptly {{losing her}} temper]. Don't you dare speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> you little minx. Remember {{that you are}} in my house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will go with}} you," [...] I said quietly, [...] "and I hope that, when {{it comes}} to the pinch, your spear will be as sharp as your tongue, Saduko. Only do not speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> lest we should quarrel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you mean}} that, after all, I am {{to be thrown}} off like an old glove? I have had many {{dealings}} with men and have {{found them to be}} false, cruel, unworthy, and selfish. But I have met nothing <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> No man has ever dared <b>to</b> treat <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> No man shall dare.' ...|$|R
60|$|THE WOMAN. Yes: I {{took it from}} a {{man that}} met me. I thought God sent him <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I rode here joyfully {{thinking}} so {{all the time to}} myself. Then I noticed that the child was like lead in my arms. God would never have been so cruel as <b>to</b> send <b>me</b> the horse <b>to</b> disappoint <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not worryin'," [...] she replied; [...] "but {{what does}} that little whelp mean by talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that?</b> I'll swat him one if he isn't careful!" ...|$|E
60|$|THE EDITOR (flushing with rage) For two pins I'd take a turn in {{the arena}} myself to-day, and pay you out for daring to talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Helen, thy bowling is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>Like</b> <b>that</b> wise Alfred Shaw's of yore, Which gently {{broke the}} wickets three: From Alfred few could smack a four: Most {{difficult}} to score! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He used <b>to</b> look at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> at first,' said Attley, with {{a visible}} shudder, 'but {{he gave it}} up after a bit. It's only because you're new to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Adolf's {{face was}} covered {{suddenly}} with crow's-feet. [...] "You {{have no business}} <b>to</b> ask <b>me</b> question <b>like</b> <b>that!</b> I am not paid, sir, to answer question like that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bruce {{claims that}} she does not {{recognise}} Ravens' portrayal of her as a genuine part of her character, but says she is flattered by the attention it provokes. [...] "People don't start salivating when I go into the newsroom. I can't think of anything further from the truth. But if Jan Ravens chose <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> well then: result." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, aye!' he cried. 'He often spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> We were {{at school}} together, he and I. I couldn't turn against his son, you know--his only son, Mr Chuzzlewit!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "WILL it," [...] demanded Mrs. Blossom loudly; [...] "WILL it? I don’t {{think it}} will. How dare you talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> Jim Harris? You {{ought to be}} ashamed of yourself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right-o," [...] said Mr. Hills, {{dropping}} {{into a chair}} by the counter and caressing his moustache. [...] "But you wouldn't speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> if you knew what a terrible day I've had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed! lovely {{was never}} the word for her, to my mind," [...] said Betty; [...] "her face always seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{of one of the}} marble statues I {{remember}} at Vienna; perfect, but clear, cold, and hard. But I am no judge, for I did not love her, and in a child, admiration accompanies affection." ...|$|R
6000|$|Adam's eyes twinkled. [...] "If you go home, {{you may get}} her, and I allow she's {{probably}} {{worth the}} effort, but you're not going <b>to</b> side-track <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> If you quit now, I can buy you out and you'll have something {{to help you make}} another start; afterwards I mayn't be able. You needn't hesitate about taking the money; I guess you've earned it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{what should}} you say if I told you <b>that</b> you looked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a boy <b>that</b> was made {{especially}} to help run a candy counter at a circus, and if I offered the place to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{said there}} WAS? What {{do you talk}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> for, Huck Finn? You wait till I say a thing's got sense in it {{before you go to}} accusing me of saying it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why do {{you let him}} patronize {{you like}} that?' she demanded. 'If anybody came and talked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> about my music, I'd--I'd--I don't know what I'd do. Yes, {{even if he were}} really a great musician.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you talk}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> you young whipper-snapper!" [...] cried the old man. [...] "I know what I'm a-doin'. I'm a-goin' to turn {{you over to}} the town authorities, an' that's {{all there is to}} it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not that, sir. But {{since then}} I've remembered what the young gentlemen"--John and Lawrence were still the [...] "young gentlemen" [...] to Dorcas--"call the 'dressing-up box.' It's {{up in the}} front attic, sir. A great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And it came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> sudden <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{there might be a}} green dress amongst them. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{can go to}} hell! I'll not try to do {{anything}} more for him. I don't care if he is my brother; he has no right <b>to</b> jump on <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> On the night of my return, too. My God! he is a brute, a savage!" ...|$|R
60|$|The day's {{lessons are}} over now, and I {{go back to}} my bait-catching with a new admiration for these winged members of the brotherhood. Perhaps there is also a bit of envy or regret in my {{meditation}} as I tie on a new hook to replace the one that an uneasy eel is trying to rid himself of, down in the mud. If I had only had some one <b>to</b> teach <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I should certainly now be a better fisherman.|$|R
