A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (Københavns Byret), {{it is the largest}} of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør and Tårnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (Sø- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to <b>trade</b> <b>marks,</b> marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (Højesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins Jørgens Gård in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.|$|E

In {{the thesis}} {{entitled}} "Law Protection on <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> and Effort to Prevent <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Right Violation after issue <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law No. 19 / 1992 Jo. <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law No. 14 / 1997 " {{there are three}} important problems exposed. The first problem is about law protection for the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right holder in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law, {{the second is the}} role of government and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, and the third is about consumer's law culture in relation with consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> The law protection for owner or right holder of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> has been regulated comprehensively covering administrative, civil and crime sides in a juridical way which is stated in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law.. From administrative side by implementing constitutive system, the owner of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> is acknowledged and given exclusive right, that is being protected as the one and only person who has the right of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> In case of law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner can do legal remedy through administrative action, sue a person for civil liability as well as crime liability. Based on its authority, the government plays important role in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation. As the authority holder, the government has the rights to make rule and policy on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office the government has a role as <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> administrator, consultant and controller on the use of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> in the community, as well as a law enforcement officer by a way of appointing the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office employee as Civil Investigator. From the analysis of field research result, it is revealed that the cancellation of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> within constitutive system still happens due to weak performance of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> office in examining the substansial requirements during <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registration request. Beside that the absence of implementation guidance of some rules in <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law has influenced law enforcement on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Meanwhile, the lack of knowledge and understanding about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> among law enforcement officer has influenced them in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation. They tend to give minor punishment to those who violate the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law. This condition shows the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection is not effective yet because the role of government through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation, need to be improved. On the other hand, <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation preventing action are also influenced by community's law culture as consumers who consume the goods and the services. The consumer's law culture gives negative response or does not support consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> which happens in the community whose opinion and behaviour do not give symbolical meaning on <b>trade</b> <b>mark,</b> the communal values which consider <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> imitation as something acceptable {{as long as it does}} not harm the consumers, especially their lives, and submissive behaviour to keep peace and harmony in life, and the tendency to avoid conflict in consumer dispute. The community will give positive response or support the consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> if their opinion and behaviour are meaningful on symbolical <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and they realise that <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation considered illegal, since it harms not only the consumers, but also blurs symbolical meaning of a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> since a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> means symbol, prestige, as well as certain lifestyle to the user. ...|$|R
