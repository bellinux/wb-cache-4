5|$|As {{in other}} requiem sharks, the blacknose shark is viviparous: after the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> mother provides nourishment. Off the United States, males {{are thought to}} reproduce every year, while females reproduce every other year.|$|E
5|$|Confederate war finance was {{the various}} means, fiscal and monetary, <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Confederate States of America financed their war effort during the American Civil War. As the war lasted for {{virtually}} the entire existence of the nation, it dominated national finance.|$|E

5|$|I-81, {{like all}} Interstate highways, {{is a part}} of the National Highway System for its entire length. It is the {{shortest}} mainline Interstate in Maryland and contains the shortest portion of I-81 of all six states <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Interstate highway passes. The Interstate was dedicated as Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the whitetip reef shark is viviparous; once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac is converted into a placental connection <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> mother delivers nourishment {{for the remainder of}} gestation. Mature females have a single functional ovary, on the left side, and two functional uteruses. The reproductive cycle is biennial.|$|E
5|$|Near Tilbury, Highway401 {{loses its}} tall wall median barrier and narrows to four lanes, {{following}} lot lines laid between concession roads in a plan designed to limit {{damage to the}} sensitive agricultural lands <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> highway runs.|$|E

5|$|Of all {{the summits}} {{that make up}} the Metacomet Ridge, West Rock, in New Haven, Connecticut, bears special mention because it was not formed by the {{volcanic}} flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous volcanic dike <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> basalt lava floods found access to the surface.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> ootheca is laid.|$|E
5|$|The breech {{refers to}} the mass of solid metal behind {{the bottom of the}} bore {{extending}} {{to the base of the}} breech and including the base ring; it also generally {{refers to the}} end of the cannon opposite the muzzle, i.e., the location where the explosion of the gunpowder begins as opposed to the opening <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> pressurized gas escapes.|$|E

5|$|The {{detachment}} from No. 3 Commando went ashore {{in the first}} wave, securing a bridgehead <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> rest of the force proceeded to advance. By 08:00 on 3 October Termoli had been captured, although counterattacks continued until early on 6 October. Shortly after they received orders {{to return to the}} United Kingdom in order to prepare for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} West Virginia <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> freeway passes is rural and mountainous. There are several {{sections}} that have steep grades, especially near the Cheat River Canyon, {{where there is}} a truck escape ramp in case trucks lose their brakes descending the steep grade.|$|E
5|$|The {{top of the}} egg is {{depressed}} and forms a small central cavity called micropyle <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> egg is fertilised. The micropyle is situated on top in eggs which are globular, conical, or cylindrical; in those eggs which are flattened or lenticular, the micropyle {{is located on the}} outer margin or rim.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} recipe {{variations}} around the traditional ingredients, {{some of which}} include hard-boiled eggs, bacon, onion, mustard or white wine. Other alternatives to the main fish can be crayfish and rabbit or mutton. The stargazy pie is always topped with a pastry lid, generally shortcrust but sometimes puff pastry, <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> fish heads and sometimes tails protrude.|$|E
5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E
5|$|Along with Affleck and {{producers}} Chris Moore and Sean Bailey, Damon founded the production company LivePlanet, <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> four created the Emmy-nominated documentary series Project Greenlight {{to find and}} fund worthwhile film projects from novice filmmakers. The company produced and founded the short-lived mystery-hybrid series Push, Nevada, {{as well as other}} projects. In March 2010, Damon and Affleck teamed up again to create Pearl Street Films, a Warner Bros. based production company.|$|E

5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line stimulated the construction of new areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E

25|$|The Reformed churches {{emphasize}} the , or sacramental presence, of Christ, {{saying that the}} sacrament {{is a means of}} saving grace <b>through</b> <b>which</b> only <b>the</b> elect believer actually partakes of Christ, but merely with the bread and wine rather than in the elements. Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the sacrament but instead affirm that Christ is united to <b>the</b> believer <b>through</b> faith—toward <b>which</b> <b>the</b> supper is an outward and visible aid. This {{is often referred to as}} dynamic presence.|$|R
