In 1988, a US$l5 billion traffic improvement scheme for the holy sites was launched.

A further disaster occurred in 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims suffocated or were crushed to death in one of the new air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels built to shield pilgrims from the heat.

50|$|One of the West's main {{concerns}} was {{the significant}} threat Iraq posed to Saudi Arabia. Following Kuwait's conquest, the Iraqi Army was within easy {{striking distance of}} Saudi oil fields.

Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>had</b> lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran. <b>The</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>had</b> backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of Shia Iran's Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority.

5000|$|... 2011 / 2012: Human Rights Watch accused Saudi Arabia of contravening the Olympic Charter by {{systematically}} preventing {{women from}} practising {{sports in the}} country, and by not allowing Saudi women athletes {{to take part in}} the Olympic Games, thus violating the fourth, sixth and seventh fundamental principles of the Charter, which every member of the Olympic Movement is bound to. This came as Anita DeFrantz, chair of the I.O.C.'s Women and Sports Commission, suggested that the country be barred from participating in the Olympics until it agrees to send women athletes to the Games. I.O.C. spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau, however, indicated that the Committee [...] "would not mandate that <b>the</b> <b>Saudis</b> <b>have</b> female representation in London", arguing that [...] "the I.O.C. does not give ultimatums nor deadlines but rather believes that a lot can be achieved through dialogue".|$|E
