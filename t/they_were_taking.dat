5|$|Louis Stanislas {{travelled}} more through France {{than other}} members of the royal family, who rarely left the Île-de-France. In 1774, he accompanied his sister Clotilde to Chambéry on the journey to meet her bridegroom Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, heir to the throne of Sardinia. In 1775, he visited Lyon and also his spinster aunts Adélaïde and Victoire while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> the waters at Vichy. The four provincial tours that Louis Stanislas took before the year 1791 amounted to a total of three months.|$|E
5|$|Stora Henriksvik, {{also called}} the Bellman museum (Bellmanmuseet) for its small {{permanent}} Bellman exhibition, celebrates his life and work with paintings, replica objects and a beachside café in a 17th-century Stockholm house. The place, beside the beach at Långholm, was in Bellman's time called Lilla Sjötullen (The Small Lake-Customs House) where farmers from Lake Mälaren had to pay a toll on the goods <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> to market in Stockholm's Gamla stan. The place is mentioned in Epistle No. 48, Solen glimmar blank och trind.|$|E

5|$|Bedsitcom {{documented}} {{the lives of}} six young adults living in a loft flat in London. Eight episodes in total were created, which {{were divided into two}} distinct halves. The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel, Paul and Rufus, the three actors, as they lived in the flat with Bob, Dave and Shirine, the three unaware members of the public who believed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> part in a genuine reality TV show. After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt {{the true nature of the}} show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica. These three new cast members remained on Bedsitcom for the final four episodes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Shamrock Rovers {{were granted}} {{land in the}} Dublin suburb of Tallaght {{to build a new}} stadium. On 30 March 2000, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site. However, work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005, South Dublin County Council {{announced}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> back the land that they had granted to the club, as the conditions of the planning permission had not been met. A public consultation process was initiated in July 2005 and a resolution was passed in December 2005 to alter the stadium to accommodate senior GAA games while still having Shamrock Rovers as the preferred tenants. This decision was subject to additional government funding. This funding was not made available and on 13 January 2006 the council voted to proceed with the original plan.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1827, {{the canal}} company {{announced}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> over the River Tone Navigation, {{under the terms}} of their acts of parliament of 1811 and 1824. This they did in November, when William Goodland, the river superintendent, was evicted from his cottage, the tolls were raised again, and maintenance ceased. This action was ruled to be illegal by the Court of King's Bench, as the canal company had not complied with the time limits enshrined in the act, but the canal company held on to the river despite the order to give it back to the conservators. Both sides took their case to the High Court, which ruled that the Conservators should have the river in February 1830. A further series of legal actions followed, after which the canal company attempted to obtain a new act of parliament to obtain the Tone by compulsory purchase. The Conservators then decided to negotiate, and an act of parliament passed in July 1832 authorised the takeover.|$|E

5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart {{were arrested}} on October 22, 2008, {{and found to}} be in {{possession}} of several weapons. The men told authorities of their planned assassination and killing spree, and said they intended to rob a gun store to obtain additional weapons and commit home robberies to help fund the operation. Although the United States Secret Service said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> the plot seriously, authorities were unsure how capable Schlesselman and Cowart were of carrying out the alleged plot. Both plotters pleaded guilty to various federal charges; Judge J. Daniel Breen of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee sentenced Schlesselman to 10 years imprisonment on April 15, 2010, and Cowart to 14 years in prison on October 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Striking the Philippines as {{a rapidly}} {{weakening}} system, Maysak had only minimal {{effects in the}} country, producing strong waves and light rainfall. Across Aurora and Isabela provinces, a total of 2,761people were directly affected by the storm, {{most of whom were}} evacuated prior to Maysak's landfall. No damage or loss of life was reported; however, four people were injured after waves generated by Maysak hit them while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> selfies along the shoreline of Dipaculao town in Aurora province on April4. An overloaded, unregistered ferry capsized off Sulu Province in Mindanao on April3, resulting in five deaths. The Philippine Coast Guard stated that seas at the time were calm and the sinking likely resulted from overcrowding of the vessel rather than Typhoon Maysak.|$|E
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E

5|$|The {{reforms of}} the {{execution}} movement had clearly established the Sejm as the central and dominant organ of state power. But this situation in reality had not lasted very long, as various destructive decentralizing tendencies, steps taken by the szlachta and the kings, were progressively undermining and eroding the functionality and primacy of the central legislative organ. The resulting void was being filled during the late 16th and 17th centuries by the increasingly active and assertive territorial sejmiks, which provided a more accessible and direct forum for szlachta activists to promote their narrowly conceived local interests. Sejmiks established effective controls, in practice limiting the Sejm's authority; themselves <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> on an ever-broader range of state matters and local issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the new canal were marred by legal {{disputes}} with the Conservators of the River Tone. The connection to the Tone at Taunton had been made forcibly, by the Canal Company breaching the bank of the river. In August 1827 they announced that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> over the Tone, and evicted William Goodland, the river superintendent, from his cottage. Despite a ruling by the Court of King's Bench that their action was illegal, the Canal Company held on to the river until a High Court judgement in February 1830. The Conservators promptly built a dam, to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal, which they removed after further legal action and an Order of the Chancery Court. Reconciliation finally came in late 1831, when the two parties proposed a new Act of Parliament to authorise the sale of the Tone Navigation to the Canal Company. This was obtained in July 1832, and required the Canal Company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing North Town Bridge, which hampered access to the wharfs in Taunton. They also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at French Weir, to connect with the Grand Western Canal, while the Conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal, and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order.|$|E
