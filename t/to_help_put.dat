5|$|Both ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Germany's African colonies and in Asia and the Pacific. Their service lives were generally uneventful, apart from the normal routine of colonial policing. They were both sent to German East Africa <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>put</b> down the Abushiri Revolt in 188990, and Schwalbe joined the Eight Nation Alliance against the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. Both ships were decommissioned by 1911 and were thereafter used for secondary roles: Schwalbe as a training ship and Sperber as a target ship. After World War I, both vessels were sold and broken up for scrap by 1922.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey (c.1152– 12 December 1212) was {{an illegitimate}} son of Henry II, King of England, who became bishop-elect of Lincoln and {{archbishop}} of York. The identity {{of his mother}} is uncertain, but {{she may have been}} named Ykenai. Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, though he was not ordained as a priest until 1189. In 1173–1174, he led a campaign in northern England <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>put</b> down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of William, King of Scots. By 1182, Pope Lucius III had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be consecrated as bishop; he chose to resign and became Chancellor instead. He {{was the only one of}} Henry II's sons present at the king's death.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, Seeadler was recalled to Tsingtau to be prepared for any possible hostilities involving Germany. During this period, Cormoran was replaced by Condor; the two cruisers were joined by Seeadlers old consort from East Africa, the survey vessel Möwe. In early 1905, Seeadler conducted goodwill visits to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), before returning to Tsingtau in April. On 28 June, with the Russo-Japanese War winding down following the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima, Seeadler was detached from the East Asia Squadron, permitting her return to the South Seas Station. While en route to her station area, Seeadler received an order to return to Africa during a stop at Ponape on 20 August. Her presence was necessary there <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>put</b> down a major uprising, the Maji Maji Rebellion, that had broken out in July. Seeadler ran aground twice, at Labuan and Singapore, on her way to East Africa, but neither incident resulted in damage to the ship. She arrived in Dar es Salaam on 1 October.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after their}} {{delivery}} in 1910, both Minas Geraes and São Paulo were embroiled in the Revolt of the Lash (Revolta da Chibata), {{in which the}} crews of four Brazilian ships demanded the abolition of corporal punishment in the navy. The mutineers surrendered after four days, when a bill was passed granting amnesty to all those involved. In 1922, the two battleships were used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>put</b> down a revolt at Fort Copacabana. Two years later, lieutenants on São Paulo mutinied but found little support from other military units, so they sailed to Montevideo, Uruguay, and obtained asylum. Minas Geraes was modernized in the 1930s, but both battleships were too old to participate actively in the Second World War, and instead were employed as harbor defense ships in Salvador and Recife. São Paulo was sold in 1951 to a British shipbreaker, but was lost in a storm north of the Azores while being towed to its final destination. Minas Geraes was sold to an Italian scrapper in 1953 and towed to Genoa the following year.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th February 1915, the Third Squadron of the Japanese Navy {{received}} a telegram from the Military Attaché Araki Jiro via Ma-Kung in the Formosa Straits (the main {{base of the}} Squadron) requesting for Japanese help. The Otowa and Tsushima were sent immediately for Singapore. Although help was sent and well received by the British Navy in Singapore, the Japanese Navy was hesitant about doing so initially. Commanding Officer of the Third Squadron, Rear Admiral Tsuchiya Mitsukane had apparently expressed his displeasure in dispatching help as he believed that being a signatory of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan should not interfere {{in the internal affairs}} of another country without attaching collateral conditions. Also, Tsuchiya had recalled how a British ship once anchored at Chilung refused <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>put</b> down a Taiwanese revolt on Japan. Seeing that Tsuchiya had no choice but to follow orders from the Japanese Government and Naval Headquarters, Tsuchiya secretly advised his land force not to kill or wound any sepoy intentionally but to simply encourage them to surrender as the former had no enmity with the latter. According to The General Staff of the British Military Headquarters, “in reality the Japanese did not do much…and it was found desirable to disband them as early as possible”. However, from the point of view of Japanese politicians, Japan’s entry into the mutiny was also a form of projecting Japanese power and strength in the region.|$|E

25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914, Harris did not learn of it for nearly a month, being out in the bush at the time.

He quickly attempted to join the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, which had been raised by the British South Africa Company administration <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>put</b> down the Maritz Rebellion in South Africa, but he found that only two positions were available; that of a machine-gunner or that of a bugler.

25|$|The Despotate of the Morea bordered the {{southern}} Ottoman Balkans. The Ottomans had already invaded the region under Murad II, destroying the Byzantine defences — the Hexamilion wall — at the Isthmus of Corinth in 1446. Before the final siege of Constantinople Mehmed ordered Ottoman troops {{to attack the}} Morea. The despots, Demetrios Palaiologos and Thomas Palaiologos, brothers of the last emperor, failed to send any aid. Their own incompetence resulted in an Albanian-Greek revolt against them, during which they invited in Ottoman troops <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>put</b> down the revolt. At this time, a number of influential Moreote Greeks and Albanians made private peace with Mehmed. After more years of incompetent rule by the despots, their failure to pay their annual tribute to the Sultan, and finally their own revolt against Ottoman rule, Mehmed entered the Morea in May 1460. Demetrios ended up a prisoner of the Ottomans {{and his younger brother}} Thomas fled. By {{the end of the summer}} the Ottomans had achieved the submission of virtually all cities possessed by the Greeks.|$|E
