For {{the most}} part, television networks were established based on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute {{a large percentage}} of Japanese television show. According to the 2015 NHK survey on <b>television</b> <b>viewing</b> in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television every day.

5|$|The World Series {{started on}} a Tuesday for the second {{straight}} year, instead of a Wednesday as in the past. The practice was to avoid games on Thursday and Monday nights, generally big days of <b>television</b> <b>viewing,</b> where Fox's telecast would face stiff competition from Thursday Night Football, ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime, various popular primetime entertainment shows, and Monday Night Football.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{conducted}} research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations {{conducted by the}} Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons to measure the program's educational effectiveness. CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers' attention to the program. Based on these findings, the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly. The formative research on Sesame Street {{was the first time}} children's <b>television</b> <b>viewing</b> was studied scientifically.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amount of time children spend in leisure reading and the variables of reading achievement, reading attitude, amount of <b>television</b> <b>viewed,</b> access to interesting materials in the home, competing leisure interests and gender. The subjects were 115 Year 6 children from 4 classes in Perth 2 ̆ 7 s northern suburbs. Reading achievement was measured using PAT Comprehension and PAT Vocabulary, Form A, Part 5. The Elementary Reading Attitude Survey measured attitude to recreational reading and attitude to academic reading, The Leisure Activities Questionnaire provided information on the amount of time devoted to leisure reading, the amount of <b>television</b> <b>viewed,</b> out-of school activities, reading materials and whether leisure reading could be increased. The study was a correlational and comparative group design. The results showed that there was a wide variation in the extent of recreational reading (ERR) and the mean was found to be 26 minutes per day, The best predictor of ERR was attitude to recreational reading (r=. 514), There were significant positive correlations between ERR and both measures of attitude to reading and reading comprehension, and a significant negative correlation between ERR and the amount of <b>television</b> <b>viewed.</b> The multiple regression revealed that attitude to recreational reading, amount of <b>television</b> <b>viewed</b> and level of comprehension together accounted for 29. 6...|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining <b>television</b> <b>viewing,</b> books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E

25|$|As women {{increasingly}} worked {{outside of}} the home, daytime <b>television</b> <b>viewing</b> declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group that soap opera advertisers pay the most for. Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track <b>television</b> <b>viewing</b> outside the home. The rise of cable and the internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama. An early term for the reality TV genre was docu-soap. A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some public}} {{critique}} regarding accuracy and potential bias within Nielsen's rating system, including some {{concerns that the}} Nielsen ratings system is rapidly becoming outdated because of new technology like smartphones, DVRs, tablet computers and Internet streaming services as preferred or alternative methods for <b>television</b> <b>viewing.</b> In June 2006, however, Nielsen announced a plan to revamp its entire methodology to include all types of media viewing in its sample.|$|E

In the 1970s, videotape entered home use, creating the home video industry and changing the economics of the television and movie businesses. The <b>television</b> industry <b>viewed</b> videocassette recorders (VCRs) as having the power to disrupt their business, while <b>television</b> users <b>viewed</b> the VCR as the means to take control of their hobby.|$|R

25|$|A related {{criticism}} of the Nielsen ratings system is its lack of a system for measuring television audiences in environments outside the home, such as college dormitories, transport terminals, bars, jails and other public places where television is frequently viewed, often by {{large numbers of people}} in a common setting. In 2005, Nielsen announced plans to incorporate viewing by away-from-home college students into its sample. Internet <b>television</b> <b>viewing</b> is another rapidly growing market for which Nielsen ratings fail to account for viewers. iTunes, Hulu, YouTube, and some of the networks' own websites (such as ABC.com and CBS.com) provide full-length web-based programming, either subscription-based or ad-supported. Though web sites can already track popularity of a site and the referring page, they cannot track viewer demographics. To both track this and expand their market research offerings, Nielsen purchased NetRatings in 2007. However, as noted in a February 2012 New York Times article, the computer and mobile streams of a program are counted separately from the standard television broadcasts, further degrading the overall quality of the sampling data. As a result, there was no way for NBC to tell if there was any overlap between the roughly 111.3 million traditional television viewers and 2.1 million live stream viewers of Super Bowl XLVII.|$|E
