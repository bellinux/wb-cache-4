5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} sign of <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour {{itself and the}} following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E
5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} {{a period of}} calm, since the sources are silent on any military operations in Sicily. This was probably chiefly due to internal turmoil in Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, as well as <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, {{after the death of}} Louis II, when they took possession of Bari.|$|E

5|$|The action, {{and that}} of with the earlier Action of 26 July 1806, {{demonstrated}} <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch squadron in the East Indies and convinced Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to lead an operation against Batavia to eliminate {{the remainder of the}} Dutch squadron in November 1806. This second raid was only partially successful, and was followed a year later by a raid on the harbour of Griessie, in which the last Dutch warships in the East were eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Accusing the Song {{of violating}} the {{agreement}} and realizing <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force {{in charge of the}} siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E

To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, October 25 is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.|$|E

5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just like it was done with the later Bessys, but <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} in winning the war, William had far less success in {{restoring}} royal power following the peace. In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons {{that they would be}} rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and wardships, but with little success. Nonetheless, William was able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests. The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Crown.|$|E
5|$|Facing continual {{threats from}} the Acrocanthosaurus, Red, {{her sister and}} the chicks are forced up into the mountains. They {{encounter}} ice and snow for the first time, and kill a segnosaur in a cave, turning the den into their nest. The older chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed diplodocid who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; the older chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack's food. This calamity coincides {{with the arrival of}} a large pack of smaller raptors known as Deinonychus. Sensing <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Utahraptor pack, they surround the nest and wait for the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.|$|E

5|$|For the French, {{despite their}} success earlier at Frauenfeld, {{the action was}} {{considerably}} less successful. In the clash, Ney was sufficiently wounded that he took immediate leave, and remained out of action and command until 22 July. The conduct of the battle also demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French command system in which personal animosity and competition between high-ranking officers, in this case, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military objectives. Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders to move his division to Ney's flanks.|$|E
5|$|However {{the series}} of power struggles between the lesser nobility (szlachta), the higher nobility (magnates), and elected kings, {{undermined}} citizenship values and gradually eroded the government's authority, ability to function and provide for national defense. The infamous liberum veto procedure was used to paralyze parliamentary proceedings beginning {{in the second half}} of the 17th century. After {{the series of}} devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the Chmielnicki Uprising and the Deluge), Poland-Lithuania stopped being an influential player in the politics of Europe. During the wars the Commonwealth lost an estimated 1/3 of its population (higher losses than during World War II). Its economy and growth were further damaged by the nobility's reliance on agriculture and serfdom, which, combined with <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban burgher class, delayed the industrialization of the country.|$|E
5|$|However, Denmark was not keen on peace {{after their}} recent successes and {{witnessing}} <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swedish efforts. The Netherlands withdrew their blockade, but were soon convinced by Denmark {{to support them}} again. France and England intervened for Sweden and the situation was again teetering {{on the edge of}} a major conflict. However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish dominium maris baltici.|$|E

5|$|Meckiff had {{performed}} strongly in his debut first-class season, ending with 27 wickets {{at an average}} of 23.66. He was the ninth-highest wicket-taker for the Australian summer and his average was superior to all eight bowlers who took more wickets. At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957. The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand team.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin to block a cannon shot or for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E
5|$|On {{top of the}} Przeworsk culture's {{internal}} {{crisis situation}} came external pressures, namely the massive migration of peoples. At around 370 AD the Huns crossed the Volga River, defeating the Alans and then the Ostrogoths, causing in 375 the fall of their state located in the Black Sea shores region. This unleashed a domino effect, as various Germanic peoples moved west and south to avoid the danger. The Visigoths and others retreated, forcing further migrations, while <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire encouraged encroachments of its territory, the whole scenario resulting {{in the fall of}} its western part. The paths of this Great Migration of Peoples led in part through the Polish lands, and the Germanic tribes living here joined the movement themselves, with the result of an almost complete, {{in the course of the}} 5th century, depopulation of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Pressure from {{consistent}} pro-Nasser {{demonstrations in}} northern Syria and Damascus and from pro-union Ba'athist leaders like Jamal al-Atassi, the Nasserists and the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), coupled with <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ba'athists at the popular level in Syria, led to unification efforts {{between the new}} government and the governments of Egypt and Iraq. The latter's anti-UAR government had also been overthrown by pro-UAR officers in 1963.

5|$|Resistance to the Persians in Syria was not strong; {{although}} the locals constructed fortifications, they generally tried {{to negotiate with}} the Persians. The cities of Damascus, Apamea, and Emesa fell quickly in 613, giving the Sasanian army a chance to strike further south into Palaestina Prima. Nicetas continued to resist the Persians but was defeated at Adhri'at. He managed to win a small victory near Emesa, however, where both sides suffered heavy casualties—the total death count was 20,000. More seriously, <b>the</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resistance enabled the Persians and their Jewish allies to capture Jerusalem following a three weeks siege. Ancient sources claim 57,000 or 66,500 people were slain there; another 35,000 were deported to Persia, including the Patriarch Zacharias.|$|E
