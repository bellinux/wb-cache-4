40|$|The {{development}} of broadband networks and services {{has led to}} the need for improved signalling capabilities. Standards bodies such as the ITU-T have attempted to extend existing signalling protocols in order to provide the extra functionality required. However, a number of <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organisations</b> felt that a more radical approach to connection management was required. The OPENSIG Project at Columbia University, USA, provides an example of such an approach. This paper first introduces the needs of broadband signalling. We then critically discuss the approach taken by the standards bodies, introducing the work of the OPENSIG project as a far reaching approach to connection management within broadband networks...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between environmental uncertainty and business-level strategy has received less attention in developing economies, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this thesis is to examine perceived uncertainty in a developing country to find out how organisations strategically respond to this phenomenon. Using a purposive sample method, one of the six licensed <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organisations</b> in Ghana was selected for an in-depth case study. The qualitative research method was used for data collection and analysis. The results showed that the high level of perceived uncertainty in the telecommunications business environment in Ghana influenced the organisation to adopt informal planning, focused on short-term objectives in order to respond quickly to the turbulent and unpredictable environment. The study concluded that customer behaviour, economic instability and regulatory environment were the most influential external environmental factors that affected strategic decisions in the telecommunications sector in sub-Saharan Africa. In exploring the relationship between environmental uncertainty and business-level strategy the study found a link between environmental uncertainty and the selection of business-level strategy in an organisation in sub-Saharan Africa. The result of the study contributed to the debate in the literature that the strategic response to the perception of the environment by managers in sub-Saharan Africa operating in a different cultural backgrounds was not different from managers in the developed world...|$|R

5000|$|In 2002, {{researchers}} at Gamos and the Commonwealth <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Organisation,</b> funded by Department for International Development UK (DFID), documented that in Uganda, Botswana and Ghana, people were spontaneously using airtime {{as a proxy}} for money transfer. [...] Kenyans were transferring airtime to their relatives or friends who were then using it or reselling it. Gamos researchers approached MCel in Mozambique, and in 2004 MCel introduced the first authorised airtime credit swapping - a precursor step towards M-Pesa. The idea was discussed by the Commission for Africa and DFID introduced the researchers to Vodafone who had been discussing supporting microfinance and back office banking with Mobile phones. S Batchelor (Gamos) and N Hughes (Vodafone CSR) discussed how a system of money transfer could be created in Kenya. DFID amended the terms of reference for its grant to Vodafone, and piloting began in 2005. A student from Moi University in Kenya came up with a mobile software that could allow people to send, receive, and withdraw money from their mobile devices. Safaricom however convinced the student and bought the rights of ownership of this project hence becoming the sole owners of the patent rights. In April 2007, following a student software development project from Kenya, Safaricom launched a new mobile phone-based payment and money transfer service, known as M-Pesa.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the early}} CTI vendors and {{developers}} have changed hands over the years.

In 2004, MIC issued its [...] "Ubiquitous Japan" [...] (u-Japan) policy. Its goal is to achieve a ubiquitous network society in which anything and anyone can easily access networks and freely transmit information from anywhere at any time by 2010. MIC is reviewing its regulations regarding broadband as part of its work towards achieving that goal.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2003 This {{qualitative}} study aims to understanding better, managers' perceptions of organisational learning in a field-based department, within a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organisation.</b> The research provides adult educators with insights into managers' perceptions of how learning is diffused throughout an organisation {{and the impact}} on the learning process. Seven team managers within a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organisation</b> participated in semi-structured interviews exploring to what extent they perceived organisational learning as a significant workplace experience for them. The theoretical basis for the interviews included areas of individual and collective learning, factors affecting organisational learning, the role of organisational memory, and roles in the process of collective learning. Conclusions from the study may assist educators and others in designing more effective organisational learning programs. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|E
40|$|The Halfway Proposition: A {{strategy}} for reducing African international Internet bandwidth costs, Richard Bell, ICT Development Agenda, Commonwealth <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Organisation,</b> November 2002. G- 8 governments have long lamented {{the digital divide}} in Africa without fully acknowledging that its existence is {{to a large extent}} the result of fallout from their policies on globalisation and free trade. ISPs in Africa must pay more for their upstream international bandwidth than their counterparts in G- 8 countries. These reverse subsidies are costing the continent anything between US$ 250 m and US$ 500 m per annum. The report highlights the deep-rooted contradiction between prevailing policies and digital divide doctrine, identifies the root cause of the digital divide, and proposes a plan of action to level the playing field.
