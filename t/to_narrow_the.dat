This qualitative single-case study of a high-poverty, high-performing middle school focused on the cultural norms, practices, and programs that were perceived to be contributing <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> <b>the</b> achievement gap. Through interviews, observations, a survey of certificated staff, and review of school documents, the factors that were perceived to increase academic performance of Hispanic, low-income, and English Learner students were explored.; The cultural norms of a compelling mission of inclusion, equity and access, high expectations, shared leadership, and collaboration were perceived <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> <b>the</b> gap. The practices of data analyses, standards alignment of curriculum, instruction, assessment and grading, school-wide instructional strategies, consistently enforced discipline practices, and strong student/staff relationships were perceived <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> <b>the</b> gap. Programs at the selected school were perceived as only moderately contributing <b>to</b> <b>narrowing</b> <b>the</b> achievement gap. A significant percentage of school staff, united by a compelling mission and provided with access to current accurate student achievement data, collaborate to develop solutions that address learning needs of students. Sustaining practices included intentional acculturation of new staff members to believe in a compelling mission, district office support and goal alignment, and time reserved for collaborative data analysis...|$|R

In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26–10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Forté's two-point conversion allowed the Bears <b>to</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>the</b> gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints.
