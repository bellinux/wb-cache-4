5|$|Ruby is then {{seen in a}} {{hospital}} bed, with Kevin by her side. When questioned about her experience, {{she says she was}} told by an unnamed group not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> Darlene also refuses to cooperate any further, given the ridicule that she faced after her experiences. Back in Washington, Scully listens to a tape of hypnotic sessions in which Mulder recalls the night his sister vanished. Mulder, meanwhile, sits in a church, crying as he looks at a picture of his sister.|$|E
5|$|LeChuck's advances, he {{nevertheless}} pursues {{her love}} and aims to impress her by discovering {{the secret of}} Monkey Island. The exhibition ultimately costs LeChuck his life, but he returns as a ghost still intent on marrying Elaine. LeChuck's ambitions for Elaine's hand in marriage—whether given willingly or not—form {{a major part of}} the franchise's plot. Elaine first encounters Guybrush when he breaks into the governor's mansion on Mêlée Island in an attempt to steal a valuable idol. Elaine has been fascinated to meet Guybrush since hearing of his arrival on the island and his strange name, however, their first meeting is stunted by Guybrush being too awestruck by Elaine's beauty <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> intelligible. When the local sheriff tries to drown Guybrush after a fight, Elaine nevertheless rushes to his aid, confessing that she feels deeply attracted to Guybrush, which he reciprocates. She implores Guybrush to finish his pirate trials before they act on their new-found love, but is kidnapped by LeChuck and taken to his hideout on Monkey Island when the ghost pirate's crew suddenly raids the island. Guybrush mounts a rescue attempt, but fails to reach Elaine before LeChuck's ship returns to Mêlée Island for LeChuck's wedding to Elaine. The well-intentioned Threepwood gatecrashes the wedding, but in actuality ruins Elaine's own plan to defeat LeChuck with an anti-ghost concoction. Guybrush still manages to destroy LeChuck, and the game closes with the happy couple watching the fireworks as the evil pirate's ghost form explodes.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of {{which more than}} 30 are severely damaged. It is very hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about this fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.|$|E

25|$|Although Cage started {{painting}} in his youth, {{he gave it}} up in order to concentrate on music instead. His first mature visual project, Not Wanting <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Anything</b> About Marcel, dates from 1969.

The panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} issues that the Court did not address in Quanta. One such omission is the Court’s failure <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the other possible formats that this transaction might have used—such as a sale by a manufacturing licensee with a limitation on its grant, or (alternatively) a sale by the patentee or its licensee with explicit restrictions imposed on the buyer's freedom to dispose of the product. The Court did not explain whether or in what circumstances these other formats would be legally effective.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her {{apartment}} by the KGB. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the Korean poet Won Tu-Son. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya {{was taken to the}} Lubyanka Prison and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the GULAG.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the problem}} in this debate {{revolved}} around the high level of abstraction and idealization that occurs in economic model-building on topics such as capital and economic growth. The original neoclassical models of aggregate growth presented by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan were straightforward, with simple results and uncomplicated conclusions which implied predictions about the real, empirical, world. The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that more sophisticated and complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E

A kind girl, she is the first of his family to unintentionally witness his power as he takes her to a Viking battle where she rescues a lost kitten. She {{promises}} not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to anyone else, showing her and Will's close relationship. This is seen further when Will is threatened with the death of the person he loves most, and this person turns out to be Gwen.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is {{associated}} with the highest placental exposure of any atypical antipsychotic. Despite this, the available evidence suggests it is safe during pregnancy, although the evidence is insufficiently strong <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> {{with a high degree of}} confidence. Olanzapine {{is associated}} with weight gain which according to recent studies may put olanzapine-treated patients' offspring at a heightened risk for neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida). Breastfeeding in women taking olanzapine is advised against due to the fact that olanzapine is secreted in breast milk with one study finding that the exposure to the infant (in mg per kg of body weight, that is) is about 1.8% that to the mother.|$|E

25|$|Otto Berman, {{the oldest}} and least {{physically}} fit of the four men, {{was the first to}} die, at 2:20 that morning. At the hospital, Landau and Rosencrantz waited for surgery and refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to the police until Schultz arrived and gave them permission; even then, they provided the police with only minimal information. Abe Landau died of exsanguination eight hours after the shooting. Meanwhile, Rosencrantz was taken into surgery; the doctors, incredulous that Rosencrantz was still alive despite voluminous blood loss and ballistic trauma, were unsure of how to treat him. He survived for 29 hours after the shooting before succumbing to his injuries.|$|E
25|$|In many {{of those}} reports, {{including}} a related article in the October 8 edition of the Times, it was also indicated that Baylor had either been fired, resigned, or retired, depending on the source. According to similar reports, Baylor had been offered a different position in the organization, with the same salary, but with little to no decision-making power; Baylor refused. In fact, when pressed about his status with the franchise, Baylor had been advised by his attorneys not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> indicating that the team and Baylor are in negotiations {{to work out a}} settlement agreement based on his departure. According to the above-mentioned article, Baylor had been working without a formal contract since the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{testified that}} he then endured five days of {{derogatory}} comments about himself, his beliefs, his girlfriend and his pastor, and diatribes by Ross {{about the ways in}} which Christianity and conservative Protestantism were wrong. He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a chance <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E

I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us.

25|$|Gandalf leaves after {{showing the}} group the {{path through the}} forest and warning them never to leave it. After several days, however, the dwarves are running low on supplies, and see a group of Wood Elves enjoying a feast. They run into the forest towards the elves, but become lost and separated. Bilbo {{encounters}} Corwin (Michael Ensign), a man from Lake-town, whose party has been killed by the Great Spiders living in the forest, and who have also taken the dwarves. Bilbo is able to rescue them, {{but as soon as}} he does so, the dwarves are captured by Wood Elves and placed in the dungeons of Thranduil, who wants to know why they are in the forest. Thorin, however, refuses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> enraging Thranduil. Using the ring, Bilbo enters Thranduil's hall, where he meets Lianna. With her assistance, he is able to free the dwarves by sealing them into barrels which are sent down the river to Lake-town.|$|E
25|$|King Lear of Britain, {{elderly and}} wanting to retire from {{the duties of the}} monarchy, decides to divide his realm among his three daughters, and {{declares}} he will offer the largest share to the one who loves him most. The eldest, Goneril, speaks first, declaring her love for her father in fulsome terms. Moved by her flattery Lear proceeds to grant to Goneril her share as soon as she has finished her declaration, before Regan and Cordelia have a chance to speak. He then awards to Regan her share as soon as she has spoken. When it is finally the turn of his youngest and favorite daughter, Cordelia, at first she refuses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> ("Nothing, my Lord") and then declares there is nothing to compare her love to, nor words to properly express it; she speaks honestly but bluntly, which infuriates him. In his anger he disinherits Cordelia and divides her share between Regan and Goneril.|$|E
