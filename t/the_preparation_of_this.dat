In <b>the</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> salt, it is preferable to mix the component solutions in the cold, and to evaporate them at a temperature not exceeding 60°C. 100 parts of water dissolve 110 parts of sodium alum at 0°C, and 51 parts at 16°C. Soda alum is used in the acidulent of food {{as well as in the}} manufacture of baking powder.|$|E

2500|$|Truman {{was less}} than enthused about the large defense cost {{projections}} for NSC-68 {{and its implications for}} existing domestic budgetary spending priorities, and initially sent it back without comment to its authors for further analysis. [...] Although Truman took no immediate formal action on NSC 68, the paper gained considerable support when the North Koreans attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950. Johnson's obstinate attitude toward the State Department role in <b>the</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper adversely affected his relations with both Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Truman. Although Johnson publicly professed belief that [...] "the advance guard in the campaign for peace that America wages today must be the State Department," [...] his disagreements with Acheson and his restrictions on DoD contacts with the State Department persisted until the realities of the Korean War caused his fall from favor with the White House.|$|E

Urmand, and show a copy of the letter to her uncle when the post should have taken it so far out of Granpere on its way to Basle, as to make it impossible that her uncle should recall it. Much of the day after George's departure, and much of the night, was spent in <b>the</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> letter. Marie Bromar was not so well practised in the writing of letters as will be the majority of the young ladies who may, perhaps, read her history. It was a difficult thing for her to begin the letter, and a difficult thing for her to bring it to its end. But the letter was written and sent. The post left Granpere at about eight in the morning, taking all letters by way of Remiremont; and on the day following George's departure, the post took Marie Bromar's letter to M. Urmand.|$|E
