5|$|Peters first {{performed}} on the stage {{as a child and}} then a teenage actress in the 1960s, and in film and television in the 1970s. She was praised for this early work and for appearances on The Muppet Show, The Carol Burnett Show and in other television work, and for her roles in films like Silent Movie, <b>The</b> <b>Jerk,</b> Pennies from Heaven and Annie. In the 1980s, she returned to the theatre, where she became one of the best-known Broadway stars over the next three decades. She also has recorded six solo albums and several singles, as well as many cast albums, and performs regularly in her own solo concert act. In the 2010s, Peters continues to act on stage, in films and on television in such series as Smash and Mozart in the Jungle. She has been nominated for three Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards, winning once.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Jaojoby's musical style began with his {{childhood}} {{exposure to the}} Western-Malagasy syncretism of local church hymns, and the rhythm, harmonies, and form of the traditional antsa style of northern Madagascar. The antsa is a choral style common across northern Madagascar characterized by large group performance of minor polyharmonies over a highly syncopated multi-rhythmic hand-clap or other percussive accompaniment. Upon relocating to Diego-Suarez, Jaojoby was exposed to Western artists and musical genres, {{as well as the}} music of Freddy Ranarison, the first local artist to popularize the adaptation of traditional Malagasy styles to the electric guitar. Singing with Los Matadores provided Jaojoby with the opportunity to cover the hits of his idols, including Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, and James Brown. During his years performing with this band and his subsequent group, Les Players, Jaojoby adeptly covered hits from a vast range of regional and international genres ranging from <b>the</b> <b>jerk,</b> tango and, cha-cha-cha to the sega and slow romantic ballads. Together, these musical influences formed the basis of Jaojoby's style.|$|E

25|$|Beam engines {{were found}} to be less {{suitable}} than rotary steam engines, because of <b>the</b> <b>jerk</b> experienced when the piston changed direction, and in Cornwall only the Wheal Reeth man engine, Godolphin, (where a pumping engine was converted to this new use) was powered by a piston acting directly on the rods. When not in use for the man engine, it was an advantage that a rotary engine could also be used to power a whim.|$|E

[...] According to Legacy, only two tracks on the album are jerking songs. He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was quick to point out that most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'.

500|$|The Village Voices Sean Fennessey {{commented that}} the {{production}} by Bink! was gorgeous in nature.

And just three minutes long. But the album version is something bigger, with a magisterial guest verse from Rick Ross (appearing twice here) that comes after an odd but sumptuous acid-jazz breakdown." [...] Craig Jenkins [...] of Prefix Music opined that [...] "Bink’s beat for 'Devil in a New Dress' peters out midway through, and a live band plays a sultry, emotive take on that beat." [...] Andrew Barber of Complex stated that for the people disappointed in the briefness of the verses provided by Ross on [...] "Monster", this track more than makes up for it. Barber favorably compared the track to the style of West's older songs, and commented that it showcased West's [...] "softer, more vulnerable side, opening up about a woman." ...|$|E

Despite the laidback groove, West shows his vulnerable side, as he laments being loved and left." [...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] contains lyrics about lust and heartache, with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". Rap-Up called it a [...] "female-focused song" [...] and a [...] "soulful track, boasting a slow-rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample.” Alex Koening of Knightnews wrote [...] "over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue-in-cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed: 'I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat/ I ordered <b>the</b> <b>jerk,</b> she said {{you are what you}} eat.'

500|$|Like other bird's nest {{fungi in}} the Nidulariaceae, species of Cyathus have their spores {{dispersed}} when water {{falls into the}} fruit body. The fruit body is shaped so that the kinetic energy of a fallen raindrop is redirected upward and slightly outward by {{the angle of the}} cup wall, which is consistently 70–75° with the horizontal. The action ejects the peridioles out of the so-called [...] "splash cup", where it may break and spread the spores within, or be eaten and dispersed by animals after passing through the digestive tract. This method of spore dispersal in the Nidulariaceae was tested experimentally by George Willard Martin in 1924, and later elaborated by Arthur Henry Reginald Buller, who used Cyathus striatus as the model species to experimentally investigate the phenomenon. Buller's major conclusions about spore dispersal were later summarized by his graduate student Harold J. Brodie, with whom he conducted several of these splash cup experiments: Raindrops cause the peridioles of the Nidulariaceae to be thrown about four feet by splash action. In the genus Cyathus, as a peridiole is jerked out of its cup, the funiculus is torn and this makes possible the expansion of a mass of adhesive hyphae (the hapteron) which clings to any object in the line of flight. The momentum of the peridiole causes a long cord to be pulled out of a sheath attached to the peridiole. The peridiole is checked in flight and <b>the</b> <b>jerk</b> causes the funicular cord to become wound around stems or entangled among plant hairs. Thus the peridiole becomes attached to vegetation and may be eaten subsequently by herbivorous animals.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's <b>the</b> <b>jerk</b> that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E

40|$|Propriospinal Myoclonus (PSM) is {{characterized}} by <b>jerks</b> arising within <b>the</b> cord and propagating rostrally and caudally at low velocity, probably along propnospmal pathways intrinsic to the cord. In the last years we have encountered 5 males aged between 41 to 73 years displaying the clinical and polygraphic features of PSM PSM had set in all without any recognizable trigger, and neurological examination and MRI of cord and brain were normal in all except one patient who had an arachnoid cyst {{at the level of}} the T 9 left root. EMG showed that <b>the</b> <b>jerks</b> arose in spinally innervated muscles, usually the thoracic or lumbar segments; <b>the</b> <b>jerks</b> were thereafter propagated to rostral and caudal muscles at velocities of 3 to 16 m/s, according to a propriospinal pattern of propagation. Polygraphic studies showed that in 4 cases <b>the</b> <b>jerks</b> occurred quasirhythmically only during periods of relaxed wakefulness, when EEG alpha activity spread to anterior regions. Any mental activation and sleep inhibited the PSM. In the 5 th case, some features of the restless legs syndrome were found, and <b>the</b> <b>jerks</b> lasted into light sleep. PSM responded partially to clonazepam or tramadol. PSM is a peculiar movement disorder arising in the spinal cord but subjected to supraspinal influences during the various wake and sleep stages.
