50|$|The adult {{parasite}} infects {{the small}} intestine of fowl, {{from where it}} obtains nutrition from the digested food of the host. The tapeworm is responsible for stunted growth of young chicken, emaciation of adult and decreased egg production of hen. In general the tapeworm does not cause gross pathological damages on well-nourished chicken, but do compete for food when they grow to excessive number. In such situation, severe lesions on the intestinal walls and diarrhoea could arise, which ostensibly resulted in ill health. Under heavy infestation, R. echinobothrida is listed {{as one of the}} most pathogenic tapeworms, causing conspicuous intestinal nodules in chicken, with characteristic hyperplastic enteritis associated with the formation of granuloma. The symptom is termed “nodular tapeworm disease” in poultry. Intestinal nodules often result in degeneration and necrosis of intestinal villi, accompanied by anaemia with a significant increase of total leukocyte counts and decrease of <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein.</b> The nodules can measure up to 6 mm in diameter, which can be seen as rugged swellings on autopsy, and often cause catarrh and enteritis.|$|E

40|$|Objective-To compare 4 assay {{procedures}} for prediction of passive transfer status in lambs. Animals-Thirty-one 1 -day-old Sardinian lambs. Procedure-Serum IgG concentration {{was determined by}} use of single radial immunodiffusion, The following were determined: <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration as measured by refractometry (ie, refractometry <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration), <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration {{as determined by the}} biuret method (ie, biuret method <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration), <b>serum</b> gamma-globulin concentration as determined by <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> electrophoresis, and <b>serum</b> gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity as measured by spectrophotometry. Accuracy of these assays for estimation of serum IgG concentration in 1 -day-old lambs was established by use of linear regression analysis. Results-Refractometry <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration, biuret method <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration, and <b>serum</b> gamma-globulin concentration were closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG concentration. The natural logarithm (In) of serum GGT activity was closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG concentration (In) Refractometry <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration, biuret method <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration, and gamma-globulin concentration accounted for approximately 85 %, 91 %, and 95 % of the variation in serum IgG concentration, respectively.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-For prediction of passive transfer status in 1 -day-old lambs, serum GGT activity or biuret method <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> concentration determination will allow for passive transfer monitoring program development.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that major and melancholic depression are accompanied by a lower availability of total L-tryptophan (L-TRP) to the brain and by significant changes in electrophoretically separated protein fractions, such as albumin and α 2 -globulin. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between serum L-TRP availability and <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein,</b> albumin, and α 2 -globulin in 42 depressed and 24 normal subjects. In depressed and normal subjects, alone and together, there were significant and positive correlations between serum L-TRP and <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> or albumin concentrations. In the depressed subjects, but not in normal controls, there were significant inverse relationships between the L-TRP/competing amino acid ratio and the α 2 -globulin fraction. Serum L-TRP and albumin were significantly lower in melancholic subjects than in normal and minor depressed subjects. Depressed subjects had a significantly lower L-TRP/competing amino acid ratio and significantly higher serum α-globulin than normal controls. <b>Total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> was significantly lower in major depressed subjects than in normal controls. The results suggest that lower L-TRP availability to the brain in depression is related to lower serum albumin and to increased α 2 -globulin fraction, which are both hallmarks of the acute phase response in depression.

40|$|A {{relationship}} between size of infesting dose and multiple infestation and the <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> was demonstrated. During primary infestations with low and medium-sized doses of infective larvae, the <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> fell. After infestation with large larval doses or after multiple infestations the <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> increased. Hypoalbuminaemia could be demonstrated after both {{primary and secondary}} infestations; also the animals given secondary infestation had failed to regain the level of serum albumin present before primary infestation. Both α- and β 1 -globulins of sheep with either first or second infestation retained a level commensurate with, or decreased compared with, that in the control animals. These changes are discussed in relation to osmotic balance of the infected animal. The β 2 -globulins increased during both primary and secondary infestations: However, the increase was greatest during the primary infestation. Increases in the γ-globulin fraction also occurred but here the greatest increase occurred after secondary infestation. After primary infestation the γ-globulin levels first fell and then increased as the infestation progressed. There was a correlation between the complement fixation, but not the passive haemagglutination, antibody titres and the increased serum β 2 - and γ-globulin levels. However, the increased γ-globulin levels after secondary infestation were too great to be solely accounted for by an immunological response...|$|R

Fructosamine concentrations were lower than expected in the patients who were improving and higher than expected in the patient who was deteriorating. It is suggested that while fructosamine is not a direct substitute for HbA 1 c it may be a useful adjunct in determining whether a patient is worsening or improving in the short term.
