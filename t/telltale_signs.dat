500|$|The episode shows <b>telltale</b> <b>signs</b> {{of being}} one of the {{earliest}} produced. The characters act completely differently from later seasons: akin to her portrayal in the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa is an undisciplined brat indistinguishable from Bart, Marge gets drunk and is inattentive, and Homer is the voice of reason. These roles were reversed in later episodes. It was an early episode for Mr. Burns, who was voiced by Christopher Collins in the previous episode, [...] "Homer's Odyssey". Originally, the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan, a concept which was later dropped. The idea that he would greet his employees using index cards was inspired by the way Reagan would greet people. The episode marks the first time Burns refers to [...] "releasing the hounds".|$|E

It is argued that the facets of consciousness are describable by an object-oriented design with dynamically defined classes and objects. A comparison to economic theory is also made. We argue consciousness may also have redundant, protective mechanisms. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

Such personalities will often switch to other enjoyable activities the moment that they are deprived of enjoyment in their previous addiction.|$|R
