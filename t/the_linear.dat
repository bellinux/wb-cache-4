Their villages consisted of several, but sometimes up to a dozen or so rectangular communal long-houses, some over 30 meters long, supported by wooden posts, the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region. One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica, which is now at the west end of Kraków just within the city limits.|$|E

Interesting instances of two-dimensional intersymbol interference channels are magnetic storage, optical storage and Wyner's cellular network model. We {{show that the}} optimal maximum a posteriori detection in such channels lends itself to a natural linear programming based sub-optimal detector. We call this <b>the</b> Pairwise <b>linear</b> program detector. Our experiments show that <b>the</b> Pairwise <b>linear</b> program detector performs poorly. We then propose two methods to strengthen our detector. These detectors are based on systematically enhancing <b>the</b> Pairwise <b>linear</b> program. <b>The</b> first one, <b>the</b> Block <b>linear</b> program detector adds higher order potential functions in an exhaustive manner, as constraints, to <b>the</b> Pairwise <b>linear</b> program detector. We show by experiments that <b>the</b> Block <b>linear</b> program detector has performance close to the optimal detector. We then develop another detector by adaptively adding frustrated cycles to <b>the</b> Pairwise <b>linear</b> program detector. Empirically, this detector also has performance close to the optimal one and {{turns out to be}} less complex then <b>the</b> Block <b>linear</b> program detector.
