5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{original}} working titles of the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name is never spoken in the movie—it is, however, visible on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> dancers.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Cenotaph, {{opposite}} the Chester Road entrance to Gorse Hill Park, was {{built as a}} memorial to the 580 Stretford men {{who lost their lives}} in the First World War. Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> cenotaph. It was formally unveiled in 1923, by the Earl of Derby, Secretary of State for War.|$|E

5|$|The {{floor is}} of Jura marble, the altar, ambo, baptismal font and {{tabernacle}} {{are made of}} Lahn marble. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar held a neo-gothic crucifixion scene of Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene under the cross, from the Magdalenenkirche. Low stained glass windows forming the Stations of the Cross were designed by Paul Corazolla from Berlin. The first organ was built by E. F. Walcker & Cie. and consecrated in 1974. It {{was placed on the}} right side in the opening for the chapel, visible to the congregation. The free-standing bell tower, housing four bells, is 42m high.|$|E
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> band.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it {{should always be}} on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceiling of}} the church, which {{contains}} gold leafing, is from 1984, as are the crosses painted on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar {{and many of the}} light fixtures.|$|R
50|$|The George and Eugene Markle House is {{a two-story}} frame cross-gable Queen Anne house. A two-story shed roofed {{addition}} fills <b>the</b> angle between <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> front porch. The porch {{itself is a}} hip-roofed wraparound porch with Doric piers. The house is clad with clapboard, with the gables covered with decorative shingling.|$|R
50|$|Wiring and piping {{installed}} behind traditional plaster or wallboard ceilings {{is extremely}} difficult to modify once the finished ceiling is in place. Wires must either be fished through hollow spaces in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> finished ceiling, or the ceiling must be demolished in order for wiring or piping changes to be made.|$|R
5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives {{a page from the}} disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E

25|$|There are {{believed}} to have been settlements in the Chippenham region since before Roman times. Remains of Romano-British settlements are visible in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> former magistrates' court and recent redevelopments of the town have shown up other evidence of early settlements.|$|E
25|$|A {{statue of}} George Orwell, sculpted by the British {{sculptor}} Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, {{the headquarters of}} the BBC. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> statue is inscribed with: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} vestibule and ramp {{of the station}} are covered with granite tiles and have suspended ceilings. The entire station was designed in vibrant colors: the platforms are covered with colored granite tiles and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> have panels of circular red mosaic designs set on white tiles. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> panels are covered with a light blue mosaic.|$|R

60|$|On {{one side}} {{was a book}} stand, where a boy was selling books. There was a counter before, and shelves against <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind.</b> <b>The</b> shelves were filled with books. These books were in fancy-colored paper bindings, and seemed to consist chiefly of guide books and tales, and other similar works suited to the wants of travellers.|$|R
25|$|The DEGC {{awarded the}} {{demolition}} contract on April 22, 2008, with the speculation that demolition revenue {{would come from}} the sale of scrap metal and not from the City of Detroit. Wrecking crews commenced operations on June 30, in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> old bleacher section facing I-75 near the intersection of Trumbull Avenue. The demolition of the left field stands opened up the stadium's interior to view {{for the first time in}} decades on July 9, 2008 (the ballpark had been double-decked since the late 1930s).|$|E
25|$|The University Chapel was {{constructed}} {{as a memorial}} to the 755 sons of the University who {{had lost their lives}} in the First World War. Designed by Sir John Burnet, it was completed in 1929 and dedicated on 4 October. Tablets on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Communion Table list the names of those who died, while other tablets besides the stalls record the 405 members of the University community who gave their lives in the Second World War. Most of the windows are the work of Douglas Strachan, although some have been added over the years, including those on the South Wall, created by Alan Younger.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{is often}} {{separated from the}} body of the church by railings and screens, and, in the case of Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, by an iconostasis which forms a complete visual as well as physical barrier. The sanctuary is usually the most ornately decorated part of a church, creating a visual focus towards the altar. This might be done in several ways. There might be a carved or painted altarpiece, a large carved screen called a reredos, or a structure called a ciborium which form a canopy over the altar. In English churches that have a square eastern end, a very large stained glass window often fills <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar.|$|E
40|$|A choir, predominately women, {{is shown}} singing. They are wearing dark robes with sleeves that fold {{back to reveal}} a lining {{matching}} the stolls on the robes.

50|$|The {{upper level}} {{platforms}} {{are divided into}} a high and a low part. The high part is used by U79 trains which use high-floor light rail cars, the low part by trams of line 903 which are only equipped for low platforms. In <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> tracks, there are several mirrors which lead to {{the impression that the}} platform level is larger than it actually is.|$|R
25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
25|$|His work pleased {{the board}} and they {{assigned}} him to paint frescoes in the large lunettes of {{the walls of the}} chapel. Work began in 1500 and was completed in 1503. (There was a break in 1502 because funds were lacking.) These frescoes in the chapel are considered the most complex and impressive work by Signorelli. He and his school spent two years creating a series of frescoes concerning the Apocalypse and the Last Judgment, starting with the Preaching of the Antichrist, continuing with tumultuous episodes of the End of the World, finding a counterpart in the Resurrection of the Flesh. The fourth scene is a frightening depiction of the Damned taken to Hell and received by Demons. On <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar, Signorelli depicts on the left side the Elect being led to Paradise and on the right side the Reprobates driven to Hell. He added to these expressive scenes some striking details.|$|E
25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a man {{sitting at a}} table upon which is placed a mug of beer. The man, an American according to the title of the work, has his arms crossed and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E

50|$|A {{ball that}} is struck to hit <b>the</b> {{boundary}} <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bowler without touching {{the floor or}} {{any other part of}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> or roof part scores six runs. A ball that is struck to hit <b>the</b> boundary <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bowler and also touches the floor but does not touch any of <b>the</b> other <b>walls</b> or roof and hits <b>the</b> back boundary <b>wall</b> scores four runs. In some leagues these scores are switched around to discourage an over-emphasis on aerial shots.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} close to many museums {{including}} <b>the</b> Kunstareal. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> platforms are decorated with facsimiles of famous works of art. The station is named after the square above and opened on October 18, 1980. The floor {{is different from the}} other stations opened in that year, with gray-blue Azul granite slabs. The pillars are covered with large brown stone and the ceiling has two lighting bands veneered with aluminum fins.|$|R
