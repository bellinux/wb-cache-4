If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent <b>that</b> <b>anymore.</b> But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E
500|$|With {{the success}} of albums by Hill, Badu, and Maxwell, D'Angelo's second album Voodoo served as a further {{alternative}} to excesses of late 1990s R and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in 2000. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album [...] "the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles". By {{the time of her}} second album Mama's Gun (2000), Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as [...] "the queen of neo-soul". She said of the honorific title, [...] "I hated that because what if I don’t do <b>that</b> <b>anymore?</b> What if I change? Then that puts me in a penitentiary." [...] Subsequently, other artists attained success in the early 2000s, including Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor (2001). Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common, associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul, Phrenology (2002) and Electric Circus (2003).|$|E

2500|$|Comic Jumper was {{revealed}} on September 4, 2009 at PAX.

Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, {{there seemed to be}} a whole lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs seem to be doing <b>that</b> <b>anymore.</b> We're trying to bring that back a little bit with our games." [...] Comic Jumper is the brainchild of Josh Bear, co-founder and director at Twisted Pixel. [...] Wilford stated that Bear had the idea for the game beginning in seventh grade. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion.|$|E

Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do <b>that</b> <b>anymore,</b> you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E
