5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead,</b> , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
25|$|Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) was {{developed}} for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with unleaded. Rather than <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats {{so that they do}} not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel.|$|E
25|$|In the US it {{has been}} used in {{gasoline}} at low levels since 1979, replacing <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> as an antiknock (octane rating) additive to prevent engine knocking. Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion. Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, most refiners had chosen MTBE primarily for its blending characteristics and low cost.|$|E

An inhibitory effect of the concentration applied was noted on germination and growth of spores and gemmulae development. <b>Lead</b> <b>tetraethyl</b> produces disturbances In {{the development of these}} plants, gradual degeneration of chloroplasts occurs and inhibition of growth leading to profusely branched "dwarf" forms.

25|$|As a {{gasoline}} (petrol) additive, benzene increases the octane rating and reduces knocking. As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> replaced {{it as the}} most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as {{a gasoline}} additive in some nations. In the United States, concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the groundwater have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%. European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.|$|E
500|$|In a child's {{developing}} brain, lead {{interferes with}} synapse formation [...] in the cerebral cortex, neurochemical development (including that of neurotransmitters), {{and the organization}} of ion channels. Early childhood exposure has been linked with an increased risk of sleep disturbances and excessive daytime sleepiness in later childhood. High blood levels are associated with delayed puberty in girls. The rise and fall in exposure to airborne lead from the combustion of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> in gasoline during the 20th century has been linked with historical increases and decreases in crime levels, a hypothesis which is not universally accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Combustion {{consists}} of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The flammability {{of a given}} material strongly depends on the concentration of free radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to combustion of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out. [...] As indicated, [...] promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability. [...] For example, because lead itself deactivates free radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>lead</b> was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues (engine knocking) or premature ignition (preignition).|$|E

Unexpectedly, the theophylline-loaded hybrid gels release the drug not only below but also above the gel collapse temperature (GCT) with considerable rates and released amounts of drug. Surprisingly, evaluation of the sustained release profiles by the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation indicates that the release occurs by Fickian diffusion above GCT, which {{can be attributed to}} the lack of significant drug-polymer interaction at such temperatures. These results can be widely applied for the design and utilization of TMSPMA-based sol-gel polymer hybrids with desired release profiles of solutes below and above GCT for a variety of applications. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
