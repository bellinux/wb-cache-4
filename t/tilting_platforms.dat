Contender and Gladiators face {{off on a}} tug of war on two <b>tilting</b> <b>platforms.</b> Due to their weight {{advantage}} Gladiators are on a higher table that is initially tilted forward. Contenders have two 30 second pulls against the Gladiator, scoring 5 points each time they dislodge the Gladiator and 2 points for each draw. This event proved deeply unpopular with the Gladiators due to the disadvantage they were at on their tilt table and the event was quickly phased out of the series and training programmes in future series before being axed after the 1995 series.|$|E
50|$|An aerial {{tug of war}} {{in which}} both the {{challenger}} and the gladiator are on <b>tilting</b> <b>platforms.</b> The challenger {{is placed on the}} lower platform, which is tilted back, and the gladiator is placed on the higher platform tilted forwards. Because of their weight advantage, the gladiators had the harder job of having to tilt their table back in order to get any leverage on the rope. Two 30-second bouts are played. The challengers earn five points each time they pull the gladiator out of their platform, two for staying on for the 30 seconds. The event was axed after Series 2. Gladiators have stated that this game was very difficult for the Gladiator, and was heavily in favour of the contestant due to the height of the Gladiator's podium, and therefore gravity.|$|E

40|$|When {{introducing}} a new farm tractor in the market, manufacturers undergo a tight homologation path {{under the supervision}} of the OECD centres technicians. Two of the most requested tests, although not mandatory for the commercialization of a tractor, are the individuation of the centre-of-gravity and of the lateral rollover angle on a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform.</b> The results of these tests are very interesting for the technical characterization of a vehicle but still far from its real working conditions, even if the <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> test forecasts, for example, the presence of fuel in the tank and the use of some weights to simulate the driver. Indeed, in this last test, no mounted implement (or equivalent mass) is connected to the tractor, hence limiting a lot the use of the results of the described tests. Therefore, a numeric stability simulator was developed to overcome this problem, thus managing the variety of the possible implements to be connected to a tractor and giving the farmers effective indications concerning their vehicles’ safety while working on hillsides. This simulator, based on a Newtonian approach, is able to compute the stability of a vehicle formed by a tractor and an implement. It was used to verify the possibility of safety using some common mounted implements with a compact wheeled articulated tractor, specifically designed to work within terraced orchards/vineyards, common in mountain areas. This tractor was chosen because of its particular architecture: it gives the tractor a higher agility and a shorter turning radius than conventional tractors with the same dimensions, but also a very different stability behaviour, maybe not completely predictable in all situations by inexperienced drivers...|$|R
40|$|Context: Foot {{structure}} {{has been shown}} to effect aspects of neuromuscular control including postural stability and proprioception, however to our knowledge, no previous study has measured muscle reaction time to a simulated ankle sprain mechanism on participants with different foot structures. This is despite an association between pronated and supinated foot structures and the incidence of lateral ankle sprains. Objective: To determine whether pronated and supinated foot structures contribute to neuromuscular deficits as measured by muscle reaction time to a simulated ankle sprain mechanism. Design: Cross-Sectional Study Setting: University Biomechanics Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Thirty volunteers were categorised into three group???s dependant on navicular drop height measures. Ten participants had neutral feet (navicular drop height 5 - 9 mm), ten participants had pronated feet (navicular drop height ??? 10 mm), and ten participants had supinated feet (navicular drop height ??? 4 mm). Intervention(s) : Three perturbations on a standing <b>tilt</b> <b>platform</b> simulating the mechanics of an inversion and plantar flexion ankle sprain. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Muscle reaction time (ms) of the peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, and gluteus medius to the <b>tilt</b> <b>platform</b> perturbation. Results: Those with pronated and supinated foot structures had significantly slower peroneus longus reaction times than those with neutral feet (P =. 01 and P =. 04 respectively). No significant differences were found for the tibialis anterior or gluteus medius. Conclusions: Peroneus longus reaction time is influenced by foot structure. Further research is required to establish the consequences of slower peroneal reaction times in pronated and supinated foot structures. In future, researchers investigating lower limb muscle reaction time should control for foot structure as it may influence results...|$|R

40|$|An {{epidemiological}} study into {{the incidence of}} ankle sprain in elite and non-elite athletes was carried out {{to collect data on}} the incidence of sports injuries focusing specifically on ankle sprains in elite and non-elite athletes. Furthermore, to develop and validate a questionnaire to be used to collect data on the residual symptoms associated with a history of ankle sprain and functional instability. Ankle sprains accounted for 16 % of all injuries and symptoms of functional instability were reported by 95 % of athletes that reported sustaining an ankle sprain during the study. The questionnaire was then used to recruit subjects (19 subjects with a history of unilateral ankle sprain and functional instability and 19 healthy controls) for the subsequent experiments. Anteroposterior and medio-lateral postural sway in single-limb stance was examined using a KistierTM force platform. Each subject underwent twelve postural sway tests: three on each leg with eyes open and eyes closed. With eyes closed the injured ankle had significantly greater medial (p=O. 001) and lateral (p=O. 007) postural sway than the uninjured ankle. With eyes open the injured and uninjured ankles had similar postural control. With eyes open the injured ankle had significantly greater anterior (p=O. 021, p=O.

This ratio was used as an indication for the rearfoot position at the time of the induced supination stress impact, thus demonstrating the stress shielding influence of the tested ankle braces. In the same fashion we were able to indirectly document the kinematics of the rearfoot along with the muscle activity. The detailed interpretation of pressure sole data led not only to new evidence in the biomechanics of foot and ankle landing on tilted ground but proved to be useful in the profound evaluation of drop-jump testing. Furthermore we assessed information on ankle-foot kinematics in a close to reality supination stress impact with and without brace protection. The use of pressure soles in this context proved to be of great advantage. The statistically proven difference between the braces could be related back to the individual particulars of design. </BODY...|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} {{the realization of}} micro electro-mechanical systems for optical applications requiring very precise actuation. One of the requirements was {{the implementation of a}} vertical actuation mechanism based on comb actuators that allow accurate static displacements. Two devices have been realized following two different concepts for vertical comb drive actuators. One device provides a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> of 2 × 2 mm 2 which can be used to tune an optical element assembled on top of the platform. Two sets of vertically staggered comb actuators are used to create a vertical force which pulls down the platform to one or to the other side. We achieved a tilt angle of ± 3. 5 ° at 80 V in static operation. For demonstration purpose, we assembled a telecom resonant grating filter (RGF) onto the platform. We successfully scanned the entire telecom C-band (1530 - 1570 nm) by <b>tilting</b> the <b>platform</b> from - 3. 5 ° to + 3. 5 °. The other device provides a triangular mirror of 1. 7 mm edge length which is suspended by three C-shaped beams. Three sets of asymmetric vertical comb actuators are used for actuation. The mirror can perform either a pure vertical (piston) displacement of up to 18 µm at 80 V, or a tip-tilt of up to 2. 2 mrad at 50 V. The tip-tilt feature allows to correct a small wedge error with an optical component assembled on top of the device. Typical applications of such a device are tunable cavity systems where the required flatness of the mirror is of particular importance...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{increasing}} number of fatal coach accidents with tragic consequences for passengers showed the importance of passive safety in addition to the driver’s competence and active safety. In the European countries the certification of sufficient deformation strength when overturning is compulsory for the approval of a coach according to the ECE R 66 regulation. The certification is granted after positive results from crash tests or computer simulations with partial or full bus structure. The ECE R 66 regulation defines a survival space for the passengers which must remain intact after the accident. The tests specify either the overturning of the vehicle structure from a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> or the impact of a plate on the coach structure as it would correspond to the crash of the structure when falling onto the ground. Since such tests with real vehicle structures are costly and computer efficiency, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly better and cheaper, crash simulations will play a more important role for the approval in the future. This paper will present different LS-DYNA – time simulations of the overturning test with a segment of a bus structure according to ECE R 66 and time simulations with a pivoted plate hitting with the same kinetic energy against the structure as the model falling from the <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> and crashing onto the floor. Several modelling configurations with deformable and rigid undercarriage, with different friction coefficients of the contact ground-structure, are simulated. These calculations shall serve as a preparation for future calculations to obtain the necessary certification. Unfortunately no experimental results are available at present to enable the comparison between hardware test and computer simulation. However, the experience gained with tilting tests of similar coach structures in the past indicates the trustworthiness of the calculations. As these experiences are published on the panel of a users’ meeting, this paper goes more then usual into detail regarding the modelling and the difficulties in simulations which the authors, until that time unfamiliar with LS-DYNA, has to overcome.
