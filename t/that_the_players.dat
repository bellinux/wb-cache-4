5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh {{withdrew from}} playing Manchester on 11 March after tour manager James Scott refused to lend them money.

5|$|BioWare {{considered}} {{not making}} Tali a squadmate in Mass Effect 3. Some writers, such as Weekes, felt passionately about her inclusion, which {{led the team}} to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> could share his passion. Preston Watamaniuk, lead designer for the Mass Effect series, found Tali's death in 3 was the toughest for him to plan, though felt {{it needed to be}} possible due to the option of wiping out the quarians.|$|E

5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and had him sit in the players' area. It is claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made very much noise.|$|E
5|$|Events {{are put on}} for {{the benefit}} of the players, who take on roles called player {{characters}} (PCs) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> may create themselves or be given by the gamemasters. Players sometimes play the same character repeatedly at separate events, progressively developing the character and its relations with other characters and the setting.|$|E
5|$|Now, {{the match}} is {{recognised}} as the initial first-class match {{to be played}} in Australia. At the time, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> realised that the game {{was the first to}} take place between two Australian colonies, and was therefore a historic occasion. Although there were attempts in Australia to identify first-class matches, no formal definition was applied in Australia until 1947. A meeting of the International Cricket Conference in 1981 agreed that all intercolonial and interstate matches played in Australia before 1947, including the 1851 match, should retrospectively be considered first-class.|$|E

He tells <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to go to the shipping company to make the trip.|$|R
5|$|On this tour, Chappell {{clashed with}} cricket administrators over pay and {{conditions}} for the first time. The South African authorities requested that an extra Test {{be added to the}} fixture and the Australian Board of Control consented. Incensed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> were not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group of his teammates in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> earned only £85 per Test {{and that he}} was almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E

5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams {{made the trip}} by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Power of Four were {{circulated}} {{to all of}} the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods. The song was not released as a single however it was permitted to be broadcast by radio stations and it was made available to download on the Internet. The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they would know the words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> were under no obligation to sing it.|$|E

5|$|The parties {{settled the}} lawsuit on July 25, 2011, and a {{majority}} of players signed union authorization cards. The NFL officially recognized the NFLPA's status as the players' collective bargaining representative on July 30, 2011. The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. Under the agreement, which runs through 2021, revenue sharing, the most contentious issue during the lockout, was re-designed so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> must receive at least 47% of all revenue in salary for the term of the agreement. Additionally, a limit was placed on the amount of money given to rookies. Fifty million dollars was set aside annually for medical research and approximately $1 billion would be set aside for retired player benefits {{over the life of the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was going to put in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> would be looking at the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E
5|$|With two clubs from Edinburgh {{qualifying}} for the final, some City of Edinburgh Council members {{called for the}} match to be played at Murrayfield Stadium instead of Hampden Park, the traditional venue for Scottish Cup Finals. A survey by the Edinburgh Evening News found that 37 of 58 councillors favoured Murrayfield, with nine favouring Hampden. Supporters of moving the game to Murrayfield cited its greater capacity, convenience {{for the majority of}} fans and the precedent of the 1896 Scottish Cup Final. The Scottish Football Association stated that no venue other than Hampden would be considered. Supporters of keeping the game at Hampden cited <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> would prefer to play at the national football stadium and that some fans had already begun to make arrangements for the tie being in Glasgow. First ScotRail provided additional capacity on their routes between Edinburgh and Glasgow.|$|E

5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake {{if they are}} hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E
5|$|The regular Football League {{returned}} {{in time for}} the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and was a major contributor to 30 of the club's 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United {{on the final day of}} the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this was only because he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press.|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E
