40|$|The {{necessity}} {{to publish the}} second edition of this book arose when its third German edition had just been published. <b>This</b> <b>second</b> <b>English</b> <b>edition</b> is there­ fore a translation of the third German edition of Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis Testing in Linear Models, published in 1997. It differs from the first English edition {{by the addition of}} a new chapter on robust estimation of parameters and the deletion of the section on discriminant analysis, which has been more completely dealt with by the author in the book Bayesian In­ ference with Geodetic Applications, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg New York, 1990. Smaller additions and deletions have been incorporated, to im­ prove the text, to point out new developments or to eliminate errors which became apparent. A few examples have been also added. I thank Springer-Verlag for publishing this second edition and for the assistance in checking the translation, although the responsibility of errors remains with the author. I also want to express my thanks to Mrs. Ingrid Wahl and to Mrs. Heidemarlen Westhiiuser who prepared the second edition.

40|$|<b>This</b> is the <b>second</b> <b>English</b> <b>edition</b> of {{what has}} become one of the {{definitive}} works on superconductivity in German [...] currently in its sixth edition. Comprehensive and easy to understand, this introductory text is written especially with the non-specialist in mind. The authors, both long-term experts in this field, present the fundamental considerations without the need for extensive mathematics, describing the various phenomena connected with the superconducting state, with liberal insertion of experimental facts and examples for modern applications. While all fields of superconducting phenomena are dealt with in detail, this new edition pays particular attention to the groundbreaking discovery of magnesium diboride and the current developments in this field. In addition, a new chapter provides an overview of the elements, alloys and compounds where superconductivity has been observed in experiments, together with their major characteristics. The chapter on technical applications has been considerably expanded to accommodate microelectronics, while the key aspects of criticalcurrents as well as Josephson junctions now each have their own chapte...|$|R
