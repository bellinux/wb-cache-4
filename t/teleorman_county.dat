He presided over an architectural jury which favored the project by Alexandre Marcel, despite accusations of plagiarism. In July 1894, alongside Manu, Sturdza, Triandafil, and Constantin C. Arion, he founded the Agricultural Bank. His business activities were focused on Buftea, where he inaugurated a canning plant, twenty orchards, one hundred gardens, and fifty vineyards. By 1898, his property there totaled 2350 hectares (5806 acres), {{more than half of}} Buftea's territory. He also spent summers in Dărmănești, where he was neighbors and friends with a fellow Conservative, Radu Rosetti.

2500|$|Theodorescu {{argues that}} Năsturel's {{contribution}} as a palace commissioner is enduring, being a direct precursor of {{experiments in the}} 18th-century Brâncovenesc style. His literary adaptation, the blason, remained a standard and forme fixe in Romanian poetry into the 19th century, even after Slavonic had been dropped. As noted by Negrici, this pattern was exceedingly conservative, characterized by [...] "stereotypes and repetition". The Năsturel family, which continued {{to be associated with}} Udricani and Dobroteasa down to the 1840s, also used Udriște's coat of arms, although it was tolerated, rather than validated, by the succession of Wallachian Princes. In 1831, it transferred Herăști to Miloš Obrenović, whose Serbian princely family later sold the domain to a Romanian politician, Anastase Stolojan. The Năsturels developed another property, Năsturelu in <b>Teleorman</b> <b>County,</b> which housed a model farm and lands providing for the upkeep of Sfânta Vineri Herasca.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA major {{direction}} of the educational reforms {{made in the last}} 20 years in Romania - same as in other countries from the European Union - was the restructuration of the initial and continuous training of the didactic personnel. In this respect, nowadays, the teacher must see and act beyond the horizons of the taught discipline, in order to form pupils’ competences which are necessary for life as a whole. Reported to the multiplication of the roles confined to those who embrace a didactic career, a corresponding psycho-pedagogical and methodical reformation must be made. This implies a demarche of redefining the necessary competences for the exertion of the didactic profession and an identification of new curricula resources, which are {{to be used as a}} support, in order to obtain those competences. At the same time, all those changes made in the field of initial and continuous training must be regarded in the context of unitary learning strategies, along the entire life. This paper proposes an analysis concerning the way in which the continuous professional development programmes are held in Romania, especially those dedicated to Science teachers (Chemistry, Physics and Biology). At the same time, in this context, it is presented the innovative aspect supposed by the CPD programme “PROFILES - Education through Sciences”, where the target group has been constituted of Science teachers from secondary schools of Dâmboviţa, Buzău and <b>Teleorman</b> <b>Counties...</b>|$|R
