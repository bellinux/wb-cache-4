25|$|Honda {{implemented}} the eight-speed DCT in the Acura ILX and TLX. It {{is also the}} only company to pair their DCT with a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> to smooth low-speed crawling (a problem found in many traditional DCTs). The Acura NSX super car also uses a nine-speed DCT, which consists of launch gear and a cruising gear while seven gears in the middle are geared closer to each other. The Sport Hybrid versions of the Acura RLX and MDX models both have a 7-speed DCT. Neither the 7 nor 9-speed DCTs contain a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> as the electric motors of the hybrid system already alleviate the rough slow start issue.|$|E

25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a <b>torque</b> <b>converter.</b> A <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> {{consists of}} three main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E

One vehicle was {{converted}} {{from the original}} T24 prototype and tested in October 1944. The vehicle had superior performance compared to the M24, but suffered from transmission reliability problems.|$|E
25|$|In simple terms, a DSG is two {{separate}} manual gearboxes (and clutches) contained within one housing and working as one unit. It {{was designed by}} BorgWarner and is licensed to the Volkswagen Group, with support by IAV GmbH. By using two independent clutches, a DSG can achieve faster shift times and eliminates the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> of a conventional epicyclic automatic transmission.|$|E

5000|$|A Borg-Warner 3-speed {{automatic}} {{was tested}} and was installed on car #1048, but Tucker ultimately wanted to design his own transmission for the car.To solve the transmission {{problems with a}} new design, Warren Rice, creator of the Buick Dynaflow transmission, was consulted. A unique continuously variable transmission called the [...] "Tuckermatic" [...] was designed, which {{was strong enough to}} handle the Franklin O-335's power and torque. It was a simple but effective design with double <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> and only 27 parts, about 90 fewer than normally required for an automatic. The double <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> allowed a continuously variable drive ratio with only one forward gear and one reverse gear which used the <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> to vary the transmission ratio based on load and engine speed.|$|R
50|$|The six-cylinder engines usually {{drove through}} {{standard}} mechanical transmissions, but the eight-cylinder engines were usually coupled to Twin-disc (Rolls-Royce) <b>torque</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|R
25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have}} to be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the clutch lever. This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
25|$|Also {{introduced}} {{this year was}} a new 425 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 with horsepower ratings ranging from 300 to 370 depending on carburation and compression ratio. The new three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission with <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> replaced the Roto HydraMatic used since 1961. Also new to the option list for 1965 on all B-body cars was a four-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter, which was a seldom-ordered offering.|$|E
25|$|American Motors {{introduced}} the open differential Model 128 transfer {{case for the}} Eagle. The automatic transmission {{no longer had a}} lockup <b>torque</b> <b>converter.</b> Eagle sales would drop beneath the 10,000 annual unit mark for the first time for 1986 (and would slide further for its remaining two seasons on the market), as the car was aging due to its seven-season life atop a platform that debuted for 1970.|$|E

25|$|The Oshkosh 1070F {{shares a}} common chassis and axle set-up with the M1070A0 model, but {{the cab and}} all major {{driveline}} components have been substantially revised to meet both performance and legislative requirements. The driveline {{is similar to that}} fitted to the M1070A1 and consists of a Caterpillar C-18 diesel engine developing 700 hp, this coupled to an Allison HD 4076P automatic transmission and TC-561 <b>torque</b> <b>converter,</b> coupled to an Oshkosh 30000 single-speed transfer case.|$|E
25|$|The 86, BRZ and FR-S {{are offered}} with two 6-speed transmissions, an {{in-house}} developed Toyota TL70 manual gearbox (based on Aisin AI's AZ6) and an Aisin-Warner A960E automatic transmission, which is modified from that {{used on the}} Lexus IS 250. The latter uses a traditional wet <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> design, but its software has been engineered to mimic the response of a dual-clutch gearbox. The automatic transmission uses three different modes: Sport, Snow, and Normal. A torque sensing limited slip differential is standard on most models.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX's new {{transmission}} can lock-up its <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> from 2nd through 6th gears to improve fuel economy. By dropping the center locking differential, a new Active Torque Control all-wheel drive system diverts anywhere from 50% {{or up to}} 100% power to the front wheels for reduced drivetrain associated efficiency losses which in turn increases fuel efficiency. An Electric Power Steering (EPS) system replaces the previous belt-driven hydraulic pump. A double wishbone rear suspension setup replaces the previous MacPherson strut design for improved handling and greater cargo space, while an optional Sports Package adds a performance-tuned suspension.|$|E
25|$|Diesel–hydraulic {{locomotives}} use {{one or more}} <b>torque</b> <b>converters,</b> {{in combination}} with gears, with a mechanical final drive to convey the power from the diesel engine to the wheels.|$|R

25|$|The {{big-block}} 455 {{was gone}} forever. The base engine {{was now the}} Buick 350 with a 4-barrel carburetor until 1979. The Oldsmobile 403 was optional from 1977 to 1979. Oldsmobile's 350 diesel {{was added to the}} option list beginning in 1980, along with an Oldsmobile-sourced 307. The Buick 350 was now optional, with the base engine being the Buick 4.1 L V6 for improved fuel economy. In 1981, the then-optional Buick 350 was dropped. That same year, the Electra gained the new THM200-4R automatic transmission, which featured a lock-up <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Electra could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range.|$|E
25|$|Replacing the old Dynaflow-based {{two-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available {{with the standard}} two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine {{as well as the}} 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed manual was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.|$|E
50|$|The fluid {{coupling}} originates {{from the work}} of Hermann Föttinger, who was the chief designer at the AG Vulcan Works in Stettin. His patents from 1905 covered both {{fluid coupling}}s and <b>torque</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|R

50|$|Twin Disc <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> (formerly {{made under}} licence in the United Kingdom by Rolls-Royce) were fitted to the British Rail Class 125 diesel {{multiple}} units and some export diesel locomotives, e.g. NZR TR class.|$|R
25|$|In 1948 {{a series}} script {{appeared}} on the front fenders and the white Tenelite steering wheel {{that had been used}} previously was traded in for a black one, in order match the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver tone instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered, consisting of cloth upholstery with leather bolsters with the robe cord cover and lower door panels trimmed in leatherette. Convertibles acquired power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. But the biggest advancement was the introduction of Dynaflow, the first passenger car <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year, it was so popular that by the following it was standard equipment. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year.|$|E
25|$|Only minor grille and {{taillight}} lens revisions {{highlighted the}} 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was {{dropped from the}} option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new Computer Command Control engine management system. This system was the forerunner, and surprisingly similar to today's OBDII which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine RPM's, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R transmission, which added an overdrive gear and <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity. The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered {{for the last time}} this year.|$|E
25|$|Mild hybrid, is {{a vehicle}} that cannot be driven solely on its {{electric}} motor, because the electric motor {{does not have enough}} power to propel the vehicle on its own. Mild hybrids only include some of the features found in hybrid technology, and usually achieve limited fuel consumption savings, up to 15 percent in urban driving and 8 to 10 percent overall cycle. A mild hybrid is essentially a conventional vehicle with oversize starter motor, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the car is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly and cleanly. The motor is often mounted between the engine and transmission, taking the place of the <b>torque</b> <b>converter,</b> and is used to supply additional propulsion energy when accelerating. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the gasoline engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, the motor is used for regenerative braking to recapture energy. As compared to full hybrids, mild hybrids have smaller batteries and a smaller, weaker motor/generator, which allows manufacturers to reduce cost and weight.|$|E
50|$|They can be finely {{controlled}} and provide high torque from rest, unlike internal combustion engines, {{and do not}} need multiple gears to match power curves. This removes the need for gearboxes and <b>torque</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some of the 096 {{parts were}} held {{over for the}} 01M transmission, such as oil filter, oil pan, filler tube, gaskets, {{speedometer}} gears, skid plate, etc. These transmissions have different <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> and other internal parts that are not interchangeable.|$|R
50|$|Fluid {{couplings}} {{are found}} in some Diesel locomotives {{as part of the}} power transmission system. Self-Changing Gears made semi-automatic transmissions for British Rail, and Voith manufacture turbo-transmissions for railcars and diesel multiple units which contain various combinations of fluid couplings and <b>torque</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|R
