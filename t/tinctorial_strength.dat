30|$|Having said so, natural dyes do {{have some}} {{inherent}} limitations such as poor <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength,</b> lack of reproducibility, inferior fastness properties and un-exhausted metallic mordants in the residual dye bath posing serious challenges to the environment [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Chemical modification of the natural dyes can overcome some of these inherent challenges to make them preferred choice under prevailing scenario.|$|E
30|$|Di- and triarylcarbonium dyes {{and their}} heterocyclic {{derivatives}} comprise the oldest class of synthetic dyes—the majority {{of which were}} discovered in the 19 th and early 20 th century. Diphenylmethane and Triphenylmethane dyes {{are the most important}} aryl carbonium dyes. Structurally and property wise they are similar to the cyanine dyes i.e. exceptional brightness, high <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> and low light fastness.|$|E
30|$|Anthraquinone dyes are {{the second}} most {{important}} class after azo dyes. They are also one of the oldest types of dyes since they have been found in the covering of mummies dating back over 4000  years. In contrast to the azo dyes, which have no natural counterparts, all the natural red dyes were anthraquinones. The lower <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> and reduced flexibility increase the production cost of anthraquinone dyes and hence, they are not as widely used as azo dyes.|$|E
30|$|The {{main object}} of this {{research}} is to provide aluminum pigment colored to the highest chroma by depositing phthalocyanine green G pigment on the surface of aluminum pigment, thereby improving the chroma and avoiding the issue of color fading and exfoliation inherent in conventionally pigment colored aluminum pigments. To achieve these objectives, a colorful pigment (phthalocyanine green G) with inherently high <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> and excellent fastness to different solvents, heat, light, weathering [15, 25] was chosen and adsorbed onto aluminum pigment having adsorption layer of inorganic acid radical with the green colorful pigment adhered to said adsorption layer. The phthalocyanine green G colored aluminum pigment was then coated with a polymer using radical polymerization, and its properties were investigated. The application of both techniques overcome the limitations of classical polymerization and corrosion inhibition methods and provides an efficient route for preparing colored aluminum pigment having excellent properties.|$|E
30|$|Chemical {{modification}} of natural dye; Areca Nut was done successfully using the diazo-coupling reaction of areca nut extract to get semi-synthetic dyes with appreciable yield for in tune for commercial exploitation. The physical {{properties of the}} azo compounds (modified dyes) such as melting points, Rf values, UV–Visible and FTIR spectroscopic results show that, obtained modified dyes are fairly pure compounds acceptable for dyeing of textiles. All the three modified dyes were successfully applied on polyester and nylon fabrics with appreciable depth and shades with excellent overall fastness properties. The dyeing in addition to performance properties also found to give very good ultra violet protection factor. Thus, {{it can be said}} that chemical {{modification of}} natural dye can be used to overcome the inherent limitations of natural dyes such as poor <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength,</b> lack of reproducibility due to varying purity and inferior fastness properties for the bulk scale application in absence of mordants.|$|E
40|$|Perylenediimide (PDI) {{molecules}} {{are promising}} {{building blocks for}} photophysical studies of electronic interactions within multichromophore arrays. Such PDI arrays are important materials for fabrication of molecular nanodevices such as organic light-emitting diodes, organic semiconductors, and biosensors because of their high photostability, chemical and physical inertness, electron affinity, and high <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> over the entire visible spectrum. In this work, PDIs have been organized into linear (L 3) and trefoil (T 3) trimer molecules and investigated by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to probe the relationship between molecular structures and interchromophoric electronic interactions. We found a broad distribution of coupling strengths in both L 3 and T 3 and hence strong/weak coupling between PDI units by monitoring spectral peak shifts in single-molecule fluorescence spectra upon sequential photobleaching of each constituent chromophore. In addition, we used a wide-field defocused imaging technique to resolve heterogeneities in molecular structures of L 3 and T 3 embedded in a PMMA polymer matrix. A systematic comparison between {{the two sets of}} experimental results allowed us to infer the correlation between intermolecular interactions and molecular structures. Our results show control of the PDI intermolecular interactions using suitable multichromophoric structures. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|As is well known, azo {{pigments}} {{are widely}} used in imaging and printing industries because of their versatile colors, high <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> {{as well as their}} low price. 1 Nagata et al. have recently reported on the synthesis of some novel azo pigments, 2 which include 2, 6 -bis[5 -amino- 3 -tert-butyl- 4 -(3 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -thiadizol- 5 -yldiazeneyl) - 1 H-pyrazol- 1 -yl]- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 4 (1 H) -one, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) {i. e. B-PAT: the cis configuration of the title compound [Fig. 1 (b) ]}. Our pigmentary characterization of B-PAT revealed that it exhibits good performance in light and heat-stability, but rather poor in solvent-fastness. In this connection, an attempt was made in our investigation to improve its performance from structural point of view. During crystal growth, we unexpectedly isolated two kinds of five-coordinate bisazo Na-complexes 3, 4 [Na-containing B-PAT of the cis form: Fig. S 1 (a) ] as well as one Na-free monoazo compound 5 [M-PAT: Fig. S 1 (b) ] (Supporting Information I: This is available free of charge on the Web a...|$|E
40|$|Unmodified {{polyester}} fibres {{can only}} be dyed with disperse dyestuffs either with theaid of carriers at 100 oC (no longer desirable due to environmental limitations), orat elevated temperatures (130 oC for the exhaustion processes and 210 oC for the thermosol processes). The economical production of wash-fast, light-fast and sublima-tion-fast, red and bluish-red dyeings on polyester fibres with azo disperse dyestuffs is not easily achievable. The aim {{of the present study}} was to synthesize new dyestuffs based on various 4 -aminonaphthalimide derivatives in order to achieve the above mentioned goals. The use of various 4 -aminonaphthalimide derivatives as diazo components and β-naphthol as the coupling component gave a series of bright red dyeings on polyester fibres. The use of N,N-diethyl-m-toluidine as a coupling component together with the same diazo components gave bright bluish-red dyeings on polyester fibres. Using N-propyl- 4 -aminonaphthalimide as an azo component and p-amino acetophenone as a coupling component gave a yellowish-cream dyed polyester fibres. Spectrophotometric studies on polyester fibres, showed that the attained dyeings had good <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> and high colour build up on polyester fibres. The dyeings also gave perfect wash fast-nesses, very good to excellent sublimation fastnesses and very good light fasstnesses...|$|E
40|$|Adsorpce barviv na povrchu přírodních a syntetických polymerních vláken nebo tkaných textilií je způsobena účinkem mezimolekulových sil mezi povrchem vlákna a barvivem. Tyto síly jsou poměrně silné. V tomto příspěvku je popsán vliv nízkoteplotní plazmy na povrch polyesteru pro jeho následné barvení. Adsorption of the dyes on {{the surface}} of the natural and {{synthetic}} polymer fibers, or weaved fabrics is created due to the effect of the intermolecular forces between fiber surface and the dye. Such forces are causing relatively strong bonding interaction between dye dipoles and the stained matrix. In the case of polymer and biopolymer materials the number of the dipoles is directly proportional to the number of polar groups in macromolecular side chains. The latter number of present dipoles is possible to be increased by several physico-chemical methods, e. g. fire treatment, chemical etching by strong acids, UV irradiation, corona discharge or low-temperature plasma treatments etc. In this communication the effect of low-temperature plasma treatment of polyester (PES) weaved fabric on dye adsorption to the surface of the studied substrate is discussed. Obtained increased dye selectivity to the stained matrix results in improved <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength,</b> better economical effectiveness as well as to the improved ecology of the process...|$|E
40|$|Certain leuco dyestuffs {{are known}} to exhibit a {{brilliant}} color by reaction with a phenolic developer; 2 -[(4 -hydroxyphenyl) sulfonyl]-phenol (BPS) is a well-known developer for black leuco dyes such as 6 -(diethylamino) - 3 -methyl- 2 -(phenylamino) - spiro[isobenzofuran- 1 (3 H), 9 -[9 H]-xanhen]- 3 -one (ODB) in thermosensitive papers. Although BPS is a small molecule (molecular weight: about 250), it is thermally stable as characterized by a high melting point of about 184 °C. Furthermore, the stability of BPS is also extended to the 1 : 1 “leuco/developer” system. In this connection, structure analysis of BPS {{has been carried out}} in order to elucidate the stability of BPS itself as well as its leuco/developer system. Then, we found that one BPS molecule is hydrogen bonded to four different neighboring ones, forming an OH¯O two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network. This ensures a high thermal stability of BPS. On the other hand, in the ODB/BPS system, only one of the four hydrogen bonds in BPS is used for the formation of the 1 : 1 ODB/BPS colorant while the remaining three hydrogen bonds keep the network. As for the <b>tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> in spin-coated ODB/BPS, the color intensity is found to be limited to about 70 % of the maximum available value. This is because there is a fraction of ODB molecules, whose lactone ring is still closed owing to the steric hindrance...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Several studies were conducted to assess the potential use of colored-flesh potato cultivars as a novel source of anthocyanins and phenolics. The accumulation of anthocyanins and phenolics during tuber development was dependent on several factors at a given planting location. Anthocyanins and phenolics were found in different concentrations in the potatoes and were distributed throughout the tuber. Peel samples had higher content than flesh. Environmental conditions seemed to affect more anthocyanin biosynthesis than that of phenolics. A decrease in phytochemical content was observed during tuber development due to increased tuber weight. This increase resulted in increased phytochemical yield when potatoes were harvested at late maturity stages. The low glycoalkaloid content of potatoes at this maturity stage did not present a toxicological concern for consumption. The use of post-harvest stresses shows a promising tool to trigger responses involved in the biosynthesis of specific anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, thus enhancing the commercial or nutritional value of food crops by inducing the accumulation of phytochemicals with added functional properties. In the case of colored potatoes, only wounding stress induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds and an increase in antioxidant activity. The color attributes and stability of aqueous anthocyanin extracts from potatoes were affected by pH, light and temperature, showing their highest stability at low pH, in dark conditions and at low temperatures. <b>Tinctorial</b> <b>strength</b> also influenced the color attributes of the extracts. Anthocyanin type had the greatest influence in the color retention and stability. Red potato extracts showed higher stability than purple potato extracts. Thermal anthocyanin degradation parameters of anthocyanin extracts at pH 3 were calculated. The hue from red potato extracts was similar to those from FD&C Red # 40, whereas purple potato extracts had similar hues to those from red cabbage extracts. These studies provide important information for potato breeders and the food industry by assessing the use of colored potatoes as a novel source of anthocyanins or phenolics. These potatoes offer a novel product with added functional properties...|$|E
