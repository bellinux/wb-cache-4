5|$|Apart from <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> {{noble titles}} or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices {{did not involve}} primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property.

Daughters received {{a portion of the}} family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.|$|E

5|$|As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also {{growth in the}} Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824–26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical front with tall tower.|$|E

5|$|George's {{distrust}} of the Tories aided <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> <b>of</b> power to the Whigs. Whig dominance would grow to be so great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E
