60|$|The {{girl would}} have been {{striking}} in any company. Neale thought her neither beautiful nor pretty, but he kept on looking. Her arms were bare, her dress cut very low. Her face offered vivid contrast to the carmine on her lips. It was a round, soft face, with narrow eyes, dark, seductive, bold. She <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{to one side and}} suddenly smiled at Neale. It startled him. It was a smile with the shock of a bullet. It held Neale, so that when she crossed to him he could not move. He felt rather than saw Hough return to his side. The girl took hold of the lapels of Neale's coat. She looked up. Her eyes were dark, with what seemed red shadows deep in them. She had white teeth. The carmined lips curled in a smile--a smile, impossible to believe, of youth and sweetness, that disclosed a dimple in her cheek. She was pretty. She was holding him, pulling him a little toward her.|$|E

50|$|Navadurga is the Kuldevta (family deity) of many Gaud Saraswat Brahmins (GSB's) and Daivadnya Brahmins in India - in Goa & Maharashtra. Due to the {{forceful}} Portuguese {{conversion and}} intervention into their rituals, the Deity {{with all the}} other purushas had to be shifted from Gavasim to their present respective places. The Saraswats and Daivadnyas who left to the north of Goa, established a temple in the honours of the Goddess. The present temple along with the kulpurushas is located in Vengulara Redi(Maharashtra). The other Saraswats and Daivadnyas who left to the East of Goa along with their Kulapurushas established a temple dedicated to the Goddess. Today the magnificent temple located in Madkai, is famous for its Navadurga having a tilted head. Legend says that a wealthy Saraswat merchant when placed a flower worth Rs. 1000, the Goddess <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> acknowledging the merchant's devotion. A similar legend follows at the Katyayani Baneshwar, a Konkani temple (once located in Benaulim, Goa) now located in Aversa, Karnataka. Here Katyayani too like the Navadurga has a tilted head.As the legend goes a goldsmith belonging to Daivadnya Brahmin community living in the village of Madkai was ordered by temple authorities to fabricate a mask of the Goddess Navdurga. The Goddess appeared in the goldsmith’s dream and told him to make the mask similar to his daughter’s face. The mask was prepared resembling his daughter’s face, but after few days his daughter became weak and died. The goldsmith was very sad because of her death. The Goddess appeared before him once again and told him that she will visit his house once in a year as his daughter. Hence as a tradition goes the same mask of the Goddess is welcomed in the Goldsmith’s house on Karthik Shukla Asthami day every year. This day is celebrated by the Madkaikars(Goldsmith's family) {{in the same way as}} a married girl visiting her paternal home. The Navdurgas located in Madkai (Goa), Kundaim (Goa) and Redi (Vengurla - Maharashtra) are considered to be Saraswat Kuldevtas whereas the others are gram devtas or normal Hindu temples.The present temple has recently banned entry of foreigners into the temple citing objectionable dressing and conduct as the reason.|$|E

Arno Nadel (1878 — 1943), born Vilna, Lithuania, a composer, arranger, conductor, writer, poet and painter; he also dedicated himself to the collection of both Eastern European folk songs and old manuscripts of Jewish liturgical music, and in 1916 he was appointed as Kapellmeister of the Berlin Jewish community.

She tells the detectives to stand down and briefs them on her investigation. After SVU goes forward with their prostitution investigation, Eames blames SVU for making her lose her target. When Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) realizes {{that one of the}} alleged working girls was connected to the terrorism plot, Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek) calls Eames in and Benson pleads with her to let them work the raid with her. Eames agrees, and they foil the terrorism plot. At the end of the episode, Benson asks Eames why she <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> at suspects while interrogating them, and Eames responds that it was something her former partner (presumably Goren) taught her.

Eames returns to help SVU track down a sniper who injured Detective Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) in the episode [...] "Poisoned Motive".|$|R
50|$|Some {{viewers of}} 3D movies {{complain}} of headaches or nausea {{during or after}} viewing. These problems {{can be caused by}} the viewer <b>tilting</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> making it harder for the brain to fuse the two images (due to parallax mismatch between the eyes and the cameras). It can also be caused by rapid transitions in the movie between scenes of very different depth. Consequently, directors and editors of 3D movies should avoid such transitions.|$|R
2500|$|The album's artwork {{was shot}} by Mert and Marcus and {{directed}} by Giovanni Bianco. The deluxe edition was unveiled through Madonna's official Facebook page on January 31, 2012. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the image as [...] "glamorous, deconstructed photograph" [...] where Madonna [...] "cocks <b>her</b> <b>head</b> up, <b>her</b> curly hair pulled back. She's wearing lots of mascara, bright red lipstick, a choker and a silky bright pink top. The photo {{has some kind of}} broken mirror filter over it, giving it a funky, dance-queen vibe." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the [...] "multi-hued" [...] artwork to the one of True Blue (1986), with the similarity in Madonna's blond locks and the <b>tilting</b> of <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> He further added that the artwork symbolized the different angles through which the singer has been scrutinized throughout her career. The standard edition cover was revealed on February 6, 2012. Its art direction included the same color palette and the distorted appearance like the deluxe version image, but featured a body-shot of Madonna in a red dress and gloves with jewelry.|$|R
50|$|To {{present a}} {{stereoscopic}} motion picture, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through circular polarizing filters of opposite handedness. The viewer wears eyeglasses which contain {{a pair of}} analyzing filters (circular polarizers mounted in reverse) of opposite handedness. Light that is left-circularly polarized is blocked by the right-handed analyzer, while right-circularly polarized light is extinguished by the left-handed analyzer. The result {{is similar to that}} of steroscopic viewing using linearly polarized glasses, except the viewer can <b>tilt</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and still maintain left/right separation (although stereoscopic image fusion will be lost due to the mismatch between the eye plane and the original camera plane).|$|R
60|$|Now {{that the}} queen was {{at ease in}} her mind once more, and measurably happy, her wine {{naturally}} began to assert itself again, and it got a little the start of her. I mean it set her music going--her silver bell of a tongue. Dear me, she was a master talker. It would not become me {{to suggest that it}} was pretty late and that I was a tired man and very sleepy. I wished I had gone off to bed when I had the chance. Now I must stick it out; there was no other way. So she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek --with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl. The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; she <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> graceful <b>head</b> as a bird does when it listens. The sound bored its way up through the stillness again.|$|R
5000|$|In most of {{the other}} portraits Hortense Fiquet is {{presented}} in more formal attire that perhaps reflects the importance she ascribed to fashion; it is said that an appointment with a dressmaker caused her to be late to her husband's deathbed in 1906. Fiquet and Cézanne married on 28 April 1886, though by that time he had said that he no longer had any feelings for Hortense, whom one scholar has described as [...] "a high-maintenance woman". Although he continued to paint his wife until the 1890s, he disinherited her; their only child, Paul (1872—1947) inherited the estate. The settlement that Hortense received from her son was squandered through gambling. After the death of Louis-Auguste Cézanne that same year, Cézanne and his wife separated, and he moved in with his sister and mother, remarking, [...] "My wife only cares for Switzerland and lemonade". The psychological distance between husband and wife appears to be reflected in the portraits where she gives the impression of self-absorption. The <b>tilt</b> of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and body in this work, along with the look of submission and the downward-shaped mouth, are all indicative of an inward, self-concerned nature.|$|R
