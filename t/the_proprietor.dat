500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after {{the establishment of the}} new system, conflict arose. The American Revolutionary War drove potential settlers away from Prince Edward Island. This caused two problems - firstly, it made it difficult for proprietors to fulfill an obligation attached to their grants, to settle one person per [...] within ten years of the system's commencement, and secondly, it meant that <b>the</b> <b>proprietors</b> were not being paid much rent, as there were not many tenants to pay it. This meant that <b>the</b> <b>proprietors</b> were unable, or at least not willing, to pay the required quitrent to the Crown. Conflict also arose between the tenants and <b>the</b> <b>proprietors.</b> As <b>the</b> lottery for Prince Edward Island land was held in London, and most of <b>the</b> <b>proprietors</b> were important figures from the United Kingdom, most of <b>the</b> <b>proprietors</b> did not actually live in British North America. This meant that many neglected their obligations to the settlers.|$|R
