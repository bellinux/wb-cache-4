50|$|The North Ipswich Railway Workshops {{illustrate}} the distinctive planning geometry which formed {{the model for}} late 19th century railway designers and engineers {{in many parts of}} the world. The fundamental concept was of parallel rail tracks leading into rows of fairly equally-spaced workshop buildings which in some cases intersected a <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution</b> axis known as a traverser. Construction of new buildings has continued into the 1980s and the site demonstrates the evolution from architecturally articulated brick and masonry buildings to metal-clad or cement-block buildings.|$|E
50|$|In a flat metal workpiece, the {{flatness}} is {{a descriptive}} attribute characterizing {{the extent of}} the geometric deviation from a reference plane. The deviation from complete flatness is the direct result of the workpiece relaxation after hot or cold rolling, due to the internal stress pattern caused by the non-uniform transversal compressive action of the rolls and the uneven geometrical properties of the entry material. The <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution</b> of differential strain/elongation-induced stress with respect to the material's average applied stress is commonly referenced to as shape. Due to the strict relationship between shape and flatness, these terms can be used in an interchangeable manner. In the case of metal strips and sheets, the flatness reflects the differential fiber elongation across the width of the workpiece. This property must be subject to an accurate feedback-based control in order to guarantee the machinability of the metal sheets in the final transformation processes. Some technological details about the feedback control of flatness are given in.|$|E

We study distribution of the momenta of the photoelectrons, ionized by a strong laser field, emitted in the direction perpendicular to the polarization plane (<b>transverse</b> <b>distribution).</b> We show, that with changing laser pulse ellipticity, the <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution</b> evolves from the singular cusp-like distribution for the close to linear polarization to the smooth gaussian-like structure for the close to circular polarization.

40|$|The common {{approach}} used to quantify bridge critical load cases is to generalise {{the effect of}} dynamics. Site specific dynamic characteristics and the <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution</b> of dynamic amplification across the bridge section lacks consideration. In this paper, both issues are discussed using simulations of the passage of heavy traffic over an experimentally validated beam-and-slab bridge model.

In fact, this expression applies to particles with vanishing betatron amplitude in a beam with uniform <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution.</b> It is argued that an average over the <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution</b> should be used instead of the value on axis. It is shown that for the realistic `binomial' family of distributions the 1 in the above expression for g should be replaced by a value near 0. 5 if a is interpreted as twice the rms width of the beam...|$|E

The equilibrium shape is shown to depend on both channel characteristics and beam parameters. To check these predictions an experi-ment on a 0. 5 -MeV proton beam transported through a 29 -cell quadrupole FODO channel is presented.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution</b> of lane loading {{is one of}} {{the most}} concern for the {{assembly}} prefabricated T-girder bridges. Longitudinal influence line and <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution</b> coefficient are used in the traditional calculation method of lane loading effects. But, many research results show this method brings a little big error because of the simplification. Along with the advance of computer technology in mathematics, it is not difficult to use the 3 D FEM model to calculate the inner force that caused by vehicle load in girder bridge. In this paper, some comparatively accurate 3 D FEM models are established to analyze the lane loading effects on the simply supported T-girder bridge. The results show that the moment and shear force of each girder are quite different between traditional method and 3 D FEM model. The results indicate that the traditional method in current code is non-conservative...|$|E

40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{the behavior of}} electron bunch charge produced in an L band normal conducting radio frequency gun from Cs 2 Te photocathodes illuminated with ps long UV laser pulses and presumed homogeneous flattop laser <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution.</b> The measured charge shows the expected linear dependence in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime at low laser pulse energies. At higher laser pulse energy, the measured charge in the space charge limited emission regime should saturate, assuming an ideal homogeneous flattop laser <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution.</b> However, this behavior is not observed experimentally. Instead of saturating, the measured charge continues to increase with laser pulse energy, albeit with much weaker dependence than in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime. Simulations with the space charge particle tracking code ASTRA show that the charge saturates as expected using a homogeneous flattop laser <b>transverse</b> <b>distribution.</b> The discrepancy between simulations and measured excess charge {{may be attributed to}} the presence of unintentional Gaussian like decaying radial halo beyond the core of the otherwise presumed homogeneous flattop core. The rate of increase of the measured charge at high laser pulse energies seems to be proportional to the amount of halo despite charge saturation in the core of the transverse laser radial profile. By utilizing core halo particle distributions based on measured radial laser profiles, ASTRA simulations and semi analytical emission models reproduce the behavior of the measured charge {{for a wide range of}} RF gun and laser operational parameters within the measurement uncertaintie...|$|E
