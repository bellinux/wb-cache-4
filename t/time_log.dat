This is the rst such data structure to simultaneously achieve query <b>time</b> (<b>log</b> n) o(1) and update time O(2 (log n) c) for a constant c < 1. 1 Introduction Among the most fundamental data structures is the dictionary. A dictionary stores a subset S of a universe U, oering membership queries of the form 2 S?". The result of a membership query is either 'no' or a piece of satellite data associated with x. Updates of the set are supported via insertion and deletion of single elements. Several performance measures are of interest for dictionaries: The amount of space used, the time needed to answer queries, and the time needed to perform updates.

30|$|In practice, {{the update}} rule Equation 17 can be {{implemented}} through periodic exchange of estimated correlation terms between immediate neighbors. To calculate these quantities, a node keeps a <b>time</b> <b>log</b> of channel utilization in its immediate neighborhood that also includes the node itself. A sufficiently long measurement interval would allow the equilibrium probabilities to be estimated by using the <b>time</b> <b>log.</b> To have a flavor of the required length of this interval, we note that each probability to be estimated is between 0 and 1; so its variation is at most 0.25. Hence, if the samples are taken sufficiently apart in time {{so that they are}} roughly independent, Chebyshev's inequality implies that (4 ε 2)- 1 samples would be enough to estimate each probability within an error margin of ε, with probability at least max(0, 1 -ε). Once the measurement interval expires, the node exchanges its measurements of π-terms in Equation 17 with its immediate neighbors and changes probabilities P according to Equation 17. Then, the node starts its <b>time</b> <b>log</b> over to get new measurements of correlation terms. Similarly, the greedy version of Equation 17 would require a node to keep a log of only its own channel utilization without local information exchange.|$|E

30|$|A field {{observation}} {{was performed}} in July and August 2014. Twenty students were recruited and trained to observe employees’ job performance using the log sheet. Two teachers were responsible for coordinating the work onsite. Two training sessions were provided to students. Each student was responsible for real-time tracking of four workers’ work behaviors during working hours. They recorded the content of every worker’s time use every 10  min and formed a closed loop <b>time</b> <b>log</b> per day. We recorded the allocation of workers’ leisure time the following morning based on students’ logbooks. Anonymous investigation, double-blind entering, and repeated retrials were used to ensure the reliability of data collection.

We then prove that this running time is optimal. Next we present a circuit which always produces the correct answer.

We show that type equality may be decided in <b>time</b> O(n <b>log</b> n), an improvement over the previous known bound of O(n 2). In fact, we show that two more general problems, namely entailment of type equations and type unification, may be decided in <b>time</b> O(n <b>log</b> n), a new result. To achieve this bound, we associate, with every Fu type, a first-order canonical form, which may be computed in <b>time</b> O(n <b>log</b> n). By exploiting this notion, we reduce all three problems to equality and unification of first-order recursive terms, for which efficient algorithms are known...|$|R
