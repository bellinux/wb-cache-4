5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which {{was the type of}} mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

25|$|South African {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturer Cipla Medpro experienced {{difficulty in}} maintaining forecast accuracy {{as the company}} grew. The company was out of stock on 3 percent of its inventory at any given time, resulting in revenue losses {{that can never be}} recovered. The company implemented a demand modeling process that forecasts at both the product and the customer level. Today’s stock-outs are {{less than one percent of}} inventory and these are mostly caused by conditions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the company’s control.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} phasing {{effect is}} created by splitting an audio signal into two paths. One path treats the signal with an all-pass filter, which preserves the amplitude of the original signal and alters the phase. The amount of change in phase depends on the frequency. When signals from the two paths are mixed, the frequencies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of phase will cancel each other out, creating the phaser's characteristic notches. Changing the mix ratio changes {{the depth of the}} notches; the deepest notches occur when the mix ratio is 50%.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three-dimensional information of biological structures. However, this information is blurred by the fact that, upon illumination, all fluorescently labeled structures emit light, irrespective of whether they are in focus or not. So {{an image of a}} certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of focus. This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high resolving power, typically oil immersion objectives with a high numerical aperture.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, {{a remote}} control is a {{component}} of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E

According to data quoted by UNICEF, 23% of pumps in rural areas are out of service {{because of a lack}} of maintenance. According to data quoted by the World Bank, of the more than 50,000 water points in rural areas 33,000 (8,000 “modern wells” and 25,000 boreholes equipped with handpumps) are functioning, i.e. more than one third of wells are out of service. Of 570 small piped systems in rural areas, 400 are functioning, i.e. also almost one third are not functioning.|$|E
25|$|Endal's {{owner was}} Allen Parton. Parton {{suffered}} serious head injuries whilst serving with the Royal Navy in the Gulf in 1991, including 50% memory loss and inability to reliably make new memories {{for more than}} around 2 days (for example, not recognising his neighbour of 7 years), physical disability (he was a wheelchair user), speech and word difficulties, inability to perceive materials <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of his sight, and inability to safely judge speed and distance of traffic. For a considerable time after partnering with Endal, {{he was unable to}} speak and was limited to basic sign language. In 2008, commenting on a portrait of Endal, Parton said that one of his greatest fears was that, in 10 years, he would be unable to remember what Endal looked like. In February 2010, Allen registered a new charity, named Hounds for Heroes, in memory of Endal and to help {{men and women who have}} been injured in the UK Armed Forces and Emergency Services.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} and often difficult jobs of a mashgiach, however, is the checking in and verification of shipments. The mashgiach must ensure that every food product that arrives at the facility has a reliable hekhsher before it is used. Suppliers often substitute products <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of stock with non-kosher products. Non-kosher establishments would generally not mind these substitutions. For a kosher establishment, however, these substitutions can cause major problems. If a product arrives without a hekhsher, the mashgiach must make sure the product is clearly marked as non-kosher and is not used, but returned to the supplier. Sometimes a product arrives that is purportedly kosher, but no hekhsher can be found. In this case, the mashgiach obtains a valid letter of certification from the certifying rabbi or kashrut agency, usually by contacting the manufacturer. In addition to checking hekhsherim, the mashgiach must also check that all meat products that arrive are double sealed, usually by inner and outer plastic bags or an inner plastic bag and a sealed box, and that all wine is kosher wine.|$|E

500|$|Sony's PlayStation 3 console has no {{compatibility}} with the PlayStation 2 Guitar Hero controller on the system. While Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero II are fully backward-compatible through the hardware PlayStation 2 emulation {{in the initial}} North American release of the console, it was impossible at launch to use the guitar controller to play either game. Kai Huang, of RedOctane, states that they are [...] "working on that with Sony right now – looking at how we can get all the PlayStation 2 guitars <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> there, and all the owners of them, to use them on the PlayStation 3."

However, the May 2007 PlayStation 3 V1.80 system update has made the guitar controller compatible with generic PlayStation 2 controller to USB adapters when playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero II. In addition, Pelican Accessories has released a special controller adapter that supports both games, including the ability to switch the handedness of the guitar.|$|E

Existing games may receive updates to provide enhancements or additional 4K support for Xbox One X. Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow-up interview that he was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be [...] "up to the game development community what do they want to do."
