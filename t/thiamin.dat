5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of <b>thiamin,</b> riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
25|$|TPP riboswitches (also THI-box) binds <b>thiamin</b> {{pyrophosphate}} (TPP) {{to regulate}} <b>thiamin</b> biosynthesis and transport, {{as well as}} transport of similar metabolites. It is the only riboswitch found so far in eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|A {{side effect}} of the heating of {{pasteurization}} is that some vitamin and mineral content is lost. Soluble calcium and phosphorus decrease by 5%, <b>thiamin</b> and vitamin B12 by 10%, and vitamin C by 20%. Because losses are small {{in comparison to the}} large amount of the two B-vitamins present, milk continues to provide significant amounts of <b>thiamin</b> and vitamin B12. The loss of vitamin C is not nutritionally significant, as milk is not an important dietary source of vitamin C.|$|E

25|$|In industrialized nations, {{thiamine}} deficiency is a {{clinically significant}} problem in individuals with chronic alcoholism or other disorders {{that interfere with}} normal ingestion of food. Thiamine deficiency within developed nations tends to manifest as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Chronic alcoholism can disrupt <b>thiamin</b> absorption and <b>thiamin</b> deficiency contributes to neurodegeneration and memory loss in alcoholics known as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Individuals with chronic alcoholism may fall short on minimum daily requirements of thiamine {{in part due to}} anorexia, erratic eating habits, lack of available food, or a combination of any of these factors. Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake, reduced absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine. Alcohol, in combination with its metabolite acetaldehyde, interacts with thiamine utilization at the molecular level during transport, diphosphorylation, and modification processes. For this reason, chronic alcoholics may have insufficient thiamine for maintenance of normal brain function, even with seemingly adequate dietary intake.|$|E
25|$|Thiamine, {{also known}} as <b>thiamin</b> or vitamin B1, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement {{it is used to}} treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and disorders that result from it, including beriberi, Korsakoff's syndrome, and Korsakoff's psychosis. Other uses include maple syrup urine disease and Leigh's disease. It is taken by mouth or by injection.|$|E

25|$|Raw, yellow, sweet maize kernels are {{composed}} of 76% water, 19% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a 100-gram serving, maize kernels provide 86 calories and are a good source (10-19% of the Daily Value) of the B vitamins, <b>thiamin,</b> niacin, pantothenic acid (B5) and folate (right table for raw, uncooked kernels, USDA Nutrient Database). In moderate amounts, they also supply dietary fiber and the essential minerals, magnesium and phosphorus whereas other nutrients are in low amounts (table).|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{medications}} available to treat amnesia, underlying medical conditions can be treated to improve memory. Such conditions include {{but are not limited}} to low thyroid function, liver or kidney disease, stroke, depression, bipolar disorder and blood clots in the brain. Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome involves a lack of <b>thiamin</b> and replacing this vitamin by consuming thiamin-rich foods such as whole-grain cereals, legumes (beans and lentils), nuts, lean pork, and yeast. Treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol and illicit drug use can prevent further damage, but in most cases will not recover lost memory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the typical}} serving size of 1–3 cloves (3–9 grams), garlic {{provides}} no significant nutritional value, with {{the content of}} all essential nutrients below 10% of the Daily Value (DV) (table). When expressed per 100 grams, garlic contains several nutrients in rich amounts (20% {{or more of the}} DV), including vitamins B6 and C, and the dietary minerals, manganese and phosphorus. Per 100 gram serving, garlic is also a moderate source (10–19% DV) of certain B vitamins, including <b>thiamin</b> and pantothenic acid, as well as the dietary minerals, calcium, iron, and zinc (table).|$|E
25|$|Spinach retains {{nearly all}} its folate when cooked in a microwave; in comparison, it loses about 77% when boiled, {{leaching}} out nutrients. Bacon cooked by microwave has significantly {{lower levels of}} carcinogenic nitrosamines than conventionally cooked bacon. Steamed vegetables tend to maintain more nutrients when microwaved than when cooked on a stovetop. Microwave blanching is 3–4 times more effective than boiled water blanching in the retaining of the water-soluble vitamins folic acid, <b>thiamin</b> and riboflavin, {{with the exception of}} ascorbic acid, of which 28.8% is lost (vs. 16% with boiled water blanching).|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{three percent}} of people who are {{suffering}} from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the long-term effects of alcohol resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as <b>thiamin</b> deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments.|$|E
25|$|Marmite {{is rich in}} B {{vitamins}} including <b>thiamin</b> (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), {{folic acid}} (B9) and vitamin B12. The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount per serving rather than the percentage in bulk Marmite that is relevant. The main ingredient of Marmite is yeast extract, which contains {{a high concentration of}} glutamic acid. Marmite made in the United Kingdom and exported to several countries is almost gluten free. However, Unilever will not confirm that it contains less than 20 PPM of gluten, the current European standard and the proposed US FDA standard for gluten-free labelling.|$|E
25|$|Medication and {{supplemental}} niacin {{are primarily}} {{used to treat}} high blood cholesterol and pellagra (niacin deficiency). Insufficient niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. The lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency disease, which {{is caused by a}} lack of five crucial vitamins (niacin, vitamin C, <b>thiamin,</b> vitamin D, and vitamin A) and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition. Niacin is provided in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods, with highest contents in fortified packaged foods and meat from various animal sources. Some countries require its addition to grains.|$|E
25|$|Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps {{contain the}} enzyme thiaminase, which depletes {{the body of}} vitamin B1 (<b>thiamin).</b> It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} the egusi-itoo seed is 44% oil, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 4% ash and 3% fiber. The oil of this seed is 64.9% {{linoleic}} acid, 12.4% oleic acid, 11.8% stearic acid and 10.9% palmitic acid. Vitamins <b>Thiamin,</b> Niacin, B1 and B2 are also {{prevalent in the}} seed, {{as well as many}} micronutrients. Notable minerals include phosphorus, as the largest mineral component, with potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur, calcium, iron and zinc to follow. The bulk of carbohydrates are starch and soluble sugars. Egusi-itoo is the perfect complement to the largely starch-rich grain diet of Africa, providing a high-protein and high-energy concentrate. The seed contains every important macro and micro-nutrient in quantities ideal for nutrition. The amino acid content of egusi-itoo proteins makes it a sufficient vegetable protein. This composition is ideal for sick and growing bodies, providing essential amino acids and calories. Just 100 g of seed daily provides essential fatty acid, amino acid and Vitamin E requirements. There is potential for these seeds as a critical tool for interventions in diseases such as marasmus and kwashiorkor.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that alcohol {{dependence}} relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse {{has been shown to}} cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as <b>thiamin</b> deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.|$|E

2500|$|The {{body has}} only small stores of B1; accordingly, there is risk of {{deficiency}} if {{the level of}} intake is reduced {{only for a few}} weeks. <b>Thiamin</b> deficiency during critical periods of early development can disrupts neurogenesis in animal models. Lack of <b>thiamin</b> later in life causes the disease known as beriberi. There are two forms of beriberi: [...] "wet", and [...] "dry". Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi. Characteristics of wet beriberi include prominent edema and cardiac involvement, whereas dry beriberi is mainly characterized by a polyneuritis. Severe <b>thiamin</b> deficiency can also result in acute neurodegeneration leading to peripheral neuropathy and memory loss.|$|E
2500|$|Deficiency of {{thiamine}} (also {{known as}} vitamin B1) brings {{the risk of}} permanent neurological damage (i.e. Wernicke's encephalopathy or polyneuropathy).

2500|$|The {{catalysis}} of {{this mechanism}} is {{initiated by the}} deprotonation of TPP at the thiazolium ring. [...] This carbanion then binds to the carbonyl of the donor substrate thus cleaving the bond between C-2 and C-3. [...] This keto fragment remains covalently bound to the C-2 carbon of TPP. [...] The donor substrate is then released, and the acceptor substrate enters the active site where the fragment, which is bound to the intermediate α-β-dihydroxyethyl <b>thiamin</b> diphosphate, is then transferred to the acceptor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} complete a fermentation with minimum to no negative attributes {{being added to}} the wine, yeast needs to have the full assortment of its nutritional needs met. These include not only an available energy source (carbon {{in the form of}} sugars such as glucose) and yeast assimilable nitrogen (ammonia and amino acids or YAN) but also minerals (such as magnesium) and vitamins (such as <b>thiamin</b> and riboflavin) that serve as important growth and survival factors. Among the other nutritional needs of wine yeast: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of this pathway, His263 is used to {{effectively}} abstract the C3 hydroxyl proton, which thus allows a 2-carbon segment to be cleaved from fructose 6-phosphate. The cofactor necessary for this step to occur is <b>thiamin</b> pyrophosphate (TPP). [...] The binding of TPP to the enzyme incurs no major conformational change to the enzyme; instead, the enzyme has two flexible loops at the active site that make TPP accessible and binding possible. Thus, this allows the active site to have a [...] "closed" [...] conformation rather than a large conformational change. Later in the pathway, His263 is used as a proton donor for the substrate acceptor-TPP complex, which can then generate erythrose-4-phosphate.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} {{of a lack of}} certain nutrition due to altered eating habits, various health problems can occur, from the mild to the extreme. [...] Lack of certain vitamins (A, E and C) and low levels of riboflavin and <b>thiamin</b> can produce a variety of conditions, ranging from constipation, weight loss, arthritis and rheumatism. There are more serious conditions such as heart disease and Parkinson's disease and even to the extreme, certain types of Cancer. [...] Treatments include changing approaches to eating such as cutting food in advance to make eating easier and less likely to avoid as well as consumer health products such as multivitamins and multi-minerals specifically designed to support the nutritional issues experienced by denture wearers.|$|E
50|$|The salt <b>thiamin</b> mononitrate, {{rather than}} <b>thiamin</b> hydrochloride, {{is used for}} food fortification, as the mononitrate is more stable, and does not absorb water from natural {{humidity}} (is non-hygroscopic), whereas <b>thiamin</b> hydrochloride is hygroscopic.
