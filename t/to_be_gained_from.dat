Secondly, it is shown that a sufficient condition for there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> unilateral free trade is that the domestic firm is so uncompetitive that it ceases production under free trade.

This paper considers several scenarios, notably one where net savings of the surplus countries decline so that the world real interest rate rises, and another where the US fiscal deficit is reduced, so that the world real interest rate falls and there could be a world wide aggregate demand problem, essentially caused by the high net savings of the surplus countries. ...|$|R

25|$|Advocates of neo-liberal {{economics}} {{argue that}} while import substitution policies might create {{jobs in the}} short run, as domestic producers replace foreign producers, neoliberal theory believes {{that in the long}} run output and growth will be lower than it would otherwise have been. This is because import substitution denies the country the benefits <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>from</b> specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency: Domestic producers have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{there are}} many {{families}} of graphs that are close enough analogues of formal languages {{that the concept of}} a calculus is quite easily and naturally extended to them. Indeed, many species of graphs arise as parse graphs in the syntactic analysis of the corresponding families of text structures. The exigencies of practical computation on formal languages frequently demand that text strings be converted into pointer structure renditions of parse graphs, simply as a matter of checking whether strings are well-formed formulas or not. Once this is done, {{there are many}} advantages <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>from</b> developing the graphical analogue of the calculus on strings. The mapping from strings to parse graphs is called parsing and the inverse mapping from parse graphs to strings is achieved by an operation that is called traversing the graph.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Hudson River School, {{prominent}} in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them.

Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as Albert Bierstadt, created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature.

In 1988, Kinzel saw a report on CNN about the opening of a new coaster in Japan called Bandit at Yomiuriland that emphasized height and speed but had no inversions. Kinzel wanted to introduce a similar coaster that emphasized steep drops and negative g-forces over inversions and spins, which were common at the time. It had been 10 years since the last major addition, Gemini, was introduced. Cedar Point asked for proposals from TOGO, Dinn Corporation, Intamin and Arrow Dynamics to build a roller coaster without inversions or over-the-shoulder restraints.
