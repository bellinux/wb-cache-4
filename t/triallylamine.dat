30|$|<b>Triallylamine</b> (20  mmol, 2.74  g) and 3 -bromo-propanol (20  mmol, 2.78  g) were {{dissolved}} in ethanol (15  mL). The mixture was then stirred at 80  °C for 24  h under nitrogen atmosphere. On completion, the solvent was removed by distillation and the solid product was washed with ethyl acetate {{three times to}} remove the unreacted substrates. After drying under vacuum, hydroxypropyl functionalized <b>triallylamine</b> (HTA) was obtained. 1 H NMR (400  MHz, D 2 O, TMS) δ(ppm)[*]=[*] 1.93 (t, 2 H, CH 2), 3.21 (m, 2 H, CH 2), 3.51 (m, 2 H, CH 2), 3.62 (d, 6 H, CH 2), 5.81 (m, 6 H, CH 2), 5.94 (d, 3 H, CH). The butyl functionalized <b>triallylamine</b> (BTA) was prepared accordingly {{in the same way}} and then was characterized by 1 H NMR (400  MHz, D 2 O, TMS) δ(ppm)[*]=[*] 1 H NMR (400  MHz, D 2 O, TMS) δ(ppm)[*]=[*] 0.86 (t, 3 H, CH 3), 1.26 (m, 2 H, CH 2), 1.69 (m, 2 H, CH 2), 3.13 (t, 2 H, CH 2), 3.72 (d, 6 H, CH 2), 5.59 (d, 6 H, CH 2), 5.90 (m, 3 H, CH).|$|E

Styrene oxide (SO), allyl glycidyl ether (AGE), and cyclohexene oxide (CHO) were provided by Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Other reagents were laboratory-grade reagents from local suppliers.|$|E
40|$|Microcapsules with triallylamine-containing core {{surrounded}} by polyelectrolyte shell of controlled thickness were prepared via layer-by-layer assembly technology. First, isocyanate end-capped polyurethane was synthesized through {{the reaction of}} isophorone diisocyanate and poly(1, 4 -butylene adipate). Then, polyurea microcapsules containing <b>triallylamine</b> were prepared by the interfacial polymerization with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) as the water-phase macro-monomer and the prepared isocyanate end-capped polyurethane as the oil-phase macro-monomer. Finally, stable weak polyelectrolyte microcapsules were prepared by assembly of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and branehed PEI to build up polyelectrolyte multi-layers, and {{this was followed by}} glutaraldehyde mediated cross-linking to further increase the mechanical strength of the final capsules. Results showed that the obtained microcapsules were narrowly distributed in size and the mean diameter could be adjusted. This kind of capsule might be used to construct pressure-sensitive materials. Microcapsules are small spheres with a uniform wall around it. The material inside the microcapsule is called the core, whereas the wall {{is referred to as the}} shell. The reasons for micro-encapsulation are varied. For example, sometimes the core must be isolated from its surroundings...|$|E
40|$|EP 264710 A UPAB: 19940303 New {{water-soluble}} quat. poly{{ammonium salt}}s (I) are prepd. by radical-catalysed homo- or copolymerisation of an unsatd. quat. ammonium salt (II). When this conversion of (II) reaches 25 - 90 %, a crosslinking comonomer (III) is added in an amt. of 0. 1 - 3 mole. % based on (II). The prod. comprises (a) 10 - 100 wt. % {{of a highly}} branched polymer with a molecular wt. above 100, 000, comprising 97 - 99. 9 mole. % of units derived from (II) and 0. 1 - 3 mole. % of units derived from (III), and (b) 0 - 90 wt. % of a linear homopolymer of (II). Component (a) has 1 - 25 branch sites per 100 monomer units. (II) is esp. dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride, but may also be another dimethyl diallyl ammonium salt, a vinylpyridinium salt or a quat. ester or amide of (meth) acrylic acid. (III) is a 1 - 3 C alkyl triallyl ammonium salt, a tetraallyl ammonium salt, a tetraallyl alkylenediamine salt, a <b>triallylamine</b> salt or methylene bisacrylamide. Polymerisation is effected at 18 - 65 deg. C, using a 30 - 70 % aq. soln. of (II). USE/ADVANTAGE - (I) are useful as flocculating agents, demulsifiers for breaking o/w emulsions, and for prodn. of electrically conductive films, e. g. on electrophotographic paper. The process gives high-molecular-wt. highly branched prods. with a low content of short-chain components, without the risk of gel formation...|$|E
40|$|Absolute {{asymmetric}} synthesis is {{the synthesis of}} optically active products from achiral or racemic precursors only. This has generally been regarded as impossible and is relevant {{in the discussion of}} the origins of biomolecular homochirality. A possible route to absolute {{asymmetric synthesis}} involves total spontaneous resolution, which is possible for stereochemically labile substances which crystallise as conglomerates (i. e. the enantiomers crystallise in separate crystals). Using total spontaneous resolution it was, for the first time, possible to prepare bulk-quantities of configurationally labile five-, seven-, and nine-coordinate enantiomers, containing only achiral ligands. Previously, only four- and six-coordinate complexes have been prepared enantiomerically pure in bulk quantities. Spontaneous resolution of eight-coordinate complexes has also been reported. It was also possible to perform total spontaneous resolution of a diaryl sulphide, an octanuclear organo(oxo) zinc complex, and a diindenylzinc complex. In the case of a helical coordination polymer based on copper(I) chloride and <b>triallylamine,</b> it was found that repeated synthesis always yielded an excess of the same enantiomer, possibly due to the influence of cryptochirality. It has previously been practically impossible to measure enantiomeric excesses in stereochemically labile microcrystalline samples. A method utilising quantitative solid-state CD spectroscopy has been introduced to solve this problem. In the case of the chiral organometallic reagent di(3 -picoline) di(1 -indenyl) zinc, it was possible to perform reactions with N-chlorosuccinimide in the presence of methanol and p-benzoquinone yielding optically active stereochemically inert 1 -chloroindene in high yield and high enantiomeric excess (up to 89 % ee). During the cause of theses studies, three cases of concomitant crystallisation of racemic and chiral phases have been discovered. This is a rare phenomenon of considerable interest e. g. in structure prediction. The first synthetic route to well-defined hydridoalkylzincates is also reported...|$|E
