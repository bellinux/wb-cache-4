25|$|While {{a student}} in college he wrote his first {{collection}} of poems entitled The Brunette <b>Told</b> <b>Me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a collection of romantic verses that made several startling references to a woman's body, sending shock waves throughout the conservative society in Damascus. To make it more acceptable, Qabbani showed it to Munir al-Ajlani, the minister of education {{who was also a}} friend of his father and a leading nationalist leader in Syria. Ajlani liked the poems and endorsed them by writing the preface for Nizar's first book.|$|E

5000|$|That {{is often}} omitted when used to {{introduce}} a subordinate clause—"He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good read." [...] {{could just as easily}} <b>be</b> [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good read." [...] Historically, [...] "that" [...] usually followed a comma: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good read." [...] Middle Modern English grammarian Joseph Robertson recommended in On Punctuation that a comma be used with a conjunction. However, if the subordinate, conjunctional ellipse, null complement, or syntactic pleonasm of [...] "that" [...] is punctuated with a comma, then, in the English grammar, stylistically speaking, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a comma splice, especially in formal writing. Instead, a semicolon should be used to be grammatically correct: He told me; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good read. In grammar, the usage of [...] "that" [...] constitutes a that-clause while its absence constitutes a bare clause.|$|R
500|$|MacMillan {{testified that}} for the {{duration}} of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee [...] "from terror and because he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break." [...] She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.|$|E

500|$|When the Department of Labor reissued federal {{guidelines}} in April 2010 governing {{the employment of}} unpaid interns under the Fair Labor Standards Act based on a 1947 Supreme Court decision, Stossel criticized the guidelines, appearing in a police uniform during an appearance on the Fox News program America Live, commenting, [...] "I’ve built my career on unpaid interns, and the interns <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> great– I learned more from you than I did in college." [...] Asked why he did not pay them if they were so valuable, {{he said he could}} not afford to.|$|E

[...] He said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick. In 1991, he told Rose that, {{throughout}} the interview, the police were saying, [...] "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," [...] and [...] "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" [...] He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again.

500|$|Fields edited Steven Spielberg's {{first major}} film, The Sugarland Express (1974). She became widely celebrated {{for her work}} as the film editor on Spielberg's next film, Jaws (1975), for which she won both the Academy Award for Film Editing and the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award in 1976. Leonard Maltin has {{characterized}} her editing as [...] "sensational". Gerald Peary, who interviewed Fields in 1980, wrote that, [...] "Jaws scared the world, brought in a fortune for Universal, and made Verna Fields, who won an Academy Award, about as famous 'overnight' as an editor ever gets." [...] He then quoted Fields as saying that, [...] "Steven <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because I had cut the first picture that was a monumental success {{in which you can}} really see the editing. And people discovered that it was a woman who edited Jaws." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E

500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were {{given the opportunity to}} comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E

5000|$|In every {{movement}} its form {{and above all}} its climax were clearly in Elgar's mind. Indeed, as he has often <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the climax which he invariably settles first. But withal {{there is a great}} mass of fluctuating material which might fit into the work as it developed in his mind to finality - for <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> created in the same [...] "oven" [...] which had cast them all. Nothing satisfied him until itself and its context seemed, as he said, inevitable.|$|R

2500|$|R. Lee Ermey, {{an actor}} in Kubrick's film Full Metal Jacket, claimed that Kubrick phoned him two weeks before his death to express his despondency over Eyes Wide Shut.

Armstrong described the fiery 240mph crash of his Dodge Challenger at Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Yeah, {{that was kind of}} a bad one," [...] he said.

Dillon had built a strong early career in a Childress-blessed No. 3, first in the Camping World Truck Series, then in the Nationwide Series. Childress had polled fans at the beginning of 2013 about Dillon taking No. 3, to the Sprint Cup series, which received 90% positive feedback.

Lyudmila Maksakova remembered: [...] "Many years later a [...] Moscow Art Theatre actor whom I met at the Morocco Film festival revealed to me {{the name of my}} father: Aleksander Volkov, the singer with the Bolshoi. 'Your father did not want to live in the USSR, he crossed the frontline and soon in the USA opened an opera and drama school,' this man <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> only then that I saw the reasons behind my mother's fear – not for herself, but for me, her only daughter."

A disgusted Benson later told author Ben Edmonds, [...] "I saw this and started wondering 'what was going on, what is happening here?' One question led to another. Why are they sending kids far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own kids in the street?" [...] Returning to Detroit, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland wrote and composed a song based on his conversations with Benson {{of what he had}} seen in Berkeley. Benson sent the unfinished song to his bandmates but the other Four Tops turned the song down. Benson said, [...] "My partners <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a protest song. I said 'no man it's a love song, about love and understanding. I'm not protesting. I want to know what's going on.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|That is {{the name}} which the {{northern}} Indians give to the black-capped tit-mouse, or chickadee.
