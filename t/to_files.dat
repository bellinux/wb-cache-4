Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to blow up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, Guetzloe {{was found}} guilty of two {{misdemeanor}} counts of willful failure <b>to</b> <b>file</b> tax returns.

In 2007, {{there had been a}} proposal that thrifts convert <b>to</b> <b>filing</b> a similar report, the Report of Condition and Income commonly referred to as the Call Report, which banks prepare and file with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

25|$|JPEG is {{also not}} well suited <b>to</b> <b>files</b> that will undergo {{multiple}} edits, as some image quality will usually be lost each time the image is decompressed and recompressed, particularly if the image is cropped or shifted, or if encoding parameters are changed– see digital generation loss for details. To avoid this, an image that is being modified or may be modified in the future can be saved in a lossless format, with a copy exported as JPEG for distribution.|$|E

Sizemore called the charges politically inspired and said he had paid $50,000 in estimated taxes for 2006 and 2007. In 2011 he pleaded guilty to three counts of felony tax evasion for failure <b>to</b> <b>file</b> these state income-tax returns, with a plea agreement to serve 30 days jail and 3 years probation.|$|R
25|$|HyperCard saw {{a loss in}} {{popularity}} {{with the growth of}} the World Wide Web, since the Web could handle and deliver data {{in much the same way}} as HyperCard without being limited <b>to</b> <b>files</b> on a local hard disk. HyperCard had a significant impact on the web as it inspired the creation of both HTTP (through its influence on Tim Berners-Lee's colleague Robert Cailliau), and JavaScript (whose creator, Brendan Eich, was inspired by HyperTalk). It was also a key inspiration for ViolaWWW, an early web browser.|$|E
25|$|When an {{operating}} system is {{running on a}} system without file encryption, access <b>to</b> <b>files</b> normally goes through OS-controlled user authentication and access control lists. However, if an attacker gains physical access to the computer, this barrier can be easily circumvented. One way, for example, would be to remove the disk {{and put it in}} another computer with an OS installed that can read the filesystem; another, would be to simply reboot the computer from a boot CD containing an OS that is suitable for accessing the local filesystem.|$|E
25|$|Information {{management}} (IM) is {{the collection}} and management of information from one or more sources {{and the distribution of}} that information to one or more audiences. This sometimes involves those who have a stake in, or a right to that information. Management means the organization of and control over the structure, processing and delivery of information. Throughout the 1970s this was largely limited <b>to</b> <b>files,</b> file maintenance, and the life cycle management of paper-based files, other media and records. With the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s, the job of information management took on a new light and also began to include the field of data maintenance.|$|E

The system transaction hold limit sets the number of system transactions performed during write operations for shared files.|$|E
25|$|Several {{additional}} utilities {{were published}} in the May 1987 issue of Compute!'s Gazette along with SpeedScript 3.2. ScriptRead was developed to identify and preview SpeedScript documents on a disk, with the ability to scratch any files no longer needed. This was an important addition as on a single-drive system there would be no way to save work if the disk became full. SpeedSearch provided full-text search of all SpeedScript documents on a disk, returning a count of how many times the searched word or phrase was used in each document. Date and Time Stamper introduces a program to the disk drive that adds time stamps <b>to</b> <b>files</b> on disk, then executes SpeedScript.|$|E
25|$|However, {{while some}} {{former members of}} Criterion were {{attracted}} into the Iron Guard, the Credința writers were still critical of totalitarianism. Before a fascist government was formed by the minor National Christian Party, Credința hosted contributions from Alexandru Mironescu, the physicist and center-nationalist author. These documented the encroachment of liberal democracy in Europe, defended political freedoms, and honored Romanian peacemaker Nicolae Titulescu. Although situated to the left, Credința and Floarea de Foc were largely anti-communistic, and Tudor's own news digests took a highly critical view of the Soviet Union. In one such piece, he expressed alarm about {{the outcome of the}} Moscow Trials. However, according <b>to</b> <b>files</b> kept by the Siguranța Statului police force, Tudor still intended to collaborate with communist agent Scarlat Callimachi on the anti-fascist review Munca ("The Labor").|$|E

Respondents noted a greater need <b>to</b> <b>file</b> reports when children fell while they were with nurses rather than their parents. Nurses did not think that all falls should be reported.

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{successful}} application of the CCU method {{can be found at}} Exact Software (ES). ES is a manufacturer of accounting and enterprise resource planning software based in the Netherlands. ES has combined Product Data Management (PDM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Software Configuration Management (SCM) {{in order to maintain the}} configuration at the customer site in a better and less complex way. ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds <b>to</b> <b>files</b> that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to the SCM system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.|$|E
500|$|The Trash (or [...] "Wastebasket" [...] in the British version) empties {{when the}} Finder terminates. If MultiFinder is not running, this occurs {{as soon as}} an {{application}} launches. Icons on the desktop in System 6 are not organized into a single folder, as in later operating systems. Instead, the system records whether each file is on the desktop or not. This is inefficient and confusing, as the user cannot browse to the desktop in applications besides the Finder, even within the standard Open and Save As dialog boxes. Furthermore, these dialogs are primitive, mostly unchanged since 1984. The lack of aliases, shortcuts <b>to</b> <b>files,</b> was another limitation of file management on System 6. Custom file and folder icons are also not supported. These problems were all remedied in System 7.|$|E
