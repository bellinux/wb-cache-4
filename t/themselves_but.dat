5|$|Because of {{excellent}} thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure {{similar to that of}} carbon nanotubes, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> the properties are very different.|$|E
5|$|Local people {{sometimes}} take pups for the exotic pet trade or as pets for <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates {{the story of}} an Arawak Indian who took two pups from their parents. While revealing of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was a profound blow to the breeding pair, which went on to lose their territory to competitors.|$|E

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|Rankings tend to {{concentrate}} on representing MBA schools <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).|$|E
5|$|The Copenhagen interpretation, Part I ("There is no deep reality.") Most notably {{associated}} with Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, Herbert identifies {{this as the}} most broadly accepted interpretation among physicists. In this interpretation, dynamic attributes do not describe the reality of quantum objects <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> inhere instead {{in the relationship between}} the observed object and the measurement device.|$|E

5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were {{once thought to be}} a way by which {{individuals}} identified <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be used to identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E

5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several times larger than <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E
5|$|National nature {{reserves}} in England (NNR) are designated under Part III of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 that are {{deemed to be}} of national importance by Natural England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England using section 35(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed {{on behalf of the}} nation, many by Natural England <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> also by non-governmental organisations, including Avon Wildlife Trust or the Somerset Wildlife Trust, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|River otters are not scavengers; {{they avoid}} {{consuming}} carrion. Northern river otters do not generally handle prey {{of a large}} size relative to <b>themselves</b> <b>but</b> there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a river otter) are hibernating. Remains of the much larger American beaver {{have been found in}} otter scat in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where otters and beaver are sympatric do not show them to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that otters frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young beaver kits may be attacked.|$|E

5|$|Roman provinces traded among <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> trade {{extended}} {{outside the}} frontiers to regions {{as far away}} as China and India. The main commodity was grain. Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the Silk Road; Indian trade, however, also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports on the Red Sea. Also traded were olive oil, various foodstuffs, garum (fish sauce), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, pottery, glassware, marble, papyrus, spices and materia medica, ivory, pearls, and gemstones.|$|E

They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the whole idea. Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|The first European American {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, {{and the first}} sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.|$|E

5|$|The {{intermittent}} Roman {{presence in}} Scotland {{coincided with the}} emergence of the Picts, a confederation of tribes who lived {{to the north of the}} Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century. They are often assumed to have been the descendants of the Caledonians though the evidence for this connection is circumstantial and the name by which the Picts called themselves is unknown. They are often said to have tattooed <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their monumental stones. The Gaels of Dalriada called the Picts Cruithne, and Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound <b>themselves</b> <b>but</b> instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E
5|$|Tigers usually {{prefer to}} eat prey they have caught <b>themselves,</b> <b>but</b> are not above eating carrion {{in times of}} {{scarcity}} and may even pirate prey from other large carnivores. Although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and crocodiles on occasion. Tigers may also prey on these competitors. Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly predatory. Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers {{and in some cases}} even kill them.|$|E
