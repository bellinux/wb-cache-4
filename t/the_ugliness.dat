While {{some have argued that}} the Pennsylvania System was Quaker-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's Pennsylvania Prison Society) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, William White. Proponents of the system believed strongly that the criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts of their behavior and <b>the</b> <b>ugliness</b> of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante {{continued}} {{to write and}} record solo material. He had been doing so {{since the age of}} nine, but had never considered releasing his material to the public. That was until several of his friends—including Johnny Depp, Perry Farrell, Gibby Haynes and former Red Hot Chili Peppers band mate Flea—encouraged him to release the material he wrote in his spare time during the Blood Sugar Sex Magik sessions. Frusciante began working on final cuts of the songs he had been writing, and producing them at his home in mid-1992. The production process, however, became hampered by his increasingly severe addiction to heroin. Usually Just a T-Shirt was recorded in the order it appears, with the final tracks being recorded shortly prior to Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers. Frusciante's use of heroin and cocaine became more extreme during the final stages of recording in late 1993; he began viewing drugs as the only way to [...] "make sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting <b>the</b> <b>ugliness</b> of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
500|$|Detailing and protesting <b>the</b> <b>ugliness</b> {{of life is}} {{a common}} theme {{throughout}} the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth [...] "be seen and... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it.... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say." [...] The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Misères de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisXIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting <b>the</b> <b>ugliness</b> of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{introduce}} <b>the</b> notion of <b>ugliness</b> as an aesthetic category, concerning the question of {{its position in the}} aesthetic experience, based in particular on the conception of difficult beauty by Bernard Bosanquet. The first part of the thesis discusses the possibility of aesthetic experiencing of unpleasantness and so specifies ugliness as inherently aesthetic category, in comparison to the unaesthetic response of disgust. The second part of the thesis deals with the question of position of <b>ugliness</b> and <b>the</b> feeling of unpleasantness if ugliness is an adequate part of the aesthetic experience which is regarded as excellent and contributing. The solution offered by Bosanquet in his conception of difficult beauty however isn't fully sufficient and therefore the last chapter introduces <b>the</b> problem of <b>ugliness</b> from a different viewpoint which emphasizes the negativity and disturbance of ugliness, impossible to dissolve. The key feature of <b>ugliness</b> is <b>the</b> ambivalent link amongst the repulsion and the attraction in aesthetic experiencing.

2500|$|Similarly, Norman Manea placed Negoiţescu's public {{profile in}} {{relation}} with the aesthetic ideals of his work: [...] "The indestructible attachment toward beauty and aesthetics has fortified the otherwise sober and frail being of the writer through times of Iron Guardist exultation, {{as well as through}} times of communist disarray and persecution. [...] <b>The</b> <b>ugliness,</b> barbarity, vulgarity and stupidity into which the great totalitarian setup quickly crumbles have proved themselves [...] rejected by Beauty." [...] Matei Călinescu mentioned his older friend's [...] "internally proud awareness of his own genius", as manifested against such definitions of genius as were being favored by [...] "communist cultural parochialism". Contrasting Negoiţescu's [...] "aestheticism", [...] "individualism" [...] and [...] "quasi-anarchism" [...] with the [...] "gray, stiff and fear-impregnated everyday of communism", Călinescu also noted: [...] "Nego's daily heroism was that of being himself, no matter what the consequences of this social preservation of his identity and the refusal to hide it."

2500|$|Morgan {{often had}} a {{tremendous}} physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling [...] "as if a gale had blown through the house." [...] Morgan was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose (because of a chronic skin disease, rosacea). [...] He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed; {{as a result of}} his self-consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched. [...] His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. [...] As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt [...] "Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue." [...] Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child Morgan suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son-in-law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return. [...] His social and professional self-confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. [...] It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over <b>the</b> <b>ugliness</b> of his face. [...] Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} delves into Bucharest's bohemian environment, its heroes being vagrants, misfits or alcoholics {{who lead}} tragicomic lifestyles. The plot, deemed [...] "to die for" [...] by Galaicu-Păun, notably shows writer and former inmate Aldu Rădulescu seducing literary chronicler Alteea Fleciu, as revenge for a negative review of his work. In Paul Aretzu's view, {{the manner in}} which such developments are presented constitutes [...] "a continuous demonstration of brilliant intelligence and spectacular linguistic imagination." [...] He commends a chapter of the book, which discusses how groups of people differentiated by their respective drinking cultures, for being [...] "a sort of poem dedicated to the kinds of drink and drunks in a small alcoholic town", while noting that a similar section, dedicated to the attitudes of writers when faced with fatal diseases, [...] "creates, with the means of the grotesque, a sui generis mythology of the writers' caste". The latter episode is praised by Ştefănescu for its [...] "irresistible" [...] black humor and its [...] "devilish verve". The same commentator states: [...] "The novelist has a joy of writing that transmits itself to the reader. After you finish reading this novel about <b>the</b> <b>ugliness</b> of (literary) life , you feel, paradoxically, the joy of living, of communicating, of partaking in the captivating spectacle of being." [...] In Artezu's account, those parts of Căderea Bastiliei in which Gârbea discusses the annual competition for literary prizes offer evidence both a [...] "captivating" [...] humorous focus on everyday occurrences and an [...] "innocent cynicism, characteristic for the author". He argues: [...] "With all the signs of his emotional involvement , the author also exercises, through correlations [...] quotes, the function of depersonalization, of estrangement, of laughing at one's misfortunes, of projecting oneself into clichés, [...] of surrogate existence." [...] Literary reviewer Cosmin Ciotloş issues a more reserved verdict on the text: in his view, the episodes of Căderea Bastiliei are primarily [...] "charades", whose main quality is being [...] "droll".|$|E
