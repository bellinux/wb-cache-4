We propose a novel way to measure cultural barriers using genetic distance, i. e. coancestor coefficients from population genetics. Our econometric methodology addresses the problem of spatial correlation inherent in having pairwise income differences as our dependent variable. We find a significant effect of genetic distance on income differences, even when controlling for geographical distance, differences in latitude, and other cultural and geographic distance measures. These results hold not only for contemporary income differences, but also for income differences measured as of 1500 and 1700. We uncover similar patterns of coefficients for the proximate determinants of income differences (differences in human capital, institutions, investment rates and population growth). Our results suggest an important role for vertically transmitted characteristics in the diffusion of development...|$|E

Using estimates of the key model parameters available in the demographic and genetics literature as well as our own estimate of the genetic transmission parameter (based on a new longevity dataset), we …nd that genetic factors (nature) cannot explain more than 32 percent of the cross-sectional variance in longevity.

The insurrection of the Indians which {{broke out}} in Mexico at the {{occasion}} of the war with the United States (1816 - 1848) provoked the awareness of an Indian problem and the creation of national project based upon miscegenation. The Indian recognized as being "civilizable" is condemned to disappear by means of racial fusion. The importance of the white race in the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics,</b> which is taken as law, is the guarantee that the biological amalgamation born of such union will be white. Nevertheless, it is judged wise to entrust the task of "whitening" the country into the hand of immigrants from Southern Europe which the State has carefully selected. The socio-economic dimension of the Indian problem is not ignored, however. Rather, until the Revolution, this problem remains within the framework of racialist paradigm which only very exceptionally leads specialists in the Indian question, even those influenced by theories of social darwinism, to assume racist positions.

40|$|Heredity {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} genetic <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{characteristics}}</b> from parent to offspring. This, however, is an oversimplification. The child does not inherit characteristics or traits from its parents. Children do not inherit musical ability, criminal tendencies, or IQ. Neither do they inherit physical characteristics such as skin or hair color. The child inherits one set of allele's from each parent. Together they form the child's genotype. The child also inherits mitochondria which are outside {{the nucleus of the}} cell. Genes code for the production of proteins which in turn interact with the environment to produce a phenotype. What we refer to as traits or characteristics are the phenotypes. The human being in all his or her complexity is the result of this interaction of a unique genotype with a unique environment. The modern study of heredity began with the rediscovery in 1900 of the work of Gregor Mendel (1822 - 1884) by Hugo De Vries, Karl Correns, and Erich Tschermak. Mendel discovered the basic laws of segregation and independent assortment of paired alleles which opened the way for the modern science of genetics.

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{discuss the}} recent {{literature}} on paternal obesity, {{focusing on the}} possible mechanisms of transmission of the phenotypes from the father to the children. Sources: A non-systematic review in the PubMed database found few publications in which paternal obesity was implicated in the adverse <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> to offspring. Specific articles on epigenetics were also evaluated. As the subject is recent and still controversial, all articles were considered regardless of year of publication. Summary of findings: Studies in humans and animals have established that paternal obesity impairs their hormones, metabolism, and sperm function, which can be transmitted to their offspring. In humans, paternal obesity results in insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and increased levels of cortisol in umbilical cord blood, which increases the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Notably, there is an association between body fat in parents and the prevalence of obesity in their daughters. In animals, paternal obesity led to offspring alterations on glucose-insulin homeostasis, hepatic lipogenesis, hypothalamus/feeding behavior, kidney of the offspring; it also impairs the reproductive potential of male offspring with sperm oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. An explanation for these observations (human and animal) is epigenetics, considered the primary tool for the transmission of phenotypes from the father to offspring, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA. Conclusions: Paternal obesity can induce programmed phenotypes in offspring through epigenetics. Therefore, it {{can be considered a}} public health problem, affecting the children's future life...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Constructing Race and Sexuality track. In “Blood is Thicker than Water: Policing Donor Insemination and the Reproduction of Whiteness,” Seline Szkupinski Quiroga explores the deployment of race in biomedical solutions to infertility. To set the context for this exploration, she attempts to describe the role of race in the American kinship model. According to Quiroga: “Heredity is usually understood simply as the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> and traits from parent to offspring, where the difference between physical expression of genes (phenotype) and the actual inherited genes of the parents (genotype) is obscured. ” One likely source of this obscuring {{is the way in which}} biological heredity and kinship have traditionally been viewed through the metaphor of blood. Metaphors serve as narratives of meaning and help to frame our understanding of the world, but they often bring together a number of ideas and carry with them a number of connotations that we might do well to try to sort out. For instance, the metaphor of blood combines at least two issues that ought to be distinguished – the mechanisms for transmission of genetic variation and the ‘substance’ of hereditary characteristics or traits. In the metaphor, blood is both the carrier and the substance of biological inheritance. The issue is further complicated by at least two other historical features of hereditary thinking in terms of blood. First is the great power and importance frequently attributed to blood/heredity – that is, a persistent tendency toward biological determinism. As Quiroga writes: “Popular aphorisms such as ‘blood will tell’ because ‘like begets like’ reflect the belief that what one inherits from one’s parents is more significant and essential than one’s social environment” (145). Second is the historically strong association between heredity and race, also expressed through blood metaphors. “The metaphor of blood was, and still is, code for race,” Quiroga writes, “with connotations regarding the ‘sanctity of blood, mixing blood, white blood, black blood, and pure versus tainted blood’” (145). The linking of race and heredity is foundational to the American racial hierarchy, which “relies on the idea that intrinsic to whiteness are so-called superior traits that are linked to success” and that those traits are heritable – in other words that “whiteness itself is heritable” (Quiroga 145). In fact, however, “both whiteness and race are social constructions and therefore not heritable” (Quiroga 146). While those phenotypic traits popularly used (typically idiosyncratically) to “discern” a person’s so-called race (e. g. eye shape, facial structure, hair texture, stature, and skin color) are, in fact, heritable, their distributions among world populations do not allow for any genuinely scientific demarcation of the groups any given culture considers to be “racial. ” In other words, while the latest work in genetics can use genetic variation to mark out populations in terms of patterns of migration, ancestry and descent, this work cannot give us scientifically the “races” whose existence has been assumed, constructed and reified socio-historically. Why is it, then, that “the folk idea that race is reducible to biological features remains prevalent” (Quiroga 146) ? Even, one could argue, in the very formulation and execution of so-called scientific inquiry into genetics and heredity? If, as Quiroga asserts, “[t]wenty-first-century hereditarianism substitutes the idea of blood for genes” (146), then one answer may lie in the fact that, rather than taking new scientific information on its own terms (to whatever extent that would be possible), we have to some degree simply pasted updated scientific terminology (genes) onto our old metaphorical understanding of blood, with all its limitations, prejudices and idiosyncrasies. We do not question our biological determinism; we simply make it genetic determinism. We abandon the idea of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ blood only to replace it with ‘good’ or ‘bad’ genes, without interrogating our sense of which ‘groups’ carry and transmit these ‘good’ or ‘bad’ qualities or attempting to complicate our understanding of heredity itself. Today, “genes rather than blood will tell” (Quiroga 146). In this paper, I explore these ideas that (1) the way we talk about genes today is related to the way that we used to talk about blood and that (2) the way we used to talk about blood had not simply to do with ideas of kinship and heredity, but crucially with ideas about race. In an effort both to elaborate upon and fill in Quiroga’s claims, I argue that these three concepts – race, kinship and heredity – were connected and conjoined through the metaphor of blood, forming a messy knot of meaning in which our ‘new’ thinking about genes often remains entangled. To that end, I will begin by discussing blood as a metaphor for heredity, kinship and race. With the aim of illuminating these blood metaphors in the American context, where the idea of blood as a ‘natural substance’ is a primary feature, I will introduce some information about the origin of the terms ‘race’ and ‘heredity’ in the English language before discussing the use of the blood metaphor in race thinking after the end of American chattel slavery. I will then turn to a brief discussion of the role of metaphor in current popular understandings of genetics and consider how the persistence of old metaphors can enable the persistence of certain notions of race in spite of scientific evidence that ought to dismantle them. In the course of these explorations, I also hope to make clear both how prevalent metaphor is in our language and our understanding of the world and how deeply intertwined race thinking and politics have been and remain with our understandings of heredity and kinship in general...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} and modeling <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> parameters <b>of</b> metallic cables under extreme temperatures. Metallic cables are often used in hazardous environments and for many critical applications, in which the fire events can occur, e. g. as signaling cables for temperature and fire sensors etc. These cables usually have special fire resistant and retardant coatings and shielding {{to be able to}} resist longer during extreme temperatures (fire) compared to the standard cables with polymer (PE, PVC) coatings. However, the <b>transmission</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> metallic cables, such as the attenuation and crosstalk, are significantly dependent on the surrounding temperature as well.
