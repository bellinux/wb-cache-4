5|$|<b>The</b> <b>withdrawal</b> method (also {{known as}} coitus interruptus) is the {{practice}} of ending intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main risk of <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal</b> method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner. First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage. It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were too expensive to operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal</b> was the spike in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large part due to <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal</b> process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support {{is the most effective}} way of managing <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|By 21:00, {{heavy rain}} was falling which helped {{disguise}} <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> The heavy bombardment commenced and the units {{began to fall}} back to the river.

The Germans shelled <b>the</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> believing {{it to be a}} resupply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ceased lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately.|$|E
