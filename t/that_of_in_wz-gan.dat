50|$|He {{took the}} degree of LL.D. at the University of Oxford. On the vacancy of the archdiocese <b>of</b> Canterbury <b>in</b> 1500, he became {{commissary}} of the chapter and of the prerogative court.

50|$|He {{graduated}} from Western Reserve College in 1864 and from Andover Theological Seminary in 1869. He was ordained to the Congregational ministry on May 26, 1870. The degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D. or DD, Divinitatis Doctor in Latin) was conferred on him by Western Reserve College in 1879; Yale University <b>that</b> <b>of</b> M.A. <b>in</b> 1881, Western Reserve College <b>that</b> <b>of</b> LL.D. <b>in</b> 1895, and Princeton University <b>that</b> <b>of</b> LL.D. <b>in</b> 1896.|$|R
30|$|A {{comparison}} of diffusion coefficients <b>of</b> natural gas <b>in</b> foamy oil, saturated oil, and dead oil {{at the same}} pressure indicates <b>that</b> diffusion coefficients <b>of</b> natural gas <b>in</b> foamy oil are lower than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> gas <b>in</b> saturated oil and dead oil. For example, the diffusion coefficients <b>of</b> natural gas <b>in</b> dead oil are 3.02 and 4.02 times than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> gas <b>in</b> saturated oil and foamy oil when the pressure is 20  MPa. This is the reason why the cumulative diffusion volume <b>of</b> gas <b>in</b> dead oil is larger than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> gas <b>in</b> saturated oil and foamy oil.|$|R
