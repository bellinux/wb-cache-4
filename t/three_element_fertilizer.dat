This recycled carbonaceous material (CRDF) has two major good points: 1) rich in the <b>three</b> chemical <b>elements</b> of <b>fertilizer</b> (nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potassium) and 2) a good adsorbent like activated charcoal. In this study, making {{the best use of}} these merits, we looked into the possibility of using this material to restore seaweed forests that were damaged by human activities. We confirmed that no toxic substance was liquated out from this material. In the laboratory experiments, the growth of a species of marine green algae (Derbesia tenuissima (Moris et De Notaris) Crouan) was accelerated by this material. CRDF might supply nitrogen short in seawater as the form of nitrate. Our technique was actually effective to introduce marine algae in the fields using a series of test plates that included this material ranging from 0 to 8. 2 % (w/w). We might not only recover biodiversity in coastal ecosystems by restoring seaweed forests but also remarkably reduce atmospheric CO 2 released in the process of the incineration of waste with this technique...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A two-years {{field trial}} was {{initiated}} on 20 / 9 / 93 {{to assess the}} effect of eight (23) fertilizer treatments comprising two levels (zero and 50 kg ha– 1) {{of each of the}} <b>three</b> major <b>fertilizer</b> <b>elements</b> (N, P and K) on vegetative growth of a heterogenous jojoba population established on 28 / 2 / 93. Data taken on nine morphological traits for eight consecutive seasons (Fall 1993 up to Summer 1995) revealed high significant differences among seasons for each of the studied traits. In addition, main effects of N, P and K on morphological traits were generally absent and when present (1 st and 8 th seasons) they were all negative, with the exception of branch length (winter 1993) that was pos-itively increased by N application. Effect of N 1 P 0 and N 0 P 1 on number of branches (3 out of 8 seasons), N 1 P 1 on leaf area and leaf weight (Fall 1993) and of P 0 K 0 and P 1 K 1 on plant height and number of branches (Summer 1995), on the other hand, were all positive and significant. Among second or-der interactions, effects of N 1 P 1 K 1 and N 1 P 1 K 0 on leaf area and Specific Leave Area (SLA) (1 st and 3 rd seasons) were the highest, but were statistically similar to those of N 0 P 0 K 0. Application of N had also significantly increased N content (fall, winter and spring) and P content (summer) of Jojoba leaves in the first year...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} {{suggested}} {{the use of}} the screen layout elements of balance, unity, and sequence {{as a part of a}} computational model of interface aesthetics. It is argued that these <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> are the most contributed terms in the model. In the current study, a controlled experiment was designed and conducted to systematically investigate effects of these <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> (balance, unity, and sequence) on the perceived interface aesthetics. Results showed that the <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> have significant effects on the perceived interface aesthetics. Significant interactions were also found among the <b>three</b> <b>elements.</b> A regression model relating the perceived visual aesthetics to the <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> was constructed. When validating the model using standard questionnaire scores of real web pages, high correlations were found between the values computed by the model and scores of questionnaire items related to visual layout of the web pages, indicating that layout-based measures are good at assessing the classical dimension of website aesthetics...|$|R

The main innovation of this method is the use of ICA methods based on <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> to define the graphic, the independent graphic function code, the parent element and the selection principle and to divide the image according to the characteristics of the <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> without the precise analysis of the color, texture and geometric shapes of the image.

40|$|Abstract—Multiplication of <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> over finite fields is used {{extensively}} in multivariate {{public key cryptography}} and solving system of linear equations over finite fields. This contribution shows the enhancements of multiplication of <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> over finite fields by using specific architecture. We firstly propose a versatile multi-input multiplier over finite fields. The parameters of this multiplier can be changed according to the requirement of the users which makes it reusable in different applications. Our evaluation of this multiplier gives optimum choices for multiplication of <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> over finite fields. Implemented results show that we takes 22. 062 ns and 16. 354 ns to execute each multiplication of <b>three</b> <b>elements</b> over GF ((24) 2) based on table look-up and polynomial basis on a FPGA respectively. Experimental results and mathematical proofs clearly demonstrate {{the improvement of the}} proposed versatile multiplier over finite fields...|$|R
