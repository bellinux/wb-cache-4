5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to <b>the</b> <b>experimenter</b> after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4).

Interestingly, some participants deceived <b>the</b> <b>experimenter</b> by pretending to continue the experiment.

Under that condition, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine whether}} a host’s single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Vif-associated APOBEC 3 G Proteasomal Complex influence his/her innate immunity to Human Immunodeficiency Virus- 1. <b>The</b> <b>experimenters</b> compared host DNA at specific sites on each patient’s genome (SNPs) and the patient’s HIV- 1 disease progression.

25|$|A {{primary source}} has {{reported}} a functional neuroimaging experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an experimenter performing constructions with small objects and while <b>the</b> <b>experimenter,</b> while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' {{sense of ownership}} (the sense that it is I who am experiencing the movement or thought) {{as well as the}} visual and somatosensory inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a control condition (in which subjects acted differently from <b>the</b> <b>experimenter),</b> namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|Outside-out {{patching}} gives <b>the</b> <b>experimenter</b> {{the opportunity}} to examine the properties of an ion channel when it is isolated from the cell and exposed successively to different solutions on the extracellular surface of the membrane. <b>The</b> <b>experimenter</b> can perfuse the same patch {{with a variety of}} solutions in a relatively short amount of time, and if the channel is activated by a neurotransmitter or drug from the extracellular face, a dose-response curve can then be obtained. This ability to measure current through exactly the same piece of membrane in different solutions is the distinct advantage of the outside-out patch relative to the cell-attached method. On the other hand, it is more difficult to accomplish. The longer formation process involves more steps that could fail and results in a lower frequency of usable patches.|$|E
25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by <b>the</b> <b>experimenter,</b> while {{the participant was}} led to believe they were entirely self-conducted. <b>The</b> <b>experimenter</b> stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones {{they were more likely to}} say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the maintenance of social norms is also revealed in the emotional reactions felt by <b>the</b> <b>experimenters.</b> Most of <b>the</b> <b>experimenters</b> reported great difficulty in carrying out the task. They reported that, when {{standing in front of the}} subject, they felt anxious, tense, and embarrassed. Many felt unable to verbalize the request for a seat and had to withdraw. They sometimes feared they were the center of attention in the car and were often unable to look directly at the subjects. Once they made a successful request for a seat, they felt pressure to act in a way that would actually justify the request, such as pretending to be ill. Milgram proposes that <b>the</b> <b>experimenters</b> were playing <b>the</b> social role of subway rider, and they felt an extreme emotional reaction as a result of breaking implicit rules for that role.

25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session.

This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGaze following, {{the ability}} to follow the gaze of other individuals, has been widely studied in {{non-human}} primate species, mostly in adult individuals. Yet, the literature on gaze following revealed a quite variability across the different findings, some of it might reflect true inter-species differences, while others {{might be related to}} methodological differences, or to an underestimation of the factors involved in the expression of gaze following. In the current study, we tested 54 captive olive baboons (Papio anubis), housed in social groups, to assess how juvenile and adult baboons would spontaneously react to a sudden change {{in the direction of a}} human experimenter's head. First, our results showed that juveniles, more than adult baboons, co-oriented their gaze with <b>the</b> <b>experimenter's</b> gaze.
