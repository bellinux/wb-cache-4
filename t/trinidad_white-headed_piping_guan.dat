5000|$|Instead of a species, the blue-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} two subspecies of Pipile pipile, a name that is here restricted to the Trinidad <b>piping</b> <b>guan.</b> Authorities disagree, as does recent evidence. A genetic study suggests a split, but free interbreeding between this species (grayi) and the red-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> in eastern Bolivia, creating a [...] "hybrid swarm", suggests a lump.|$|R
50|$|No other <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> {{is found}} in its range, though the Gray's <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> (Pipile cumanensis grayi) {{approaches}} it in Paraguay. This bird has a pale bluish pendulous wattle, a smaller wing patch, and an entirely naked white face and white forehead.|$|R
25|$|Other {{endangered}} species include the jaguar (Panthera onca) and the black-fronted <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> (Pipile jacutinga).|$|R
50|$|Thus {{it appears}} most {{likely that the}} present genus diverged in the eastern foothills of the Andes somewhere in the {{vicinity}} of Bolivia, far to the northwest from where its origin would be presumed from the phylogeny and present-day distribution of Pipile alone (Pereira et al. 2002, Grau et al. 2005). Two considerations are worthy of note: First, the time at which the ancestor of the <b>piping</b> <b>guans</b> diverged from Penelope has been roughly dated to the Burdigalian, some 20-15 mya, which leaves a considerable gap during which no surviving <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> lineage evolved (Pereira et al. 2002). Secondly, it is notable that in the Late Pliocene, rising sea levels transformed much of the South American lowlands into brackish lagoon habitat unsuitable for <b>piping</b> <b>guans.</b> Thus, the present distribution is apparently a relict, and extinction of populations/displacement by the more resilient Penelope guans seems to have played as much or possibly more of a role in shaping the diversity of <b>piping</b> <b>guans</b> of our time than emergence of new lineages (Grau et al. 2005).|$|R
50|$|The blue-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> (Pipile cumanensis) is a South American bird of {{the family}} Cracidae that is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance to the turkey.|$|R
50|$|The <b>piping</b> <b>guans</b> are a bird genus, Pipile, in the Cracidae family. A {{recent study}} (Grau et al. 2005), {{evaluating}} mtDNA, osteology and biogeography data (Grau et al., 2005) {{concluding that the}} wattled guan belongs in the same genus as these and is a hypermelanistic <b>piping</b> <b>guan.</b> Thus, Pipile became a junior synonym of Aburria, though this conclusion was not accepted by the South American Checklist Committee (Remsen et al., 2007), or evaluated by the IOC, so the classification remains in Pipile.|$|R
25|$|Birds include toucans, pionus parrots, Brazilian tanager (Ramphocelus bresilius), {{solitary tinamou}} (Tinamus solitarius), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus), penelopes and black-fronted <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> (Pipile jacutinga).|$|R
50|$|The red-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> (Pipile cujubi) is {{a species}} of bird in the Cracidae family. It is found in northeastern Bolivia and Brazil, where its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests.|$|R
5000|$|Data {{confirms}} that the other blue-wattled species, the blue-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan,</b> is the Trinidad species' closest living relative. Interestingly, the same data suggests that these diverged some 400.000 years ago at latest, perhaps as early as 1.6 mya, whereas Trinidad has been an island only {{since the end of}} the last ice age. This indicates that the Trinidad <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> evolved in mainland South America, being driven to its relict island range in more recent times. The holotype of this species was supposedly collected in the [...] "Orinoco River region near Cumaná" [...] (del Hoyo 1994a,b). This locality has usually been considered erroneous. However, as it indicates an area on the mainland roughly opposite Trinidad, it might actually be correct and indicate that the Trinidad <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> was not extirpated from Venezuela until around 1800. In South America, the form cumanensis has a greenish gloss to the plumage, a white face and crest, and a blue wattle, cujubi has a blue face and a red wattle, and [...] jacutinga has a black face and a red wattle." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Trinidad <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> (Pipile pipile) locally {{known as}} the pawi, is a bird in the chachalaca, guan and curassow family Cracidae, endemic to the island of Trinidad. It is a large bird, {{somewhat}} resembling a turkey in appearance, and {{research has shown that}} its nearest living relative is the blue-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> from South America. It is a mainly arboreal species feeding mostly on fruit, but also on flowers and leaves. At one time abundant, it has declined in numbers and been extirpated from much of its natural range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird as [...] "critically endangered".|$|R

50|$|The chachalacas, guans and {{curassows}} are {{birds in}} the family Cracidae. These are species of tropical and subtropical Central and South America. One species, the plain chachalaca, just reaches southernmost Texas in the USA. Two species, the Trinidad <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> and the rufous-vented chachalaca occur on the islands of Trinidad and Tobago respectively.|$|R
50|$|It was {{possible}} to confidently resolve that the white-faced species form a clade, whereas the more basal black-faced forms are of less certain relationship. Possibly, the black-fronted <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> is the basalmost taxon, but {{the placement of the}} wattled guan in regard to its congeners is not all too well resolved. Blue wattles evolved only once, in a lineage which seems to have originated north of the Amazon River. The piping guans' radiation began {{in the latter half of}} the Early Pliocene, roughly 4-3.5 mya. The white-faced lineage emerged around 3 mya and its present diversity began to evolve around the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary, when the ancestors of the red-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> and the blue-wattled taxa split. Due to not being calibrated by material evidence such as fossils, the divergence times cannot be estimated with a high confidence (Grau et al. 2005).|$|R

50|$|The Cujubim Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) {{takes its}} name from the Blue-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> (Aburria cumanensis), locally called the Cujubim and a common bird in the region.The reserve is in the {{municipality}} of Jutaí, Amazonas and has an area of 2450380 ha.It is the largest conservation unit in Amazonas and the largest sustainable development reserve in the world.It lies along the Jutaí River, a tributary of the Solimões River that flows in a northeast direction {{to the west of the}} Juruá River.The conservation unit also contains the Biá and Mutum rivers, tributaries of the Jutaí.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the genus was {{possibly}} in the general area of eastern Bolivia, at the very margin of its current range. From the phylogeny outlined above, the <b>piping</b> <b>guans</b> {{would be expected to}} have originated in the southern Brazilian lowlands. However, although the relationships of the genera of guans are not entirely clear, it seems most likely that the group originated in the northern Andes region: The northernmost guan genera Chamaepetes and Penelopina appear to be basal divergences, and Pipile is most likely closer to Penelope (which represents a generally southward radiation out of the northern Andes) than to these.|$|R
50|$|There are two subspecies—P. c. cumanensis and P. c. grayi. P. c. cumanensis (Jacquin, 1784) {{is found}} from the Guyanas, the Orinoco river in Venezuela, and southeastern Colombia south to northwestern (Amazonian) Brazil and southeastern Peru. There and {{possibly}} in northern Bolivia it intergrades with the bigger P. c. grayi (Pelzeln, 1870) (Gray's <b>piping</b> <b>guan),</b> which continues through northern and central Bolivia, Mato Grosso (state of Brazil), and northern and eastern Paraguay. This species occurs locally in forests: in Colombia and Venezuela, humid lowland forests (occasionally {{as high as}} 1000 m) whether seasonally flooded or not, and riparian forests. It especially favors the edges where the forest meets open land or a river.|$|R
2500|$|The {{greatest}} threat to igapó forests is the construction of hydroelectric dams on tributaries of the Amazon river; when constructed, the dams will divert huge amounts of water and dramatically change the hydrology of the Amazon basin and its ecosystems. Because many flora within seasonally inundated forests are highly adapted to a particular flooding schedule, alterations in flood patterns {{and the creation of}} permanently flooded areas will induce higher rates of tree mortality. The loss of these trees will likely affect populations of frugivorous understory birds, such as the blue-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> and some Amazona parrots that are restricted to igapó. Loss of habitat will cause migrations of species that will inevitably lead to higher competition in unaffected habitats and possibly local extinctions.|$|R
25|$|In the Caribbean 600 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} of which 163 are endemic such as the tody, Fernandina's flicker and palmchat. The American yellow warbler is found in many areas as is the green heron. Of the endemic species 48 are threatened with extinction including the Puerto Rican amazon, yellow-breasted crake and the Zapata wren. According to Birdlife International in 2006 in Cuba 29 species of bird {{are in danger of}} extinction and two species officially extinct. The black-fronted <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> is endangered as is the plain pigeon. The Antilles along with Central America lie in the flight path of migrating birds from North America so the size of populations is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the forests are found parrots, bananaquit and toucans. Over the open sea can be seen frigatebirds and tropicbirds.|$|R
5000|$|The blue-throated <b>piping</b> <b>guan</b> is {{described}} as [...] "oddly 'prehistoric' (reptilian)" [...] but [...] "handsome". It averages 69 cm long, including its neck and tail, both long, the neck and head disproportionately thin and small, the tail disproportionately big. Most of the plumage is black with a greenish gloss—blue-green in cumanensis, olive in grayi. It has a large white patch on each wing, white flecks on the wing coverts and chest, a white patch over the eye, and a white or buffy-white nape (and upper neck in grayi). Both subspecies have a short white or buffy-white crest; in cumanensis it is shaggy and nearly solid-colored; in grayi it is hairier, and the feather shafts are black, appearing as streaks. The bill is baby-blue at the base and cobalt-blue at the tip. Both subspecies have blue bare flesh on the throat with a wattle in cumanensis and a hanging caruncle in grayi. The legs are red.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{very active}} {{tradition}} of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago. Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided {{by the use of}} hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting permits in recent years (in a very small country of {{about the size of the}} state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad <b>piping</b> <b>guans</b> and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.|$|R
