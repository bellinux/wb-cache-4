25|$|In C. lectularius, males {{sometimes}} mount other males because male {{sexual interest}} {{is directed at}} any recently fed individual regardless of their sex, but unfed females may also be mounted. Traumatic insemination {{is the only way}} for copulation to occur in bed bugs. Females have evolved the spermalege to protect themselves from wounding and infection. Because males lack this organ, traumatic insemination could leave them badly injured. For this reason, males have evolved alarm pheromones to signal their sex to other males. If a male C. lectularius mounts another male, the mounted male releases the pheromone signal and the male on <b>top</b> <b>stops</b> before insemination.|$|R

50|$|Many methods, which differ {{according}} to different regions, exist {{to stop a}} woman from turning into a Churel.

40|$|Supersymmetric {{partners}} {{of the top}} quark have been sought since the top quark has been discovered at the Tevatron. The searches are more easily performed in scenarios where the mass splitting between the <b>top</b> and the <b>stop</b> is large and where differences in kinematics are striking. The region in which <b>top</b> and <b>stop</b> are almost degenerate in mass {{is more difficult to}} explore experimentally as the final state kinematics are very similar, apart from angular-related distributions which reflect the spin/parity difference between the two particles. Usually the searches are performed looking for deviations on the measured top-quark pair production cross section with respect to the standard model prediction, or looking to simple variables such as the difference in the azimuthal angle between two leptons produced after top quark decays...|$|R
