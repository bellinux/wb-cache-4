5000|$|As {{one of his}} publications, Corvisart's {{translation}} of Leopold Auenbrugger's Inventum novum in 1808 further expanded the field of auscultation through providing a text for physicians to learn how <b>to</b> <b>percuss</b> patients' chests for diagnostic purposes. His commentary on Auenbrugger's original text extended its length four times. This method of percussion had a resurgence under Corvisart's translation and became an intrinsic aspect of clinical medicine. In particular, Corvisart attentively focused on the heart and lungs as sources of lesions. His studies with these lesions led to him percussing the chest of his patients to find such wounds inside the body, studying the [...] "organic diseases of the heart". Corvisart is also linked to Reneé Laennec, the physician who invented the stethoscope for auscultation several years later. Laennec learned of percussion from Corvisart's {{translation of}} Auenbrugger's book. Corvisart, Laennec and others also headed the so-called [...] "Paris school" [...] that developed new methods of medicine in the twenty hospitals of Paris. By establishing a monetary clinical teaching school at Hôpital de la Charité, Corvisart and his peers codified a current institution of medical training.|$|E
40|$|A good {{understanding}} of human anatomy is clinically relevant for many health care professionals. A detailed knowledge of where, as well as how, <b>to</b> palpate, <b>percuss</b> or auscultate is essential for adequate assessment, provision of treatment and ongoing care of patients. Thus, the linking of human anatomy and clinical assessment is essential. However, Australian nursing students are often excluded from experiences, such as exposure to cadaveric material, which might enable them to gain a good working knowledge of internal human anatomy. Herein systematic student feedback from nursing students who were provided with a single exposure to prosected human anatomical material {{and were able to}} manipulate and interact with that material is presented, {{in the context of the}} integrative educational aims and goals of this learning and teaching activity. Thus, this study aims to add to the literature informing ongoing dialog regarding the best set of tools to teach anatomy to students of nursing.

50|$|Since {{indirect}} percussion {{can be so}} precisely placed, {{the platform}} is often much smaller on flakes produced in this way than in other methods of flake removal. Of course, indirect percussion requires two hands <b>to</b> hold the <b>percussing</b> tool set. One holds the hammer, and one holds the punch. Therefore, modern hobbyists must use a third object in order to hold the targeted piece of tool stone while they strike it. Often, some sort of clamp or vise is used. No evidence for such devices has yet {{been found in the}} archaeological record, but this is partly because they would normally be made of perishable materials, and partly because they can have great variation in design.|$|R
40|$|Distance {{perception}} {{by hitting}} with a holding stick is quite {{important for the}} people with visual impairments who daily use white cane. If the mechanism of this perception is well understood, it can be applied {{for the development of}} more intuitive and simple electric white cane consisting of a range sensor and a haptic display. A hypothetical mechanical model of a stick and a holding palm told us that hitting at a closer point should induce a stronger vibration at thumb side of the palm, and percussing a farther point should induce equally distributed vibrations in the palm. To verify if this vibration distribution plays role in the distance perception, we conducted an experiment that superimpose vibration to the real vibration while <b>percussing,</b> <b>to</b> change the center of gravity of vibration. The experimental results showed that adding vibration to the thumb side shortened the perceived collision distance than adding vibration to the little-finger side, which partly agrees with our hypothetical model.
