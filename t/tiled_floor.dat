5|$|In {{the centre}} {{room of the}} {{transept}} there is a low slate slab altar stone, with an etched red Chi-Ro emblem, with Alpha and Omega incised. A Chi-ro is an early form of Christogram, and is formed by the super imposition {{of the first two}} letters of the Greek alphabet onto a circle. There is a rough Cornish granite monolith seat and prie-dieu, which with the altar stone are inset with gold-enamelled small tiles by Andrew Rowe. The wall plaster has an incised red line. There is a white glazed <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> with red tile border around the two early Celtic crosses. In the south wall above the stone crosses are 1920s/1930s windows representing Saints Padarn, Dewi and (in the centre and above) Teilo. The Padarn window is a single-light window with a standing figure of St Padarn holding a staff and chalice, with a valley and hills behind him. It was given in memory of members of the Bonsall family, and was made by the Heaton, Butler & Bayne, London, around 1930, thus preceding Peter Lord's work on the transept.|$|E
5|$|Though Cleeve was by {{no means}} a wealthy house, the monks were able to make {{significant}} investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period. In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome tiled floors (an expensive and high status product) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken. A wooden shelter was constructed over the <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> in 2016. Abbot David Juyner (r.1435–87) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery. He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor. This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling (carved with angels) was the equal of the hall of any contemporary secular lord. Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments. These were probably used by corrodians, pensioners of the abbey. Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects. Some of these wall paintings survive. As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and the man has an angel on either side of his head, and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right. Work continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution. The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion. As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.|$|E
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} a large square room with recent ceramic tile floor and {{fittings}} s. Storerooms with rendered walls and <b>tiled</b> <b>floors</b> lead off under a wide-arched opening. The scullery in the northeast corner is of painted brickwork and hardboard ceiling, with recent mosaic <b>tiled</b> <b>floors.</b> The WC, between scullery and eastern entrance, has rendered walls.|$|R
50|$|Like many recent {{government}} {{buildings in the}} Philippines they usually have concrete block walls, galvanized iron roofs, and <b>tiled</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1934 to 1935, Father Morice Van Overbergh {{installed}} the <b>tiled</b> <b>floors</b> on the church. He was a scholar and did outstanding work in botany, anthropology and linguistics.|$|R
25|$|Much of the {{interior}} trim is original, such as <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> and wainscoting in turquoise and black, cream enameled walls, a laminated counter with 16 stools and a back wall with ribbed metal covering for all the kitchen functions. These treatments are more utilitarian, more typical of a lunch counter than a lushly-furnished rail diner of the era. The rear wing has some open dining space with freestanding tables and chairs, plus restrooms with their original doors.|$|E
25|$|Experts {{attribute}} symbols {{to various}} aspects of the painting. A number of the items, a plaster mask, perhaps representing the debate on paragone, the presence of a piece of cloth, a folio, and some leather on the table have been linked to the symbols of Liberal Arts. The representation of the marble <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> and the splendid golden chandelier are examples of Vermeer's craftsmanship and show his knowledge of perspective. Each object reflects or absorbs light differently, getting the most accurate rendering of material effects.|$|E
25|$|Pictures of the House were {{released}} on 24 May 2005, revealing the outdoor shower and pool. There is {{a row of}} three outdoor showers that replace {{the need for a}} complete bathroom; a sink and toilet are inside despite having an outdoor sink. The <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> leads onto the wooden deck of the pool, this year a circular pool positioned {{in a corner of the}} garden. The other side of the showers leads towards the slightly elevated glass-box lounge that originally had mult-levelled green couches but were eventually replaced with low orange ones.|$|E

50|$|The interiors, {{while not}} a strict {{reproduction}} of authentic Tuder style, contained many natural materials like stone and timbers. Other design elements included <b>tiled</b> <b>floors,</b> carved stone fireplaces, and stained glass medallions in the windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} hosts smooth mosaic <b>tiled</b> <b>floors,</b> recently lowered {{ceilings and}} ornate steel staircases. The interior hosts four levels, {{one of which}} is underground. A renovation updated many features in the courthouse, such as wiring, heating and cooling and several decorative pieces.|$|R
25|$|Antonello da Messina painted mostly small meticulous {{portraits in}} glowing colours. But {{one of his}} most famous works also {{demonstrates}} his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. This is the small painting of St. Jerome in His Study, in which the composition is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the <b>tiled</b> <b>floor.</b> The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural light and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited Piero della Francesca. Antonello's work influenced both Gentile Bellini, who did a series of paintings of Miracles of Venice for the Scuola di Santa Croce, and his more famous brother, Giovanni, {{one of the most significant}} painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy.|$|E
500|$|The chancel, {{according}} to Hall, contains [...] "artistic {{work of a}} kind seldom seen anywhere". [...] The raised <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> of the chancel curves outward {{into the body of}} the church, and is approached by seven marble steps. The sanctuary is raised further, and enclosed by a marble altar rail behind which is an altar carved from white Carrara marble by L.M. Avenali. [...] The altar supports a [...] "simple unadorned brass cross that reflects the colors of the mosaics surrounding it." [...] The cross was made by William van Erp and was dedicated to the memory of Jane Stanford in 1948.|$|E
500|$|The {{entrance}} hall is [...] with a <b>tiled</b> <b>floor.</b> The reception room {{is located on}} the right-hand side of the {{entrance hall}}. A moulded archway leads to the staircase hall, with the stairs being at right angles to the entrance doors. Rooms and areas that can be accessed from this hallway include the cellar, a sitting room which is [...] in size, a children's study room that is [...] by 6 metres and a children's refectory that is [...] by 6 metres. A back door leads to verandahs that are found {{at the back of the}} building that allow access to various other rooms. A second staircase, surrounded by brick walls, can act as an escape route in case of a fire. The staircase floor is the colour of cement and is made out of hardwood with iron risers. The staircase also provides access to the chapel room, which is [...] by 6 metres.|$|E
5000|$|The camp has a {{total of}} three large camper {{bathrooms}} in addition to several other smaller private bathrooms. The largest, and by far nicest, bathroom on camp is the [...] "Bijou". It was recently redone with six toilets, four urinals, and new <b>tiled</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Being three storeys high, {{the arcade}} has the traditional-styled {{protruding}} galleries, cedar staircases, <b>tiled</b> <b>floors,</b> cast iron balusters and timber framed shop fronts, under a prominent, tinted glass roof to reduce glare. The arcade contains the preliminary boutiques {{that characterized the}} Sydney shopping experience of the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} of stone masonry and mortar primarily, plastered and whitewashed, with the portal and secondary elements in stone. In addition, {{the elements of}} the church include tile covering of straw, wood-lined ceilings with dome plastered and whitewashed, <b>tiled</b> <b>floors,</b> wooden window frames, gilded altarpiece and polychromatic tiles.|$|R
500|$|The archaeological remains are {{recognised}} as a GradeI {{listed building}} and a scheduled ancient monument, and {{are considered to}} be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire. [...] They consist of the former undercroft and the foundations of the church and monastic buildings that were exposed during the excavations. The undercroft stands outside the museum building. It is a single-storey structure consisting of seven pairs of bays divided into two compartments, one of four and the other of three bays. It is entered through the portico added to the west front of the country house in 1886 by way of a pair of arched doorways in Norman style. The doorway to the right (south) is original, dating from the late 12thcentury, while the other doorway is a replica dated 1886. The older doorway has been described as [...] "the finest decorated Norman doorway in Cheshire". It is in good condition with little evidence of erosion and Greene considers that this is because it has always been protected from the weather. The portico leads into the four-bay compartment. This has a <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> and contains a medieval-style fireplace. The roof is ribbed vaulted. On the east wall is a two-arched doorway leading to the former cloisters. To the north another archway leads to the three-bay compartment. This also has a tile floor and contains the brick wine bins added in the 1780s. The roof of this compartment has groined vaults. The undercroft also contains a bell mould, reconstructed from the fragments of the original mould found in the excavations.|$|E
500|$|The {{events in}} 1536 {{surrounding}} {{the fate of}} the abbey at the dissolution of the monasteries are complicated, and included a dispute between SirPiers Dutton, who was in a powerful position as the Sheriff of Cheshire, and SirWilliam Brereton, the deputy-chamberlain of Chester. Dutton's estate was next to that of the abbey, and Dutton plotted to gain some of its land from the Crown after the dissolution; while Brereton supported the abbot against Dutton and held the lucrative position of steward of the abbey. A campaign of vilification was directed at the canons, asserting that they were guilty of [...] "debauched conduct". Then, in 1535, Dutton falsely accused the abbot and Brereton of issuing counterfeit coins. This charge was dismissed mainly because one of Dutton's witnesses was considered to be [...] "unconvincing". Playing into Duttons' hands was the gross undervaluation of the abbey's assets as reported to the royal commissioners of the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535; as a result of which the net annual income of the abbey was recorded, falsely, as falling below the £200 threshold that would subsequently be chosen for the first round of dissolutions in 1536, although whether this subterfuge was due to the machinations of Dutton or the abbot (or both) remains unclear. Brereton and the abbot appear to have attempted to have the dissolution cancelled subject to the payment of a fine, {{as was the case in}} large numbers of other houses in similar circumstances; but in the abbot's absence dissolution commissioners arrived unananounced at the abbey in early October 1536. There was considerable opposition, the commissioners being menaced by around 300local people; for whom the abbot, rushing back, threw an impromptu feast complete with roasted ox. According to Dutton's account, after barricading themselves in a tower the commissioners managed to send a letter to Dutton, who arrived with a force of men in the middle of the night. Most of the rioters fled, but Dutton arrested the abbot and four of the canons, who were sent to Halton Castle and then to prison in Chester. Dutton sent a report of the events to HenryVIII; who demanded that if the abbot and canons had behaved as Dutton reported, they should be immediately executed as traitors. [...] However, because the kings instructions had been conveyed by the Lord Chancellor in the form of letters to both Dutton and Brereton, the two faction leaders would be required to act together to effect them; with the consequence that Brereton was temporarily able to stall any such action by refusing to meet with Dutton. [...] Events elsewhere in the country further delayed the execution and, following an intercession to Thomas Cromwell (whose own informal contacts had cast doubt on the reliability of Dutton's reports), the abbot and canons were discharged and awarded pensions. The abbey was made uninhabitable, the lead from the roof, the bell metal, and other valuable materials were confiscated for the king, and the building lay empty for nine years. The estate came into the ownership of the Crown, and it was managed by Brereton. From the evidence of damage to the <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> of the church, Brown and Howard-Davis conclude it is likely that the church was demolished at an early stage, but otherwise the archaeological evidence for this period is sparse and largely negative.|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the High Church ritual, Carr Smith had the {{interior}} of the church transformed by the architect John H. Buckeridge. Box pews and galleries were removed. An eastern apse and raised chancel were created at the eastern end, with an ornately <b>tiled</b> <b>floor,</b> and brass enclosure. The visual focus of the building, and the focus of the liturgy changed from the pulpit to the communion table and the sacrament of the Eucharist. In reference to the discussions about the changes, Carr Smith is quoted as saying: ...|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s the {{courthouse}} underwent an extensive $3 million restoration. The brass railings {{to both the}} second and third floors are original to the structure, as well as the brass medallions below the bannisters. Also the ornately <b>tiled</b> <b>floors,</b> floral motif stained glass, and the imposing early Victorian woodwork is original.|$|R
50|$|Houses in {{this village}} is not all {{concrete}} and paint rather it has stone walls painted in chunnambu and wood roofs lined with odutiles. The floors are again mostly challiof sand and ground stones which are wiped with Chaani dung water. Lately people are building modern houses with concrete roofs and <b>tiled</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The largest {{works to}} date that {{required}} the Congregation to worship at the nearby Lansdowne Parish Church from October 2000 to March 2002. Work included the provision a new glazed porch, new <b>tiled</b> <b>flooring</b> to replace the temporary flooring from previous phase, completion of the Gywneth Leech decorations and a new lighting scheme.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the building is in 1192, when a priest was murdered in the church. [...] The present church {{was built in the}} 12thcentury; initially it was a simple building consisting of a nave and chancel. [...] During the following century the west tower was added in Early English style, with a pyramidal roof, and the south porch was built. [...] In the 14thcentury the chancel was refurbished in Decorated style. [...] The south transept, known as the Leigh aisle, was added as a chantry chapel in a more flamboyant architectural style {{than the rest of the}} church. [...] A bellcote was built on the east end of the nave roof. [...] During the following century the pyramidal roof was removed from the tower, and battlements, pinnacles and gargoyles were added to it. [...] The windows in the nave were built; they are in Perpendicular style. [...] Towards the end of that century, or during the following century, a <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> was constructed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} was created [...] between 1548 and 1549 {{and was a}} companion piece to Tintoretto's Last Supper, which still hangs at San Marcuola. Christ and St. Peter are at the far right of the image, an unusual position as Christ was typically placed in the centre of any paintings. This is explained by its original positioning in the church {{on the right side}} of the altar. Viewing the painting from a side angle allows the perspective of the <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> and the gaze of the disciples towards Jesus to emphasise his status as the main subject of the painting. On the far left of the painting is Judas Iscariot, clothed in bright red and noticeably isolated from the other figures of the painting. In the middle of the work are the rest of the disciples gathered around the table that was the site of the supper. They are depicted somewhat humorously as they strive to pull off their stockings. In the background there is a portal above Jesus that opens up to a room where the last supper takes place. The opening to the left shows buildings with elaborate and fantastic architecture. The architecture is based closely on designs by Sebastiano Serlio.|$|E
2500|$|From the outset, Thomas {{wished to}} see a <b>tiled</b> <b>floor</b> in the Dorothy Vernon Room. While she {{originally}} asked Mercer to use octagonal tiles interspersed with small square ones, upon which de Forest would stencil additional designs, she settled on the same small square tiles {{that were used in}} the Thomas Library. The additional stenciling was never applied as planned, as Mercer feared that the large quantity of traffic in the room would quickly destroy the stenciling, as had happened in the Deanery's dining room. Four larger tiles with Old English designs were incorporated to differentiate this design from others on campus. For the Deanery vestibule, Thomas requested that Mercer create a new design that he had not used on campus in the other buildings. In a letter to Mercer from 1908, Thomas rejected the diagonal pattern that Mercer created, on account of her dislike of diagonals for being [...] "unrestful." [...] In response, Mercer created a straight pattern that consisted of alternating plain square tiles and square tiles stamped with the letters THO-MAS. which were inspired by a 14th-century British tile design. In addition to the floors in these two public spaces, Mercer's tiles were also used in the fireplace in Mary Garrett's bedroom. In her correspondence with Mercer from 1908, Thomas asked Mercer his advice on what sort of tile would be most useful and pretty for such a project, referencing a fireplace that Mercer had similarly decorated.|$|E
25|$|Another eating {{area was}} the Dutch Room (or German Grill). It was {{noted for its}} {{enormous}} red brick supports which supported the heavy-beamed and paneled ceilings. The room was furnished with wooden and leather chairs and had blue tiled walls and terra cotta <b>tiled</b> <b>floors.</b> It was here that electric grilling started in Chicago.|$|R
25|$|The Ramla Museum {{is housed}} in the former {{municipal}} headquarters of the British Mandatory authorities. The building, from 1922, incorporates elements of Arab architecture such as arched windows and patterned <b>tiled</b> <b>floors.</b> After 1948, it was the central district office of the Israeli Ministry of Finance. In 2001, the building became a museum documenting the history of Ramla.|$|R
50|$|The chancel {{and west}} end of the nave have encaustic <b>tiled</b> <b>floors</b> by Minton. The {{octagonal}} wood panelled pulpit wraps round the northern crossing pier, it has stone base and a wrought iron rail to the stairs. The nave seating, canopied civic stalls and choir stalls are original. Three misericords were saved from the 15th-century church.|$|R
