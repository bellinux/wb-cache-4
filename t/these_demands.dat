5|$|The State Stud of the Hungarian Royal and Imperial Court, Mezőhegyes, {{was founded}} in 1784 to help meet the demand for horses. At the time, Hungary was home to 1.5 million horses, with the Hungarian cavalry {{requiring}} between 10,000 and 15,000 new mounts per year. Different horses fulfilled different roles: courtiers and aristocrats wanted agile, responsive, impressive riding horses for their military endeavors, resilient mounts for hunting on horseback, and elegant carriage horses. Fulfilling <b>these</b> <b>demands</b> led Mezőhegyes to develop several different breeds and strains: the Arab-influenced Gidrán, half-bred Furioso-North Star, and the heavier Nonius.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{initially}} agreed to <b>these</b> <b>demands,</b> on January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu {{declared that he}} would not be bound by the Restoration proclamation and called for its rescission. On January 24, he decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto, occupied by Satsuma and Chōshū forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arsons in Edo, starting with the burning of the outerworks of Edo Castle, the main Tokugawa residence. This was blamed on Satsuma rōnin, who on that day attacked a government office. The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the daimyō of Satsuma, where many opponents of the shogunate, under Takamori's direction, had been hiding and creating trouble. The palace was burned down, and many opponents killed or later executed.|$|E

5|$|In 1569, the Treaty of Lublin unified Poland and Lithuania {{into the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno in 1566, came under Polish–Lithuanian joint sovereignty. In June 1570 a three-year truce was signed with Russia. Sigimund II, the Commonwealth's first King, died in 1572 leaving the Polish throne {{with no clear}} {{successor}} {{for the first time}} since 1382 and thus began the first free election in Polish history. Some Lithuanian nobles, in an effort to retain Lithuanian autonomy, proposed a Russian candidate. Ivan, however, demanded the return of Kiev, an Orthodox coronation, and a hereditary monarchy in parallel to Russia's, with his son, Fedor, as King. The electorate rejected <b>these</b> <b>demands</b> and instead chose Henry of Valois (Henryk Walezy), brother of King Charles IX of France.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, a meeting was held in Southery, Norfolk. The group, {{including}} a Thomas Sindall, marched through Denver to Downham Market {{to meet with the}} magistrates at their weekly meeting at The Crown public house. Sindall was the only person known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport. He was killed by troopers at Littleport—see below. The mob of 1,500, mainly men but some women, besieged The Crown until the magistrates agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas: to have work and two-shillings (£) per day. The magistrates acceded to <b>these</b> <b>demands,</b> but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell, who arrived at 5pm. Backed by the troops, the Riot Act was then read in the market place by Reverend Dering, causing further tussles, which subsided after arrests started to be made.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the effects of labor demand shifts and {{population}} adjustments across metropolitan areas on the employment and earnings of various demographic groups during the 1980 s. We find that population shifts across areas at least partially offset the effects of <b>these</b> <b>demand</b> shifts, but less-educated workers showed substantially lower population adjustments in response to <b>these</b> <b>demand</b> shifts. <b>These</b> limited supply responses apparently contributed importantly to relatively greater deterioration of employment and earnings of these groups in declining areas during the 1980 s.

A vector error correction model is constructed to investigate dynamic relation between <b>these</b> <b>demand</b> side variables and the Solow residual. Impulse response functions shows that the measured Solow residual moves pro-cyclically with the demand shocks, and that the forecast error variance of the measured Solow residual is mostly explained by past innovations of <b>these</b> <b>demand</b> side variables...|$|R

5|$|Holst's {{comic opera}} The Perfect Fool (1923) was {{widely seen as}} a satire of Parsifal, though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically {{received}} at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering concussion. He seemed {{to make a good}} recovery, and he felt up to accepting an invitation to the US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by <b>these</b> <b>demands</b> on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.|$|E
5|$|Militarily {{weaker than}} NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear {{missiles}} on Cuba {{to even the}} power balance. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defense only. Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was {{left out of the}} negotiations, in which Khruschev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. Presenting <b>these</b> <b>demands</b> to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the B-2 was not sufficient, and it was dropped in favour of the Ju 87 R {{long-range}} versions {{in the second half}} of 1940. The 105 R-1s were converted to R-2 status and a further 616 production R-2s were ordered. In May 1941, the development of the D-1 was planned and was ordered into production by March 1942. However, the expansion of the Junkers Ju 88 production lines to compensate for the withdrawal of Dornier Do 17 production delayed production of the Ju 87 D. The Weserflug plant in Lemwerder experienced production shortfalls. This prompted Erhard Milch to visit and threaten the company into meeting the RLM's Ju 87 D-1 requirements on 23 February 1942. To meet <b>these</b> <b>demands,</b> 700 skilled workers were needed. Skilled workers had been called up for military service in the Wehrmacht. Junkers were able to supply 300 German workers to the Weserflug factory, and as an interim solution, Soviet prisoners of war and Soviet civilians deported to Germany. Working around the clock, the shortfall was made good. WFG received an official commendation. By May 1942, demand increased further. Chief of Procurement General Walter Herthel found that each unit needed 100 Ju 87s as standard strength and an average of 20 per month to cover attrition. Not until June–December 1942 did production capacity increase, and 80 Ju 87s were produced per month.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the effects of labor demand shifts and {{population}} adjustments across metropolitan areas on the employment and earnings of various demographic groups during the 1980 s.
