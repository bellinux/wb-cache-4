5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of town.|$|E
5|$|In May 2000, twenty {{trees were}} planted, {{one for each}} boys who attended. During the {{planting}} ceremony, the Scout Chief Commissioner for England, along {{with representatives of the}} Scouts and the Guides, planted the <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seaward side of the original site. The trees were designed to act as a permanent memorial to the camp, as well as providing a series of future windbreaks against coastal winds.|$|E

5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tops of mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 1893 Fish {{was buried}} in Garrison at St. Philip's Church-in-the-Highlands Cemetery under waving <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills along the Hudson River shoreline.

5|$|The Cummer Gardens are 1.45 {{acres of}} {{historic}} gardens {{made up of}} native Florida plants, large live oak trees, {{and a number of}} reflecting pools, fountains, ornaments and sculptures. They are split into three themed gardens and a large lawn on the St. Johns River. Many of the original <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> property were felled in order to make room for flower beds, but those that remained grew up to 150 feet in size. Ninah Cummer adopted the lion as her personal motif, and lion details can be found all over the gardens.|$|E

5|$|Tourism was {{adversely}} affected; {{an estimated}} 60percent of hotel rooms were damaged. The winds downed 80percent of the nutmeg <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, with other crop losses varying between 60–90percent. An estimated 18,000people were left homeless by the hurricane, and about 700people sustained injuries from the storm. Ivan {{was considered the}} worst hurricane to strike the nation since Hurricane Janet in 1955; its passage resulted in 39fatalities and $1.1billion in damage (2004USD, ($ USD), about 200% of its GDP and of which about 45% resulted from housing damage.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{discovers that}} the {{surgical}} staple gun was tampered with. The guns come in packs of three but the pack was broken up between three surgeries, one {{was given to}} Ted, another to George White (Dan Amboyer) who Megan has to perform emergency surgery on after finding him near-dead, and the third staple gun was not used. Megan finds traces of fungus found on bonsai <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staple guns and Megan realizes that Gwen has bonsai trees. When her son died, he was pledging for the fraternity where George is president. Gwen tampered with the staple guns to kill George, not realizing that the pack would be broken up. Ethan and Curtis find out that Jessica had a genetic mutation that caused a blood clot, so Ethan warns Karen that she might also have one. Megan confronts Gwen, who confesses to Megan. Gwen is eventually taken away by the police, after admitting to George's attempted, and Ted's accidental murder.|$|E

5|$|More of {{his later}} works are the Jewish {{community}} center in Duisburg (1996–1999), and with Rafi Segal, the Palmach Museum in Tel Aviv (1995–2000). The Duisburg Jewish community center {{is located on}} a park, the Garten der Erinnerung designed by Dani Karavan. The community center shares a similar concept to the Page Memorial in its likening to the open pages of a book, and symbolically the Torah of Moses. The Palmach Museum has an angular zig-zag plan positioned around the preservation of <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site. It is clad in a local sandstone that was found in excavations for the project. It was exhibited at the Venice Biennale.|$|E
5|$|On 19 July 1975, a unit {{from the}} Rhodesian Territorial Force (TF) {{contacted}} {{a group of}} guerrillas near a river in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north-east of Mount Darwin in the area covered by Operation Hurricane. After the Territorials killed two of the insurgents without loss, the cadres fell back and set up an ambush position underneath the roots of some overhanging <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> riverbank. The TF patrol summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando, RLI from Mount Darwin, which arrived soon after. Coey, who was attached to 2 Commando at the time, accompanied 7 Troop as the patrol's combat medic.|$|E
5|$|On November 16, the Kiribati islands {{suffered}} the side-effects of Cyclone Tia, with several houses in Tarawa and seaweed farms damaged. Late on November 17, TCWC Nadi started to release special advisories for Vanautu {{after it had}} become clear that the systems south-southwest movement, would bring the cyclone sufficiently close to the Banks and Torres Islands to cause either gale or storm force winds. Over the next 24 hours, TCWC Nadi continued to issue these bulletins as the system moved southwards and brought gale force winds to Maewo, Pentecost and the Banks Islands before they issued the final advisory early on November 19. Tia {{was the first of}} six tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu during the 1991–92 South Pacific cyclone season, and caused minor damage that was mainly confined to houses, crops and fruit <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Banks and Torres Islands. Within the Banks Islands a church was flattened, several roads were blocked and a man was slightly injured by flying debris.|$|E

5|$|During {{the worst}} of the storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} wedge-shaped. It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes and snapping numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> property were ripped out of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed with pieces of large farm machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 yards away, a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were bent over. Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|While {{crossing}} Cuba, Lili primarily caused {{damage from}} its heavy rainfall {{and not from}} the winds. Nationwide, Lili damaged 92,542houses and destroyed another 6,369, mostly in Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus, which left thousands of people homeless. Heavy rains caused homes to collapse along the path, many already in poor condition. On Isla de la Juventud, the winds damaged 85houses and destroyed another 103. The winds also stripped 16tons of grapefruit from their <b>trees</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. Nationwide, {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees fell during the storm. On Cayo Largo del Sur, the strong waves wrecked seaside cabanas. In Villa Clara Province, about 45mi (75km) of roads were damaged, and the winds destroyed the roofs of 28sugar refineries. In Havana, the storm wrecked a dozen buildings and downed several trees. Nationwide, the hurricane downed hundreds of power lines, leaving many towns without power, and power plants were damaged in Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos provinces. The hurricane also damaged 21hospitals and dozens of health clinics, along with 32schools. Extensive crop damage occurred along the storm's path, affecting thousands of hectares of arable land, and damaging 105agricultural facilities. Flooding affected the banana, fruit, coffee, sugar cane, and rice crops. Nationwide, the storm damaged about 25,406hectares of bananas and 686,893hectares of sugar cane, along with 36,249hectares of other crops. In Sancti Espíritu, 28,000tons of rice were wrecked, and in Matanzas, 7,500tons of citrus crops were heavily damaged. Total damages in the country were estimated at $362million (1996 USD). There were no deaths in Cuba, and seven injuries.|$|E
