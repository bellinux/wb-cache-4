He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way". [...] "You know in fact <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> morals can go out the window if you think you can survive in a certain way, whatever your morals may be".|$|E

[...] You report us with your mouth, and we cut off your lips? [...] Who is to blame? [...] It is you! [...] The Bible says <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> hand, eye or mouth is at fault, it should be cut off." [...] While the {{government}} efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. [...] However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{found in}} [...] {{support for the}} proverb that if a person tells {{you that you have}} a donkey's ears, do not believe it, but if two tell it to you, order a halter. For Abraham called Hagar Sarai's servant the first time in [...] saying, [...] "Behold, your maid is in your hand." [...] And then the angel called Hagar Sarai's servant the second time in [...] saying, [...] "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid." [...] Thus, {{thereafter}} in [...] Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai." [...] Similarly, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari where Scripture supports the saying of the Rabbis <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> neighbor (justifiably) calls you a donkey, you should put a saddle on your back (and not quarrel to convince the neighbor otherwise). Rabbah bar Mari replied that the saying found support in [...] where first the angel calls Hagar [...] "Sarai's handmaid," [...] and then Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.".
