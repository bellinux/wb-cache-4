25|$|Trawling can {{be divided}} into bottom {{trawling}} and midwater trawling, depending on how high the <b>trawl</b> (<b>net)</b> is in the water column. Bottom trawling is towing the trawl along (benthic trawling) or close to (demersal trawling) the sea floor. Midwater trawling is towing the trawl through free water above {{the bottom of the ocean}} or benthic zone.|$|E
25|$|Using two {{trawlers}} {{to operate}} one <b>trawl</b> <b>net.</b> Both trawlers would sail in line astern formation; the first would fish {{while the second}} would attempt to fend off Icelandic vessels. Unfortunately, this not only {{cut the number of}} vessels engaged in fishing in half: it was also ineffective against Icelandic vessels, as the high standard of seamanship required to steer a heavy, unwieldy trawler in tight formation in rough Atlantic seas was simply too much for a civilian fisherman.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} {{opening of a}} <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> is created using flotation on the upper edge ("floatline") and weight on the lower edge ("footrope") of the net mouth. The configuration of the footrope varies based on the expected bottom shape. The more uneven the bottom, the more robust the footrope configuration must be to prevent net damage. This is used to catch shrimp, shellfish, cod, scallops and many others. Trawls are funnel-shaped nets that have a closed-off tail where the fish are collected and is open on the top end as the mouth.|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{interactions}} between dolphins and trawl fisheries {{have focused on the}} opportunistic feeding of dolphins on discards at the surface. Little is known about sub-surface associations between dolphins and actively fishing <b>trawl</b> <b>nets.</b> Using underwater video footage recorded inside <b>trawl</b> <b>nets,</b> we evaluated behavioural aspects of interactions between common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> in the Pilbara trawl fishery. The interaction rates were very high; in 85 hours of footage collected from 36 trawls, dolphins were recorded inside <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> during 29 (81 %) trawls and outside <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> in 34 (94 %) trawls, and for up to 98 % and 99 % of the trawl duration, respectively. The proportion of foraging behaviours was significantly higher for dolphins inside the net (54 %) than those outside the net (31 %), indicating that dolphins were presented with a concentrated food source inside the net. Dolphins observed outside the net spent time ‘trampolining’ and socialising, indicating that they were motivated by several factors to approach and interact with <b>trawl</b> <b>nets.</b> Twenty-nine individuals were identified inside the net, some returning to the net numerous times within each trawl and between different trawls and fishing trips. Our results suggest that these dolphins are highly motivated to interact with <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> and that entering nets may be a specialised behaviour exhibited only by a subset of trawler-associated dolphins. We conclude that gear modifications, not spatial or temporal adjustments to fishing effort, have the greatest potential to reduce dolphin bycatch in this fishery...|$|R

50|$|To {{minimize}} accidental {{capture of}} marine animals, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries developed and tested bycatch reduction devices (BRDs). These devices are openings in shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> that allow finfish or other unwanted aquatic animals to escape, while the target species, such as shrimp, is directed towards the tail bag or cod {{end of the}} net. The placement and design have been developed in conjunction with normal bottom trawling practices, using <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> outfitted with a turtle excluder device. BRDs are required in shrimp <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> working in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions.|$|R
25|$|Otter {{trawling}} derives {{its name}} from the large rectangular otter boards which are used to keep the mouth of the <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> open. Otter boards are made of timber or steel and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, push them outwards and prevent the mouth of the net from closing. They also act like a plough, digging up to 15cm into the seabed, creating a turbid cloud, and scaring fish towards the net mouth.|$|E
2500|$|The trawl doors {{disturb the}} sea bed, create {{a cloud of}} muddy water which hides the {{oncoming}} <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> and generates a noise which attracts fish. The fish begin to swim {{in front of the}} net mouth. As the trawl continues along the seabed, fish begin to tire and slip backwards into the net. Finally, the fish become exhausted and drop back, into the [...] "cod end" [...] and are caught.|$|E

50|$|In particular, {{sea turtles}} can be caught when bottom {{trawling}} {{is used by}} the commercial shrimp fishing industry. In order to catch shrimp, a fine meshed <b>trawl</b> <b>net</b> is needed. This results in large amounts of other marine organisms being also caught as bycatch. When a turtle gets caught or entangled in a <b>trawl</b> <b>net,</b> it becomes trapped and is unable to return to the surface.

50|$|<b>Trawl</b> <b>nets</b> in general, {{and shrimp}} trawls in particular, have been {{identified}} as sources of mortality for cetacean and finfish species. When bycatch is discarded (returned to the sea), it is often dead or dying.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the major site formation processes of commercial fish trawling and dredging impacts on mid-Atlantic ocean shipwrecks. Exploring this human-related interaction requires multi-disciplinary sources, including historical archival research, maritime archaeologists, fisheries, and sanctuary management. Non-traditional sources include fishermen who experience damage to their gear and divers who observe gear impact damage to shipwrecks. From statistical database analysis, shipwreck case studies, and fishing community interviews, this thesis demonstrates that 1) commercial <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> and dredges damage shipwrecks and 2) shipwrecks negatively affect commercial fishing. From a 52 -case sample, 69 % of mid-Atlantic shipwrecks have 1 to 5 derelict <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> or scallop dredges on site. Derelict scallop dredge presence on shipwrecks markedly increased near and in scallop marine protected areas. Wooden wrecks may not survive impacts of towed scallop and clam dredges. Millions {{of dollars of}} commercial <b>trawl</b> <b>nets</b> and scallop dredges continue to be lost each year on the U. S. East Coast. Commercial trawling and dredging is an archaeological site formation process with three modes: depositional, scrambling, and extraction. This study presents factual awareness and lays the foundation to formulate realistic, economically viable, and motivational proposals to safeguard commercial fishing gear and non-renewable underwater cultural resources.
