40|$|Abstract â€” We {{study the}} {{capacity}} of multi-hop wireless net. works with TCP regulated <b>tramr</b> We study the dependence of the capacity on the transmission range of nodes in the network. Specifically, we examine {{the sensitivity of the}} capacity tu the speed of the nodes and the number of TCP connections in an ad hoc net. work. By incorporating the notion of a minimal acceptable Qc 3 metric (loss) for au individual session, we argue that the QoSaware capacity is a more accurate model of the TCP-centric capacity of an ad-hoc network. We study the dependence of capacity on the source application (Telnet or FTP) and on the choice of the ad-hoc routing protocol (AODV, DSR or DSDV). We conclude that persistent and non-persistent traIXc behave quite diNerently in an ad-hoc network. 1...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{fisheries}} in Sri Lanka have changed signzpcantly {{in the past}} decades owing to various development activities, resulting in growing pressure on coastal zones. Consequently coastal fisheries resources and the environment are threatened {{by a number of}} factors: overexploitation of some resources such as lobsters in the south; the use of explosives such as dynamites; the use of destructive fuhing methods, e. g, <b>tramr.</b> I nets in the coral reef areas and the use of drag nets and push nets in the estuaries and lagoons; the entanglement of marine mammals and sea turtles in the drift gillnets used in catching tuna and other large pelagic fuh species; fishing techniques used in the ornamental fish trade and their impact on coral reefs; degradation caused by the rapid expansion of shrimp aquaculture, particularly in mangroves, saltmarshes and lagoons and estuaries along the northwestern coastal belt. Water quality has also deteriorated from the filling of lagoons for housebuilding in wetland areas, discharges of industrial and agricultural efluents, and discharges of untreated sewage and other waste water from tourist hotels and urban areas. With technical inputs ffom the National Aquatic resources Research an...|$|E
