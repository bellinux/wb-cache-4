5|$|Angle Lake station {{consists}} of a single island platform elevated above street level, {{on the west side}} of 28th Avenue South. The station has two entrances located on the north and south sides of South 200th Street, connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> by stairs, escalators and elevators. The station also has secure bicycle storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Search for Spock was {{released}} on home video in 1985. The initial retail offerings included VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc and CED formats with closed captioning. As {{part of a plan}} to support its push of 8mm video cassette, Sony partnered with Paramount Home Video to bring titles like The Search for Spock <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The other fare {{control area}} at the station's east (railroad north) end, {{accessed}} by a ramp <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> is unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and two staircases {{going up to the}} northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue. The token booth at this location was closed on July 30, 2005 and removed sometime afterward.|$|E
50|$|The station {{currently}} (as of 2015) has escalators (Otis type HD-B) to {{get down}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b> Alternatively, passengers can use <b>the</b> 113 steps <b>to</b> get down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Access paths <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> {{have been}} redefined since 2010; the old ticket hall is closed, and {{temporary}} access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> is via <b>the</b> {{left and right}} of the station building ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> of <b>the</b> Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld station are not {{barrier-free}} for <b>the</b> disabled. <b>To</b> get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> {{of tracks}} 2 to 5, {{it is necessary}} to use an underpass from platform 1. A door of the entrance building leads to a staircase leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pedestrian underpass <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{the first}} major Final Fantasy game for mobile devices, Before Crisis was {{designed}} as a gameplay and multiplayer experience unique <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> It is {{the first major}} project directed by Hajime Tabata, who created the initial concept at the request of Tetsuya Nomura for a game that had the Turks as protagonists. The music was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, originally a sound arranger at Square Enix. It was highly successful upon release, registering 200,000 users and being accessed over one million times. Western critics have generally praised the title, but due to issues involving the capacity of mobile devices in the west, it has not been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the other GNP stations, the station {{building}} was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather than the standard red glazed terracotta. This was due to planning regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with the other parts of the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first floor level was constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old {{station and the}} older {{platforms}} were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line {{was no longer a}} freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The 800-foot-long platform is located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 930-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> are available from the garage and from Central Square. The new facility opened on January 21, 1992.|$|E

5|$|Entering {{the main}} building, the ticket office and ticket {{machines}} are immediately ahead, and the route from Temple Quay and the ferry {{is on the}} left; a bookshop is on the right, next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> entrance. Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all platforms, as do displays {{on each of the}} platforms. All platforms are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station. Platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the platforms).|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 2007, Microsoft {{announced}} {{they were planning}} on releasing Ikaruga on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. It was released on 9 April 2008, and included new features such as leaderboards, achievements, {{and the ability to}} record and replay playthroughs. Treasure later released Ikaruga on the arcade distribution platform, NESiCAxLive, on 8 August 2013. In October 2013, Treasure placed the title into the Steam Greenlight process to bring the game (based on the Xbox 360 version) to Microsoft Windows, with hopes to bring their other titles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> later. The game was released on Steam on 18 February 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Nydalen district, {{formerly}} {{an industrial}} area, has since undergone urban redevelopment. The immediate {{vicinity of the}} station includes several large workplaces. In 2005, BI, with 8000 students and faculty, {{moved into a new}} campus across the street from Nydalen Station. Nydalen is the only underground station on the Ring Line. The escalators leading down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> features The Tunnel of Light, an artistic presentation of sound and colour around the passengers as they ascend from or to descend to the station. The artwork contains 1800 lights and 44 speakers. Nydalen also serves as a bus hub.|$|E

5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} railway platform, Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City Subway and was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{privatisation}} of British Rail in 1997, {{services were}} franchised to Wales & West, {{which was in}} turn succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, which was later rebranded Great Western Railway. Great Western Railway services to and from London Paddington started calling at Worle in 2007. Due to the trains being longer than the platforms, a selective door opening system was used to prevent passengers opening doors which were not adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia was based on a simple image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival at}} the {{terminus}} the mourners would be led either {{to one of the}} dedicated first class waiting rooms (for first and second class funerals) or to the communal third class waiting room. The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> level by lift. Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished. (After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902, some funeral services would be held in a Chapelle Ardente on platform level, for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood.) Each door of the waiting train would be labelled with the name of the deceased, to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn, and that person's mourners would board the train.|$|E
5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines, intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The building housed two mortuaries, the LNC's boardroom and funerary workshops, {{and a series of}} separate waiting rooms for those attending first, second and third class funerals. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> level above. Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel.|$|E

50|$|Particularly {{controversial}} was {{the desire}} of Deutsche Bundesbahn {{for the development of}} long ramps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> so that cars could reach the tracks. During the planning phase, the client was finally convinced of the necessity of stairs <b>to</b> connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> as well. <b>The</b> station would be fully accessible {{as a result of the}} ramp concept.|$|R
25|$|Three {{separate}} {{flights of}} stairs lead up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> Here, there is a dispatcher's office and crew quarters in {{the tops of the}} stair towers. There is a turnstile bank and MetroCard machines.|$|E
25|$|Two {{vertical}} alignment pendulums sent signals before launch to ground support equipment, which generated signals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> gyro torque generators {{to level the}} inner gimbal.

25|$|The only exit, {{located at}} the station's north end, leads to the Rutgers Street tunnel {{ventilation}} tower {{at the intersection of}} York Street and Jay Street. It has a turnstile bank and long passageway and staircase <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
