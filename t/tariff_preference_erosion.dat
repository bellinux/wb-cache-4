40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{economic}} {{assessment of the}} opportunities and challenges provided by the WTO 2 ̆ 019 s Doha Development Agenda, particularly through agricultural trade liberalization, for low-income countries seeking to trade {{their way out of}} poverty. After discussing links between poverty, economic growth and trade, it reports modelling results showing that farm product markets remain the most costly of all goods market distortions in world trade. It focuses on what such reform might mean for countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in particular, both without and with their involvement in the MTN reform process. What becomes clear is that if those countries want to maximize their benefits from the Doha round, they need also to free up their own domestic product and factor markets so their farmers are better {{able to take advantage of}} new market-opening opportunities abroad. Other concerns of low-income countries about farm trade reform also are addressed: whether there would be losses associated with <b>tariff</b> <b>preference</b> <b>erosion,</b> whether food-importing countries would suffer from higher food prices in international markets, whether China 2 ̆ 019 s WTO accession will provide an example of trade reform aggravating poverty via cuts to prices received by Chinese farmers, and the impact on food security and poverty alleviation.

40|$|The ongoing {{negotiations}} on non-agricultural market access (NAMA) in the WTO {{are expected to}} lead to substantive reductions in the tariff rates on industrial goods in both the developed and the developing countries. Although an agreement on the formula and coefficient(s) {{is yet to be}} reached, it is becoming increasingly clear that countries are moving towards a differentiated swiss-type formula with deeper cuts for higher tariffs. The July (2004) Framework Agreement stipulated that LDCs will not be required to undertake any tariff reduction commitments under the NAMA. However, LDCs are likely to suffer substantive <b>tariff</b> <b>preference</b> <b>erosion</b> as a consequence of NAMA negotiations since any tariff reduction by the developed countries will result in a fall in the preferential margins currently enjoyed by the LDCs under the various GSP schemes operated by the developed countries. Consequently, the competitive edge currently enjoyed by the LDCs by taking advantage of the preferential treatment under the various GSP schemes is set to suffer erosion. This is a major concern for Bangladesh and other LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper attempts to make an estimate about the range of preferential erosion for Bangladesh given her current trade pattern and preferential treatment enjoyed by her exports. The paper finds that for Bangladesh, the preferential erosion could be substantial (e. g. $ 42. 1 million worth of net preference erosion in the EU alone for RMG products under one of the possible scenarios). Reduced preference margin will also undermine future competitiveness in the developed country markets. It is also to be noted that tariff reductions under NAMA will have positive implications for Bangladesh in the US market where most of Bangladesh’s industrial goods do not enjoy GSP treatment. Thus, tariff reduction under NAMA is expected to have diverse implications for Bangladesh’s export of industrial goods. NAMA, thus, may increase Bangladesh’s competitive edge vis-à-vis Caribbean and Sub-Sahara African countries which are currently enjoying zero-tariff access for apparels under the AGOA and the CBI.

But little data have been available to back either view. The objective {{of this paper is}} to improve our measures of the size, utilization, and value of all U.

Highly disaggregated data are used to quantify the margins, coverage, utilization, and value of agricultural and nonagricultural <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> for all beneficiary countries in the U.

S. regional <b>tariff</b> <b>preference</b> programs are generally characterized by high coverage of beneficiary countries'exports, high utilization by beneficiary countries, and low <b>tariff</b> <b>preference</b> margins (except on apparel). For 29 countries, the value of U. S. <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> was 5 percent or more of 2003 dutiable exports to the United States, even after incorporating actual utilization. Most of this value is attributable to nonagricultural <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences,</b> and to apparel preferences in particular.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects of {{reducing}} tariffs under the Doha Round on market access for developing countries. It shows that for many developing countries, actual preferential access is less generous than it appears because of low product coverage or complex rules of origin. Thus lowering tariffs under the multilateral system is {{likely to lead to}} a net increase in market access for many developing countries, with gains in market access offsetting losses from <b>preference</b> <b>erosion.</b> Furthermore, comparing various tariff-cutting proposals, the research shows that the largest gains in market access are generated by higher tariff cuts in agriculture.

40|$|Preferential tariff {{rates are}} often not {{utilized}} by qualified beneficiaries. Two reasons are complex rules of origin and <b>erosion</b> of <b>preference</b> margins {{as a result of}} multilateral trade liberalization. Our paper contributes to this research by providing evidence from high-quality disaggregated customs data of the utilization rate for Australia's preferential trading arrangements in the period 2000 - 9. A pattern of low ratios of imports receiving preferential tariff treatment to the total value of bilateral imports applies to all six of Australia's PTAs. Over half of Australian imports from New Zealand, the Pacific Island Forum economies, Thailand and Chile claimed preferential treatment in 2000, but all had lower utilization rates by 2009. This is primarily because of the increasing number of zero MFN tariff lines. Where MFN tariffs are positive, preferential tariffs are utilized and preferred trading partners pay lower customs duties. Positive utilization rates indicate that <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> do have an impact, and at a minimum the exporters claiming the preferential tariff rate are better off than they would be in its absence, but by themselves utilization rates shed no light {{on the size of the}} impact on trade flows or on economic wellbeing. preferential <b>tariffs,</b> trade liberalization, <b>preference</b> <b>erosion...</b>|$|R

If Norway had no <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> in the EU market, her seafood exports would be charged tariffs at 1. 3 billion NOK or 6 % of the trade value. <b>Tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> under the Norway-EU free trade agreements cut tariffs by around half, and tariff quotas imply a further reduction to 0. 4 billion or 1. 84 % of the trade value. However, most other suppliers to the EU market have <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> that are as good or even better. For Norway, WTO liberalisation will reduce tariffs for its seafood exports to the EU and provide a clear overall gain.

40|$|With the {{signature}} of the Asuncion Treaty by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in July 1991, the four countries implemented an ambitious program to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers on their reciprocal trade; a common policy toward third countries was implemented in 1995. As MERCOSUR deepened further, intra-zone trade increased its share in total trade. In most cases, increasing intra-zone trade meant an increasing participation of goods where MERCOSUR members {{did not have a}} RCA {{at the beginning of the}} integration process. Starting from Krugman (1980) monopolistic competitive model for international trade we derive an equation to explain regional patterns of imports. Making use of a recently detailed database on intra-MERCOSUR tariffs we estimate the effect of <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> on the origin of imports of MERCOSUR members between 1991 and 2004. The results show <b>tariff</b> <b>preferences</b> affected imports patterns in the cases of Argentina and Uruguay, and to a less extent also those of Brazil and Paraguay.
