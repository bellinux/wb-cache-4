5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} ropes to prevent a fall. Realising the attempt was now a danger to himself and the balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However the ropes had become tangled and <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> were too short.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located in the house where she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early 14thcentury Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, {{at the edge of the}} churchyard of Holy Trinity church.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hook</b> {{and ring}} game {{was adopted by}} the earlier {{settlers}} of the Caribbean islands, where it is also referred to as the Bimini Ring Game. When <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> is attached to a post or pole, the ring can actually be swung behind <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> catching on <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> as it swings back. If the ring is caught by <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> <b>the</b> score is two points. If the ring is first swung from behind <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> and it swings back and catches on <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> <b>the</b> score for the throw is three points.|$|R
50|$|After a meeting, <b>the</b> <b>Hook</b> guesses Sylvester is {{the gypsy}} who stole {{the map and}} returns to the Governor's house to kill him. The Governor sees the map on Sylvester's chest as <b>the</b> <b>Hook</b> arrives. <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> chases him but is stopped from killing Sylvester by Featherhead who shoots him. As he has not returned, Pedro (Marc Lawrence), <b>the</b> <b>Hook's</b> second-in-command leads a raid on the Governor's house to rescue <b>the</b> <b>Hook</b> and after a big fight, {{inadvertently}} rescues Sylvester who has disguised himself as <b>the</b> <b>Hook,</b> along with Margaret.|$|R

5|$|Larger {{species of}} procellariid face similar {{problems}} to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait {{from the long}} lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> and drowning. In {{the case of the}} spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to gillnet fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).|$|E
5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush {{with the rest of the}} flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of buffers and chain couplers, the draw gear behind <b>the</b> <b>hooks,</b> if any, will absorb the tension, while the side buffers will absorb the compression.|$|E
50|$|Variations of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> are <b>the</b> shovel <b>hook</b> or upper-hook; {{they are}} body punches that combine {{characteristics}} of both <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> and <b>the</b> uppercut.|$|R
50|$|The player {{uses the}} 8-way {{joystick}} {{to control the}} biplane's movements, and the 2 buttons to shoot or <b>hook</b> enemies. <b>The</b> biggest characteristic of the player's biplane is <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> attached to its rear section. <b>The</b> <b>hook</b> is also controlled by the joystick, and enemies or objects that {{come in contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> are dragged along by the plane. Dragged objects cause damage to anything they collide with, and the player can release the objects on <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> by pressing <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> button again. Dragged objects are destroyed when the player releases them from <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> or if they collide enough times to break apart.|$|R

25|$|Dating {{from the}} later medieval era, {{and now a}} popular tourist attraction, is the Shambles, a street of timber-framed shops {{originally}} occupied by butchers. Some retain the outdoor shelves and <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> on which meat was displayed. They have overhanging upper floors and are now largely souvenir shops.|$|E
25|$|The {{wood mouse}} Apodemus sylvaticus {{possesses}} spermatozoa with falciform morphology. Another characteristic which makes these gametocytes unique {{is the presence}} of an apical hook on the sperm head. This hook is used to attach to <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> or to the flagella of other spermatozoa. Aggregation is caused by these attachments and mobile trains result. These trains provide improved motility in the female reproductive tract and are a means by which fertilization is promoted.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers have {{expressed}} concern about the Velcro on the ACU. Dirt and mud can clog <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> and loops or they can wear out with use, requiring the use of cleaning brushes for clearing the Velcro as part of daily maintenance. Zippers have also been a topic of concern. Soldiers also expressed concern because the zippers (as with any zipper) can bind up, and render the uniform uncomfortable to wear, especially with body armor.|$|E

40|$|The axial {{proteins}} of the bacterial flagellum {{function as}} a drive shaft, universal joint, and propeller driven by the flagellar rotary motor; they also form the putative protein export channel. The N- and C-terminal sequences of the eight axial proteins were predicted to form interlocking α-domains generating an axial tube. We report on an ≈ 1 -nm resolution map of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> from Salmonella typhimurium, which reveals such a tube made from interdigitated, 1 -nm rod-like densities similar to those seen in maps of the filament. Atomic models for the two outer domains of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> subunit were docked into the corresponding outermost features of the map. The N and C termini of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> subunit fragment are positioned {{next to each other}} and face toward the axis of <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> <b>The</b> placement of these termini would permit the residues missing in the fragment to form the rod-like features that form the core domain of <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> We also fit <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> atomic model to an ≈ 2 -nm resolution map of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> from Caulobacter crescentus. <b>The</b> <b>hook</b> protein sequence from C. crescentus is largely homologous to that of S. typhimurium except for a large insertion (20 kDa). According to difference maps and our fitting, this insertion is found on the outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> consistent with our modeling of <b>the</b> <b>hook...</b>|$|R
5000|$|As one author {{writes about}} the meaning of the kartika: The {{traditional}} interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> in Tibetan Buddhist imagery is that of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> of compassion. It is <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> which pulls beings out of the cycles of transmigration. <b>The</b> <b>hooked</b> crescent-shaped knife of the dakini with its vajra handle pulls one forth from suffering, chops up the ego-centred self and is guided by the diamond clarity of the vajra.|$|R
25|$|New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) are {{notable for}} their highly {{developed}} tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, then use <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> to pull insect larvae from tree holes. Tools are engineered according to task and apparently also to learned preference. Recent studies revealed abilities to solve complicated problems, which suggests {{high level of}} innovation of a complex nature. Other corvids that have been observed using tools include the American crow, blue jay and green jay. Diversity in tool design among corvids suggests cultural variation. Again, great apes are the only other animals known to use tools in such a fashion.|$|E
25|$|When {{negative}} pressure (pushing {{down on the}} spine) {{is applied to the}} blade all the stress is transferred from the hook on the blade's tang to the hook on rocker bar and thence to the small rocker pin. Excessive stress can shear one or both of these hooks rendering the knife effectively useless. Knife company Cold Steel uses a variant of the lock back called the Tri-Ad Lock which introduces a pin in front of the rocker bar to relieve stress on the rocker pin, has an elongated hole around the rocker pin to allow the mechanism to wear over time without losing strength and angles <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> so that the faces no longer meet vertically.|$|E
25|$|The {{eye of a}} hook, {{although}} some hooks are technically eyeless, is {{the point where the}} hook is connected to the line. Hook eye design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. There are different types of eyes to <b>the</b> <b>hooks.</b> Typical eye types include the ring or ball eye, a brazed eye-the eye is fully closed, a tapered eye to reduce weight, a looped eye—traditional on Atlantic Salmon flies, needle eyes, and spade end—no eye at all, but a flattened area to allow secure snelling of the leader to the hook. Hook eyes can also be positioned one of three ways on the shank—up turned, down turned or straight.|$|E
5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. <b>The</b> <b>hook</b> was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> in a dare, and <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> became known as Nelson's <b>Hook</b> after <b>the</b> Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Brockman further claims that <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. <b>The</b> <b>hook</b> by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hook</b> {{point is}} {{probably}} {{the most important part of}} <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> It is <b>the</b> point that must penetrate fish flesh and secure the fish. The profile of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Hook points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened. Some hooks are barbless. Historically, many ancient fish hooks were barbless, but today a barbless hook is used to make hook removal and fish release less stressful on <b>the</b> fish. <b>Hook</b> points are also described relative to their offset from <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> shank. A kirbed hook point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right. Care needs to be taken when handling hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a <b>hook.</b> <b>The</b> first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> off and then push the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> through <b>the</b> flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> out <b>the</b> way it came in.|$|R
50|$|A {{disgorger}} {{is used by}} slipping the {{end over}} a tight line and sliding down to the bend of <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> A push is then needed to remove <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Under <b>the</b> pressure of <b>the</b> line, <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> will tighten against {{the end of the}} disgorger and can be removed from the mouth.|$|R
25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling. Remote uncoupling is possible by using a sprung ramp between the rails. The design of <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> is such that the couplings will not uncouple when under tension (instead depressing the ramp). When the train is pushed over the ramp, it will lift the coupling hooks as the train passes over. By halting the train over the ramp, it is split at this point. While it works well, it is often seen as ugly and obtrusive (although smaller designs are available, these are not always fully compatible with other models) and many British modellers prefer to retrofit either Kadee types or working hook and chain couplings.|$|E
25|$|Some species brood their fertilized eggs: female paper {{nautilus}} construct {{shelters for}} the young, while Gonatiid squid carry a larva-laden membrane from <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> on their arms. Other cephalopods deposit their young under rocks and aerate {{them with their}} tentacles hatching. Mostly the eggs are {{left to their own}} devices; many squid lay sausage-like bunches of eggs in crevices or occasionally on the sea floor. Cuttlefish lay eggs separately in cases and attach them to coral or algal fronds. Like Pacific salmon, cephalopods are mostly semelparous, spawning many small eggs in one batch and then dying. Cephalopods usually live fast and die young. Most of the energy extracted from their food is used for growing, and they mature rapidly to their adult size. Some gain as much as 12% of their body mass each day. Most live for one to two years, reproducing and then dying shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Cory Kaplan {{explains how}} she was attracted {{to the idea of}} using primitive materials when she states, [...] "We all see super-tech now, but the idea of low-tech was much more interesting to me, much more visual. So, you take elements of rock and steel and chisel them into interesting shapes." [...] She also describes the creation of the set by stating, [...] "I found the backdrop from Alien, and Bill Roe lit it very dimly and put it behind. And it was just this rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull his face apart." [...] According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped {{in the creation of the}} alien torture machine by making the cheeks and putting <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> in. The makeup supervisor adds that <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> would actually stretch out and that David Duchovny [...] "sat pretty good through all that." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Hann, {{writing for}} The Guardian, rated the album three stars out of five, finding {{it did not}} measure up to the band's earlier work, picking out their earlier single [...] "Destroy Everything You Touch" [...] as a {{yardstick}} [...] "that subsequent work will always be judged against". Hann found that some of Gravity the Seducers tracks, particularly [...] "Ritual", seemed [...] "unfinished and unsatisfactory". Spin magazine's Barry Walters rated the album six out of ten, finding that it [...] "lacks the infectious, dark-disco rumble" [...] of Ladytron's earlier work, noting that it [...] "withhold <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> that previously put the sweet in their bitter".|$|E
