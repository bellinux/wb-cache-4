With the first episode of low back pain <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> a complete cure; however, if the problem becomes chronic, the goals may change to pain management and the recovery of as much function as possible. As pain medications are only somewhat effective, expectations regarding their benefit may differ from reality, and {{this can lead to}} decreased satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Street Initiative, a 20-year plan to {{make the}} city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, began in 2013 with the {{conversion}} of one-way streets to two-way streets. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> to bring more businesses to the area, create shorter travel routes, and to reduce speeding. This phase {{of the project was}} expected to be completed by 2016. The other part of the initiative is the West Side Main Streets Plan, which is a revitalization plan for the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridor focusing on guiding business owners, residents, and developers to improve the street front by offering a reimbursement on exterior improvements from the city and the Urban Enterprise Association.|$|E

25|$|The {{aim of the}} RLC was {{initially}} to provide regular fixtures for new clubs based outside the 'heartland' of rugby league, although as the playing standards increased, it also accepted teams from the 'heartlands'. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that, {{at least some of}} these clubs, would eventually progress to become semi-professional clubs that could one day join the 'traditional' clubs in Championship 1; to date, London Skolars have done so with both Hemel Stags and Oxford Rugby League joining in 2013, Coventry Bears in 2014 and Nottingham Outlaws will join Championship 1 in the 2016 season.|$|E
25|$|Starting in January 2016, Austrian {{police forces}} will be trialling the use of body cameras, which {{will be used to}} film their {{interactions}} with civilians. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that this will make the prosecution of any officers who are excessively violent or forceful a lot easier as there will be solid evidence, and also that it will deter officers from behaving violently in the first place, as they will know they are being monitored.

Although this scenario of illuminated clothing is highly plausible, challenges are still a road block. Some issues include: the lifetime of the OLED, rigidness of flexible foil substrates, and the lack of research in making more fabric like photonic textiles.|$|E

25|$|Many {{artists are}} using the Internet to give away music to create {{awareness}} and liking to a new upcoming album. The artists release a new song {{on the internet for}} free download, which consumers can download. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> to have the listeners buy the new album because of the free download. A common practice used today is releasing a song or two on the internet for consumers to indulge. In 2007, Radiohead released an album named in Rainbows, in which fans could pay any amount they want, or download it for free.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the new scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) fingerprinting technique, which makes no physical contact with the fingerprint and {{does not require the}} use of developers, has the potential to allow fingerprints to be recorded whilst still leaving intact material that could subsequently be subjected to DNA analysis. A forensically usable prototype was under development at Swansea University during 2010, in research that was generating significant interest from the British Home Office and a number of different police forces across the UK, as well as internationally. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that this instrument could eventually be manufactured in sufficiently large numbers to be widely used by forensic teams worldwide.|$|E

25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E
25|$|After the prelude, {{a church}} service is just {{ending with a}} singing of Da zu dir der Heiland kam (When the Saviour came to thee), an {{impressive}} pastiche of a Lutheran chorale, as Walther von Stolzing, a young knight from Franconia, addresses Eva Pogner, whom he had met earlier, and asks her if she is engaged to anyone. Eva and Walther have fallen in love at first sight, but she informs him that her father, the goldsmith and mastersinger Veit Pogner, has arranged to give her hand in marriage to {{the winner of the}} guild's song contest on St. John's Day (Midsummer's Day), tomorrow. Eva's maid, Magdalena, gets David, Hans Sachs's apprentice, to tell Walther about the mastersingers' art. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> for Walther to qualify as a mastersinger during the guild meeting, traditionally held in the church after Mass, and thus earn a place in the song contest despite his utter ignorance of the master-guild's rules and conventions.|$|E
25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because {{they are likely to be}} in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E

500|$|A {{major part}} of the {{scientific}} literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains—that is, studies of the neural correlates of consciousness. [...] <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> to find that activity in a particular part of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness. [...] Several brain imaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies.|$|E

The event is held annually {{on the last}} Saturday of April [...] with hundreds of visitors {{of all ages and}} backgrounds, including some former incarcerees, gathering at the Manzanar cemetery to remember the incarceration. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that participants can learn about it and help ensure that what is generally accepted to be a tragic chapter in American History is neither forgotten nor repeated. The program traditionally consists of speakers, cultural performances, an interfaith service to memorialize those who died at Manzanar, and Ondo dancing.|$|E
5000|$|On Henslowe's {{death in}} 1616, his {{son-in-law}} Edward Alleyn inherited Henslowe's share in <b>the</b> <b>Hope,</b> which Alleyn then leased to Meade. <b>The</b> <b>Hope</b> remained an active facility {{for the coming}} decades.
