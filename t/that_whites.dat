5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict {{the behavior of the}} arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
50|$|Some {{research}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>white</b> voters' voting behavior {{is motivated by}} racial threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found <b>that</b> <b>white</b> Chicago voters' turnout decreased when public housing was reconstructed and 25,000 African Americans displaced. This suggest <b>that</b> <b>white</b> voters' turnout decreased due to not living in proximity to African-Americans.|$|R
50|$|Other {{commentators}} have argued <b>that</b> <b>White</b> exaggerates {{the threat posed}} by China in the Asian region. Professor Paul Dibb from the Australian National University argued <b>that</b> <b>White</b> has overstated the ability of China to assert its power.|$|R
50|$|An {{apocryphal}} account states <b>that</b> <b>White</b> {{was almost}} captured by General Godfrey Weitzel's Union army when they invaded Bayou Lafourche in October 1862, {{but that he}} evaded capture by hiding beneath hay in a barn. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>White</b> enlisted in the Lafourche militia, as its muster rolls are not complete. There is no documentation, however, <b>that</b> <b>White</b> served in any Confederate volunteer unit or militia unit engaged in campaigns in the Lafourche area.|$|R
5|$|On September 1, 1857, a joint {{force of}} Mohave and Quechan warriors {{launched}} a major attack {{with hundreds of}} warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described {{by a group of}} white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.|$|E
5|$|With the Burger's {{house now}} empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, {{a student who}} had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad {{questions}} her about {{her role in the}} Burger family and asks why she always did what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a flat on her own and works as a physiotherapist. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in Soweto, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to Nice in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Rhodesians {{presumed that}} {{in the event of}} Federal dissolution, they would be first in line for independence, and would receive it without major {{adjustments}} to their 1961 constitution. Indeed, intergovernmental correspondence during early 1963 did much to confirm Salisbury's belief that this was the case. While Federal break-up talks progressed, Sandys issued a letter of intent in which he said that powers conferred on the Federal government by British legislation would transfer to Southern Rhodesia at the end of Federation. It was agreed that Salisbury would keep the Federal overseas missions in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques, as well as the British Embassy desks in Bonn, Tokyo and Washington. Arrangements for Federal dissolution concluded in mid-1963, and the Federation formally ended on 31 December that year. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland became independent during 1964, respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi, under black majority governments. Southern Rhodesia was denied the same on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> held too dominant a position, prompting indignation and fury from the governing Rhodesian Front (RF) and its supporters. Prime Minister Winston Field's failure to secure independence from Britain during early 1964 led to his forced resignation and replacement by his deputy, Ian Smith, in April that year.|$|E
25|$|Boyd was {{a public}} {{advocate}} for African American civil rights. As early as the 1890s he voiced his concern <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> planned to reverse the civil rights gains that African Americans had made {{in the years after}} the Civil War, and in subsequent years he worked against the Jim Crow laws enacted to enforce segregation.|$|E
25|$|It {{took years}} for {{business}} ownership {{to reflect the}} new reality. A survey in 1929 found <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> owned and operated 81.51% of the neighborhood's 10,319 businesses, with beauty parlors making up {{the largest number of}} black-owned businesses. By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.|$|E
40|$|Scholarship {{on racial}} attitudes has found <b>that</b> <b>white</b> {{veterans}} of World War II and the Korean War had more positive views of blacks than white civilians. However, more {{recent studies have}} argued <b>that</b> <b>white</b> veterans who have served in an all-volunteer force (AVF) now express more virulent views of blacks. Using data from the 2010 - 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we explore whether military service continues to predict positive racial attitudes. We find <b>that</b> <b>white</b> veterans express more negative views of blacks relative to <b>white</b> civilians and <b>that</b> <b>white</b> veterans in the AVF generation exhibit the most negative views of blacks. Taken together, we believe that our results suggest a reassessment {{of the role of}} contemporary military experiences in liberalizing white racial attitudes and offer support for the self-selection perspective...|$|R
50|$|David Cole argues <b>that</b> <b>White’s</b> {{view and}} the CLS {{are not that}} different; both are built on ideology. Cole criticizes White for relying too much on law {{as an end in}} itself, and failing to address the {{practical}} application of tangible, codified law. Meanwhile, Weisberg’s main criticism of Heracles’ Bow is <b>that</b> <b>White’s</b> explanation remains too abstract. He contends <b>that</b> <b>White</b> does not express any knowledge of the actual law or the application thereof. Weisburg argues <b>that</b> <b>White</b> relies on law too much as a function of pure rhetoric, and that he ignores the scientific aspect of the discipline. This is a common criticism of the Law and Literature Movement. Victoria Kahn claims <b>that</b> <b>White’s</b> view of the law ignores the relationship of law and inequality. She criticizes his work for its lack of explaining how the rhetoric of law is applied to different genders, races, and classes in different ways. She argues that seeing law simply as a rhetorical situation ignores the real-life power struggles within the application of law to society.|$|R

25|$|Overwhelmed by {{the sheer}} number of whites, more blacks retreated north on Greenwood Avenue to the edge of town. Chaos ensued as terrified {{residents}} fled for their lives. The rioters shot indiscriminately and killed many residents along the way. Splitting into small groups, they began breaking into houses and buildings, looting. Several blacks later testified <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> broke into occupied homes and ordered the residents out to the street, where they could be driven or forced to walk to detention centers.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010s, ethnic {{entrepreneurship}} {{has been}} studied {{in the case of}} Cuban business owners in Miami, Indian motel owners of the U.S. and Chinese business owners in Chinatowns across the United States. While entrepreneurship offers these groups many opportunities for economic advancement, self-employment, and business ownership in the United States remain unevenly distributed along racial/ethnic lines. Despite numerous success stories of Asian entrepreneurs, a recent statistical analysis of U.S. census data shows <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> are more likely than Asians, African-Americans, and Latinos to be self-employed in high prestige, lucrative industries.|$|E
25|$|In Greenwood, rumors {{began to}} fly – in particular, a report <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> were {{storming}} the courthouse. Shortly after 10pm, a second, larger group of approximately 75 armed black men {{decided to go}} to the courthouse. They offered their support to the sheriff, who declined their help. According to witnesses, a white man is alleged to have told one of the armed black men to surrender his pistol. The man refused, and a shot was fired. That first shot may have been accidental, or meant as a warning; it was a catalyst for an exchange of gunfire.|$|E

25|$|White Spanish and Cuban criollos saw cabildos as a {{necessary}} evil. By the 18th century, these spaces of cultural autonomy and support began to worry slaves' white masters. Articles of the 1792 Bando de Buen Gobierno y Policia address the necessity of controlling the cabildos and their members. Neighbors often complained about the unpleasant noises made by the slaves as they sang and played African instruments. By the 19th century, cabildos were re-located outside {{the walls of the}} city of Havana so <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> would not have to see or hear their African celebrations. For the Afro-Cubans, this expulsion added a degree of privacy that they had previously lacked.|$|E
25|$|The WPA, NYA, and CCC relief {{programs}} allocated 10% {{of their}} budgets to blacks (who comprised about 10% {{of the total}} population, and 20% of the poor). They operated separate all-black units with the same pay and conditions as white units. Some leading white New Dealers, especially Eleanor Roosevelt, Harold Ickes, and Aubrey Williams worked to ensure blacks received at least 10% of welfare assistance payments. However, these benefits were small {{in comparison to the}} economic and political advantages <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> received. Most unions excluded blacks from joining. Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the South was virtually impossible, especially since most blacks worked in hospitality and agricultural sectors.|$|E
25|$|There were {{no legal}} {{restrictions}} on the importation or use of opium in the United States until the San Francisco Opium Den Ordinance, which banned dens for public smoking of opium in 1875, a measure fueled by anti-Chinese sentiment and the perception <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> were starting to frequent the dens. This was followed by an 1891 California law requiring that narcotics carry warning labels and that their sales be recorded in a registry; amendments to the California Pharmacy and Poison Act in 1907 made {{it a crime to}} sell opiates without a prescription, and bans on possession of opium or opium pipes in 1909 were enacted.|$|E

25|$|The black scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, in his , {{published}} in 1935, compared results across {{the states to}} show achievements by the Reconstruction legislatures and to refute claims about wholesale African-American control of governments. He showed black contributions, as {{in the establishment of}} universal public education, charitable and social institutions and universal suffrage as important results, and he noted their collaboration with whites. He also pointed out <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> benefited most by the financial deals made, and he put excesses in the perspective of the war's aftermath. He noted that despite complaints, several states kept their Reconstruction constitutions for nearly a quarter of a century. Despite receiving favorable reviews, his work was largely ignored by white historians of his time.|$|E
25|$|Post-World War I, northeastern Oklahoma had {{a racially}} and {{politically}} tense atmosphere. The territory {{had been established}} for resettlement of Native Americans from the Southeast, {{some of whom had}} owned slaves. Other areas had received many settlers from the South, whose families had been slaveholders before the American Civil War. It was admitted as a state on November 16, 1907. The newly created state legislature passed racial segregation laws, commonly known as Jim Crow laws, as one of its first orders of business. Its 1907 constitution and laws had voter registration rules that effectively disenfranchised most blacks; this also barred them from serving on juries or in local office, a situation <b>that</b> <b>whites</b> enforced until after passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. Major cities passed additional restrictions.|$|E
