5|$|The largest {{study to}} date {{followed}} {{over a thousand}} people for eight years; it showed an 87% increased risk of death compared to the normal population. Predictors of higher risk were: female sex, absence of treatment for sex hormone deficiency, younger age {{at the time of}} diagnosis, and a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Apart from cardiovascular disease, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>also</b> showed an increased risk of death from lung disease.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>also</b> determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E

5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>also</b> recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E
5|$|Based on parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis, {{the most}} recent common {{ancestor}} of all eukaryotes most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; {{the absence of the}} pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic. This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer-like protein, one argonaute, one PIWI protein, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that may also have played other cellular roles. A large-scale comparative genomics study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic crown group already possessed these components, which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the exosome. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>also</b> suggests that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as Aquifex aeolicus), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the translation initiation system.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>also</b> found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>also</b> showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|Some of Antarctica {{has been}} warming up; {{particularly}} strong warming {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>also</b> noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.|$|E
