Objective of this project is to create a recreation <b>tandem</b> <b>bicycle</b> that can be use for outdoor activity and suit for adults and kids and can be ride with 2 person cycling. This <b>tandem</b> <b>bicycle</b> equipped with body stand seats that suits for an older person. The seats made using sponge and leather. This <b>tandem</b> <b>bicycle</b> also equipped with the foot rest for the rider to place their feet when not in cycling position while the other rider can continue cycling unmolested. The mobile phone charger using dynamo is placed on this bicycle for ease of the rider to charge their electronic devices that requires electricity without worrying run out of battery.

40|$|An {{important}} {{outcome of}} formal {{education is the}} acquisition of knowledge that will facilitate domain specific problem-solving skill. Theories of human intelligence identify general reasoning as a cognitive ability that is strongly associated with solving novel problems where learning about the problem is necessary. This dissertation investigates individual differences, such as general reasoning, that may influence how an individual structures knowledge within a domain, such as <b>bicycle</b> <b>gears,</b> and subsequent problem-solving skill. Special focus is given to identifying the structural characteristics of the acquired <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> knowledge and relating these characteristics to general reasoning and skill at solving <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> problems. College participants (N = 174, 111 female) completed a general reasoning test, reported the bicycle parts they knew, and their mechanical self-efficacy was assessed before they watched a training video on <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> adjustment. After training, {{the extent of their}} procedural knowledge was tested, the structure of their knowledge was elicited, and then their skill at fixing <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> problems was tested. Professional bicycle mechanics (N = 3) were recruited to provide a criterion for evaluating the structural characteristics of <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> knowledge. The results from regression analysis indicated that <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> problem-solving skill had a stronger relation with how knowledge was structured, as compared to the extent of procedural knowledge, general reasoning, mechanical self-efficacy, or problem-solving effort. Regression analysis of knowledge structure indicated that general reasoning was associated with acquiring an expert-like knowledge structure, as was learning effort and pre-training bicycle part knowledge, but not mechanical self-efficacy. These results support the view that general reasoning is associated with problem solving because it facilitates the acquisition of knowledge that is structured similarly to experienced professionals. If it is the structure of knowledge that facilitates or hinders problem-solving, as suggested by this study’s results, mechanical training may be enhanced by an explicit focus on structuring knowledge to replicate that of experts. A focus on using educational materials that impart the desired knowledge structure may significantly reduce the need of general reasoning in achieving mechanical expertise...|$|R
