5|$|On 11 August 1828, Corder {{was taken}} to the gallows in Bury St Edmunds, {{apparently}} <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to stand without support.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 1997 he {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Order of Merit; by this point he was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to travel to London to receive it, so instead a {{representative}} of the Queen travelled to Whitchurch to present it to him.|$|E
5|$|The General never leaves South America. He {{finishes}} his journey in Santa Marta, <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> {{to continue and}} with only his doctor and his closest aides by his side. He dies in poverty, a shadow {{of the man who}} liberated much of the continent.|$|E
5000|$|As with Goring's horse, Newcastle's {{infantry}} {{were from}} <b>too</b> many <b>weak</b> regiments to list separately. On the battlefield they were formed into seven [...] "divisions".|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to further extend its line, Allard adapted its P1 saloon to produce the 8-seater, wood-sided, V8-engined, P2 Safari Estate. It <b>too</b> found <b>weak</b> sales.|$|R
5000|$|By extension, the {{terminology}} was also applied to Germanic nouns. Here <b>too,</b> the <b>weak</b> noun was the consonantal declension, {{such as the}} German nouns that form their genitive in -n. Examples: ...|$|R
5|$|Along with Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) and his {{daughter}} Maggie (Lauren Cohan), the group organize Sophia's search. Since Shane is still injured and Rick is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> from blood loss, Daryl ventures out on his own. Daryl eventually finds an abandoned house, but does not locate Sophia. He finds a cherokee rose, which is a Native American sign in which the gods protected their children, and gives it to Carol.|$|E
5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|His dispositions for {{the battle}} are {{described}} as a clear mistake leaving the right far too strong and the left much <b>too</b> <b>weak.</b> Only the fact that Bagration and Barclay were to cooperate fully saved the Russian army and did much to mitigate the bad positioning. Nothing would be more damning than 300 artillery pieces standing silent on the Russian right.|$|E
6000|$|Lord, we that snatch the swords of flame, [...] Lord, we that {{cry about}} Thy car. [...] We <b>too</b> are <b>weak</b> {{with pride and}} shame, [...] We too are as our foemen are.|$|R
5000|$|... crypt is {{considered}} far <b>too</b> cryptographically <b>weak</b> to withstand brute force attacks by modern computing systems (Linux systems generally ship with GNU Privacy Guard which {{is considered}} to be reasonably secure by modern standards) ...|$|R
60|$|The battle {{had been}} of short duration, but the {{excitement}} had been intense, and Dave found himself {{bathed in a}} cold perspiration from head to foot. His father, <b>too,</b> was <b>weak,</b> and now sank on the rocks, breathing heavily.|$|R
5|$|Just before 05:00, the battalion's survivors, just 75 {{men of the}} 150 who had set out, {{left the}} battery and headed for their {{secondary}} objective, the village of La Plein. The battalion, being <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> only managed to liberate around half of the village, and had to await {{the arrival of the}} 1st Commando Brigade later in the day to complete its capture.|$|E
5|$|Later in June, {{the ship}} rejoined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla and {{spent most of}} the next two years escorting convoys. Late in 1940 the Flotilla was redesignated as the 9th Escort Group. Havelock was {{attached}} to Force H in Gibraltar to reinforce the escort during Operations Tiger in May 1941. The ship returned to the Western Approaches command afterwards as her anti-aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> for operations in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have to molt to grow {{as their}} cuticle ("skin") cannot stretch. In some species males mate with newly molted females, which are <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to be {{dangerous}} to the males. Most spiders live for only one to two years, although some tarantulas can live in captivity for over 20 years.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will carry}} you, {{as much as}} I can," [...] her mother said, [...] "but {{it can only be}} for a short {{distance}} at a time; for I, <b>too,</b> am <b>weak,</b> and your weight is too much for me.|$|R

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] Vibhanshu Shekhar, Visiting Fellow at the East-West Center in Washington, {{explains}} that "The Indonesian leadership views ASEAN as <b>too</b> small, <b>weak,</b> and disunited to adequately represent the country's national interests in the Indo-Pacific region…[leading] to an increasingly marginal position of ASEAN in Jakarta's regional diplomacy. ...|$|R
5|$|No {{operations}} {{are reported in}} Sicily {{for the first two}} years after the fall of Palermo. The Muslims were probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to react, and could not expect any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until his sudden death in August 833.|$|E
5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the typhoon's {{arrival in}} China, {{officials}} evacuated 467,900people, {{many of them}} to government shelters across the region. It was estimated that about 30% of coastal houses were <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to withstand the winds from the typhoon. In addition, officials ordered the closure of all restaurants and entertainment venues. Ferry service near Shanghai was disrupted, and 9,900ships were moved to safer areas. In addition, several airports across the region were closed, including in Shanghai.|$|E
5000|$|... crypt(1) is {{a simple}} command to encrypt or decrypt data. Usually this {{is used as a}} filter, and it has {{traditionally}} been implemented using an algorithm based on the Enigma machine. It is considered to be far <b>too</b> cryptographically <b>weak</b> to provide any security against brute force attacks by modern, commodity personal computers.|$|R

25|$|The above hadith from Sunan Abu Dawud {{has been}} narrated by Al-Hakim and Al-Bayhaqy as well, with similar wording, but they <b>too</b> are {{considered}} <b>weak</b> chains of transmitters.|$|R
5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations {{came close to}} declaring war on each other, {{although}} neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> militarily {{to engage in a}} fight unaided.|$|E
5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} wooden poles used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe wooden logs set into the beaches of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean to disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these wooden defenses <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E
5|$|Situated on {{the western}} fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines {{experiences}} frequent seismic and volcanic activity. The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction. Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily, though most are <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to be felt. The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.|$|E
60|$|Ken tried manfully to {{entertain}} Worry's idea about it, {{but he was}} <b>too</b> dazed and <b>weak</b> to stand alone. He imagined he had broken every bone in his body.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the book}} were hidden tragic {{elements}} in the author's own life: Robin, like several of his characters, was named after his son who had {{died at the age}} of seven, and the camaraderie of the boys was BB's imagination of the friendships he had never had as a child (having been considered <b>too</b> physically <b>weak</b> to mix with others).|$|R
6000|$|... "My son shall {{tell you}} that by-and-by," [...] said she; [...] "but at present you are <b>too</b> {{confused}} and <b>weak</b> for conversation: try to eat some breakfast, and then sleep." ...|$|R
5|$|The General finally {{receives}} his passport, and {{two days}} later he sets off with his entourage for Cartagena and the coast, where more receptions are held in his honor. Throughout this time, he is surrounded by women but is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to engage in sexual relations. The General is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency, Field Marshal Sucre, has been ambushed and assassinated.|$|E
5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much {{later on in}} the 15th century, by that time the Byzantines were <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.|$|E
5|$|After Paul {{wakes up}} and {{mentions}} that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing. Mark and his team arrive at her hotel, but they find the room is empty. Diana goes {{to the hospital to}} see Paul, he tries to call for help, but he is <b>too</b> <b>weak.</b> Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance of the room.|$|E
25|$|The coroner {{reported}} that David Castor {{had committed suicide}} through a self-administered lethal dose of antifreeze, but when police found Stacey Castor's fingerprints on the antifreeze glass and located a turkey baster that had David Castor's DNA on the tip, they began to suspect Stacey Castor had engineered her husband's death. They believed Castor had used the turkey baster to force-feed him once he became <b>too</b> physically <b>weak.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Going on splendidly," [...] replied his {{companion}} in the heartiest voice. [...] "You see, {{these people were}} much <b>too</b> tired and <b>weak</b> even to join the social war. They were a definite hindrance to it." ...|$|R
50|$|One {{concern about}} {{recycling}} {{wood pulp paper}} is that the fibers are degraded with each and after being recycled {{four or five times}} the fibers become <b>too</b> short and <b>weak</b> to be useful in making paper.|$|R
