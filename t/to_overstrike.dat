50|$|Some {{typewriters}} have non-spacing keys used as diacritical marks. After the typist pushes, say, acute accent ◌́ the caret {{does not}} move. This allows the typist <b>to</b> <b>overstrike</b> this mark by a spacing letter, say, e and obtain é, an accented letter. Due to geometrical restrictions of a monospaced font, {{the result could}} not always be perfect. For example, overstriking unlikely was a feasible method to produce uppercase accented letters, such as É.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the last}} sestertii were struck by Aurelian (270-275 AD). During {{the end of its}} issue, when sestertii were reduced in size and quality, the double sestertius was issued first by Trajan Decius (249-251 AD) and later in large {{quantity}} by the ruler of a breakaway regime in the West, named Postumus (259-268 AD), who often used worn old sestertii <b>to</b> <b>overstrike</b> his image and legends on. The double sestertius was distinguished from the sestertius by the radiate crown worn by the emperor, a device used to distinguish the dupondius from the as and the Antoninianus from the denarius.|$|E
50|$|The double sestertius {{was a large}} Roman coin made of {{orichalcum}} (brass) {{first issued}} by Trajan Decius in AD 249-251, {{as a response to}} the inflationary pressures of the time which had devalued the buying power of the conventional sestertius. In reality the new coin was little bigger than the traditional sestertius, which by then was being manufactured at a lower weight and smaller size than it had originally been, and was not a success. The new coin fell out of use but was revived by the rebel emperor Postumus (259-268), who ruled a breakaway empire consisting of Britain, Gaul and parts of Germany, and was keen to associate his regime with a reformed coinage system. Postumus issued his own version of the double sestertius, often taking very worn old sestertii and using these <b>to</b> <b>overstrike</b> his own portrait and legends on, probably because of a shortage of metal. After his reign, the Roman coinage system degenerated further with almost the only circulating pieces being very debased double-denarius coins, known to us as antoninianii or 'radiates' (from the use of the radiate crown). Older coins like the sestertius soon dropped entirely out of use, with many being melted down to create new radiates. By the fourth century AD even these had been discontinued and an entirely new coinage system had been created.|$|E

40|$|Density {{distribution}} sunflower plots {{are used}} to display high-density bivariate data. They are useful for data where a conventional scatter plot is difficult to read due <b>to</b> <b>overstriking</b> of the plot symbol. The x-y plane is subdivided into a lattice of regular hexagonal bins of width w specified by the user. The user also specifies the values of l, d, and k that affect the plot as follows. Indi-vidual observations are plotted when there are less than l observations per bin as in a conventional scatter plot. Each bin with from l to d observations contains a light sunflower. Other bins contain a dark sunflower. In a light sunflower each petal represents one observation. In a dark sunflower, each petal represents k observations. (A dark sunflower with p petals represents between / 2 -pk k and / 2 +pk k observations.) The user can control the sizes and colors of the sunflow-ers. By selecting appropriate colors and sizes for the light and dark sunflowers, plots can be ob-tained that give both the overall sense of the data density distribution {{as well as the}} number of data points in any given region. The use of this graphic is illustrated with data from the Framingham Heart Study. A documented Stata program, called sunflower, is available to draw these graphs.

40|$|Density-distribution {{sunflower}} plots {{are used}} to display high-density bivariate data. They are useful for data where a conventional scatterplot is difficult to read due <b>to</b> <b>overstriking</b> of the plot symbol. The x – y plane is subdivided into a lattice of small, regular, hexagonal bins. These bins are divided into low-, medium-, and high-density groups. In low-density bins, the individual observations are plotted as in a conventional scatterplot. Medium- and high-density bins contain light and dark sunflowers, respectively. In a light sunflower, each petal represents one observation. In a dark sunflower, each petal represents a specific number of observations. The user can control the sizes and colors of the sunflowers. By selecting appropriate colors and sizes for the light and dark sunflowers, plots can be obtained that give both the overall sense of the data-density distribution, {{as well as the}} number of data points in any given region. Sunflower plots are also contrasted with contour plots of bivariate kernel- density estimates. The appearance of these plots is markedly affected by the choice of smoothing parameters and the spacing of points at which the probability density function is evaluated. Sunflower plots can be helpful in guiding the se- lection of these parameters and in distinguishing between chance and systematic variation in the distribution of bivariate data.

40|$|The Southern Durchmusterung (SD, Schoenfeld 1886, Becker 1949, Schmidt 1967) is {{a visual}} survey {{of stars in}} the {{declination}} zones - 02 to - 23 deg, completed as an extension to Argelander's (1859 - 62) monumental Bonner Durchmusterung (BD). Schoenfeld's survey was carried out using the same methods as had been used for the BD. The procedure consisted of allowing the telescope to drift along the mean declination of each zone and recording the positions and magnitudes of stars crossing the transit line of each field. The goal of the survey was to extend the BD to declination - 23 deg (a plan originally adopted by Argelander) with approximately the same magnitude limits, although the primary instrument was of larger aperture (159 mm) than the 78 -mm telescope used for the BD. Thus, whereas the BD magnitude estimates extend to 9. 4 mag with all fainter stars assigned a magnitude of 9. 5, the SD magnitude estimates extend to 9. 9 mag with all fainter stars assigned a magnitude of 10. The SD contains a number of stars fainter than 10. 0 mag and even some as faint as 11 mag. Lists of all corrections made to the original data {{as a result of}} published corrigenda, stars deleted according <b>to</b> <b>overstriking</b> in the printed catalogs or their inclusion in lists of 'missing' stars, and stars inserted in later editions are given. No other corrections or changes have been incorporated into the original data, e. g., from more modern positions and magnitudes or from comparison with other catalogs...|$|R
50|$|In May 2010, Ted Price said Insomniac Games {{were at work}} on a {{multiplatform}} {{game for}} both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. On June 6, 2011, during Electronic Arts' press conference at E3 2011, that game was revealed <b>to</b> be called <b>Overstrike</b> with a trailer and a short appearance and synopsis from Price. On August 31, 2012, the game was revealed to have been reworked and rebranded as Fuse. The game was developed at their main studio in Burbank, California, and was published as part of the EA Partners program for the aforementioned platforms. This marks the first time the developer was to own its own IP, as well as the first time they released a game with a publisher other than Sony Computer Entertainment since Universal Interactive Studios.|$|R
5000|$|Boulton helped {{deal with}} the {{shortage}} of silver, persuading the Government <b>to</b> let him <b>overstrike</b> the Bank of England's large stock of Spanish dollars with an English design. The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by countermarking the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small image of George III, but the public was reluctant to accept them, {{in part due to}} counterfeiting. This attempt inspired the couplet, [...] "The Bank to make their Spanish Dollars pass/Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an ass." [...] Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking. Though Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped (high quality fakes arrived at the Bank's offices within days of the issuance), these coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver coin in 1816, when Boulton's were withdrawn. He oversaw the final issue of his coppers for Britain in 1806, and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in Ireland. Even as his health failed, he had his servants carry him from Soho House to the Soho Mint, and he sat and watched the machinery,which was kept exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost 90,000,000 pieces for the East India Company. He wrote, [...] "Of all the mechanical subjects I ever entered upon, there is none in which I ever engaged with so much ardour as that of bringing to perfection the art of coining." ...|$|R
40|$|Two silver coins of Catana {{found on}} the Rocca d’Entella, a litra of 408 (?) and a drachm of 406 / 405 BC, are {{published}} in this contribution for the first time. They are not overstrikes, but silver coins of Catana, Naxus and Rhegium, {{as well as a}} single specimen of Athens were used as flans for the production of the first silver coins of the Campani in Entella. These were drachms and hemidrachms, so far all from collections or from the market, issued in large quantities in {{the last decade of the}} fifth century BC for military purposes by the authorities of the Chalcidian cities in the area of Etna and of Rhegium. Over recent years various studies have been dedicated <b>to</b> these <b>overstrikes</b> taking into account the written sources dealing with the Campanians of Entella, yet their authors have come up with different chronologies. This article assembles all overstruck specimens, eleven in total. The date of the overstrikes is considered in the light of a new specimen from the market whose undertype is the last issue of Catana before its occupation by Dionysius I in 403 / 402 BC according to Diodorus (14. 15. 1 - 3), yet more likely around 401 / 400 BC according the overall context of his account. The conclusion is that, after this event, when Dionysius also granted to the Campanians the city of Catana as their dwelling place (Diodorus 14. 15. 3), the coins were brought by a group of Campanians to Entella where in 404 BC another group of Campani had settled after being released by Dionysius from his service (Diodorus 14. 9. 8 - 9). The coins were part of booty or pay only ―it is uncertain if ransom money was involved ―and were overstruck in Entella. Since both drachms and hemidrachms were produced from two obverse and two reverse dies, the quantity cannot have been very large and may have covered e. g. the pay of a group of 600 warriors engaged for 100 days. Hemilitra and bronze coins were also produced, the latter from fresh bullion. They are studied and, with the drachms and hemidrachms, discussed within the framework of the other coin finds from the Rocca d’Entella, and of Sicilian coinage issued in the late fifth century BC. Both the metrology of the bronzes (inspired by those of the Chalcidian cities) and the iconography of the horse on all denominations (inspired from Dionysius’gold coins which also inspired the Punic tetradrachms of Jenkins’series 1, latter part) attest to further influence from eastern Sicily. Overall, the coins raise fundamental questions related to the creation of the Campanian community’s institutional organisation and on the process of how to equip the city with monetary instruments and use them also as a tool of propaganda...|$|R
