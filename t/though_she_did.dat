5|$|Napoleon and Marie Louise {{remained}} married {{until his}} death, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{join him in}} exile on Elba and thereafter never saw her husband again. The couple had one child, Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles (1811–1832), known from birth as the King of Rome. He became Napoleon II in 1814 and reigned for only two weeks. He was awarded {{the title of the}} Duke of Reichstadt in 1818 and died of tuberculosis aged 21, with no children.|$|E
5|$|USS South Carolina (BB-26), {{the lead}} ship {{of her class}} of {{dreadnought}} battleships, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be {{named in honor of}} the eighth state. She was also the first American dreadnought; <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not incorporate turbine propulsion like , South Carolinas design included revolutionary aspects as well, primarily the superfiring arrangement of her main battery. The ship was laid down in December 1906 and launched in July 1908 before being commissioned into the US Atlantic Fleet in March 1910.|$|E
5|$|During {{the annual}} fleet {{maneuvers}} in SeptemberOctober 1907, Lepanto was present to carry {{observers of the}} exercises, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not directly {{take part in the}} training. At the start of the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, Lepanto was assigned to the 5th Division of the Italian fleet, along with her sister Italia and the ironclad Enrico Dandolo. In December 1911, Lepanto and Italia were sent to Tripoli, replacing the three s, to support the Italian garrison that had captured the city. The two Italias were sent in large part because the Italian Navy had a large stockpile of 17-inch shells. Lepanto was stricken on 26 May 1912, but was reinstated on 13 January 1913 as a first-class auxiliary ship. She was stricken a second time on 15 January 1914, sold for scrap on 27 March 1915, and subsequently broken up.|$|E

5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E
5|$|Sankt Georg {{served in}} the {{training}} and reserve squadrons during her peacetime career, usually alternating with Kaiser Karl VI. In AprilMay 1907, Sankt Georg participated in the Jamestown Exposition in the United States, to commemorate the first English colony in North America. During World War I, the Austro-Hungarian fleet largely remained inactive as a fleet in being, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> bombard the Italian coast in May 1915 following the latter's declaration of war on Austria-Hungary. In 1917, she supported the Austro-Hungarian forces that raided the Otranto Barrage; in the ensuing Battle of the Strait of Otranto, Sankt Georgs arrival on the scene was sufficient to force the Anglo-Italian forces to break off the engagement and retreat.|$|E

5|$|She saw {{relatively}} {{limited service}} during the war, {{due to her}} commissioning late in the conflict. She was present during a brief engagement with British light forces in August 1917, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not actively participate in the battle. She joined the large task force assigned to Operation Albion in October 1917, but did not see significant action during that operation either. She was assigned to what {{was to have been}} the final sortie of the High Seas Fleet in the closing days of the war, but a large-scale mutiny in significant parts of the fleet forced the cancellation of the plan. Karlsruhe was interned in Scapa Flow {{after the end of the}} war, and scuttled there on 21 June 1919. Unlike most of the other ships sunk there, her wreck was never raised.|$|E
5|$|Brummer {{was ready}} for service with the fleet by May 1916, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not steam {{with the rest of}} the High Seas Fleet for the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month. Despite the fact that they had been built as minelaying cruisers, Brummer and Bremse were never used in this capacity. In the autumn of 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the chief of the Admiralstab, decided to {{supplement}} the U-boat campaign with surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia. In addition to damaging British shipping, Scheer sought to divert escorts from the Atlantic theater, where his U-boats were concentrated. Brummer, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Leonhardi, and Bremse, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Westerkamp, were selected for the first such operation. Their high speed and large radius of action, coupled with their resemblance to British light cruisers, made them suited to the task. In preparation for the raid, their crews painted the ships dark gray to further camouflage them as British vessels.|$|E
5|$|España was {{the only}} member of the class {{completed}} by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not see action, as Spain remained neutral for the duration of the war. In August 1914, she participated in the opening ceremonies for the Panama Canal. Alfonso XIII joined her in August 1915 in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. In late 1921, Jaime I was finally completed. Throughout the early 1920s, the three ships served in the Training Squadron. During this period, Spain became involved in the Rif War in Morocco; all three ships saw action during the conflict, primarily by providing artillery support to Spanish ground forces engaging the Rif rebels. In August 1923, while bombarding Rif positions, España ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas. A lengthy salvage operation failed to free the ship, and in November 1924, the stress of repeated tidal battering broke the wreck in half.|$|E

5|$|Italy had {{declared}} neutrality {{at the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. She continued to serve as a minelayer during the war in support of Revel's strategy. She was officially reclassified as a minelayer on 1 July 1921, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not remain in service for very long, being stricken from the naval register on 4 March 1923 and thereafter broken up for scrap. At the time of her disposal, Tripoli was the last torpedo cruiser still in the Italian fleet's inventory, surpassing even the , which had been built fifteen years after Tripoli entered service.|$|E
5|$|Nautilus was {{transferred}} to the Baltic in 1916, and took part in Operation Albion in 1917, where she supported the conquest of the Gulf of Riga. In 1918, she was modified to support amphibious operations, with her 8.8cm guns replaced by a host of smaller weapons. She was assigned to the Sonderverband tasked with supporting the White Finns during the Finnish Civil War, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not see action. Instead, she spent the remainder of the war patrolling in the eastern Baltic. After the war ended in November 1918, Nautilus was demilitarized according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and hulked; she was renamed Hulk I and later Hulk A, eventually being scrapped in 1928. Albatross, meanwhile, had been refloated by a Swedish salvage company in July 1915 and interned {{for the rest of the}} war. She was returned in 1919, stricken from the naval register and scrapped that year.|$|E
