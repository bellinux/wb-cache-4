5|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010, <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> {{acquired}} the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's {{desire to be a}} director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> had a darker side. <b>The</b> <b>actor</b> also has plans to direct a film version of William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Dec. 2010: 286–88 The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In late 2013 Franco starred in This Is the End as a fictionalized version of himself stuck in a house with Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, also fictionalized versions of themselves, when the Apocalypse happens.|$|E

Parker also met with Mickey Rourke, who expressed a strong interest in playing Angel and secured the leading role after a meeting with Parker in New York.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. <b>The</b> <b>actor</b> {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him {{what it was like}} to work with him.

40|$|Encoding {{observed}} action {{according to}} its hierarchical, goal-subgoal structure {{makes it easier to}} learn, and leads learners to orient objects and actions from <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> spatial perspective. <b>The</b> present pair of studies tested whether adopting <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> perspective during encoding leads observers to encode actions more hierarchically. Participants observed and segmented an action sequence that they later performed. In Study 1, participants described the action of each segment as they segmented, either from <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> perspective or from their own. In Study 2, participants described the action from <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> perspective or {{from the perspective of a}} passive observer in the scene. In both studies, participants who described the actions from <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> perspective segmented more hierarchically and learned more effectively. Encoding actions from <b>the</b> <b>actor’s</b> perspective thus enhances understanding of goal-subgoal organization...|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> engaged in conflicts is summarized {{with great care}} in the grid of the variables used. Once the credible engagement of an actor has been identified, one can, indeed, distinguish <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> {{that are at the}} origin of this action (<b>the</b> protesting <b>actors)</b> from those which this action targets (<b>the</b> disputed <b>actors).</b>|$|R
50|$|Orders for <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> {{appear on}} a large screen for {{the public in the}} hall, while for the viewers they will be shown with subtitles.

5|$|A retired {{military}} operative {{on a mission}} to save his old teammates. The character's name is an homage to the 1978 action film Good Guys Wear Black, where Norris plays John T. Booker. During the film, Booker claims to have been bitten by a cobra and states that the cobra later died as a result; this is a reference to Chuck Norris facts, satirical factoids about <b>the</b> <b>actor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{script was}} outlined, yet {{completely}} improvised by <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> with <b>the</b> director often giving <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> a free hand.

5|$|All serials in {{this season}} {{continue}} directly one after the other, tracing one single problematic voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is considered its own standalone story. This season also introduced the character of Harry Sullivan as a companion; this character was intended to undertake action scenes, during the period prior to Tom Baker being cast, when it was unclear how old <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> playing the new Doctor would be.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 18th century, between 1716 and 1719, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, author of The Rape of the Lock, lived in Chiswick – in the {{building}} which is now the Mawson Arms {{at the corner of}} Mawson Lane.

50|$|At a {{panel on}} acting at the Telluride Film Festival, <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> spoke of <b>the</b> {{challenge}} {{of working in}} a two-camera system. Unlike traditionally shot and cut films, <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> knew that all moments of a take could end up on screen and thus acted through every take. <b>The</b> <b>actors</b> were constantly in the moment. The resulting film presents <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> work in <b>the</b> way musicians play in a duet, with action, dialogue and reaction running {{on both sides of}} the frame in real time. The movie presents two remarkable achievements in screen acting.|$|R
5|$|An {{abbreviated}} {{and less}} profane {{version of the}} speech became iconic thanks to the 1970 movie Patton, where it was performed by <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> George C.

5|$|Another {{lawsuit was}} filed by a South Carolina {{resident}} {{who said he}} was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown Columbia, with <b>the</b> <b>actor</b> allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver.

Edward’s other classmates included (King) Hussein of Jordan, and the Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers would progress to their becoming ministers, prime ministers, and leading businessmen in their respective countries.|$|E
40|$|Although {{blushing}} after {{a social}} infraction can {{function as a}} remedial gesture, people generally consider blushing as an undesirable response. To address this apparent inconsistency, we tested the idea that blushing has remedial properties after clear-cut antecedent behaviors, but can undermine <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> image in ambiguous situations. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 49) read vignettes referring to prototypical mishaps, transgressions, and ambiguous situations. In Experiment 2 (N = 58), we specifically varied <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> intentionality while keeping <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> behavior constant. In support of its alleged face-saving properties, blushing had remedial effects after obvious mishaps and voluntary transgressions. However, in ambiguous social situations and after transgressions that are ambiguous with respect to <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> intentionality, blushing undermined <b>the</b> <b>actor's</b> trustworthiness...|$|R
500|$|This {{freedom was}} complemented by filming without {{rehearsal}} and without extensive blocking. Camera operators {{were trained to}} follow <b>the</b> <b>actors,</b> rather than having <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> stand in one place with cameras fixed around them. <b>The</b> <b>actors</b> knew that <b>the</b> filming would work around them. Executive producer Jeffrey Reiner described this method as [...] "no rehearsal, no blocking, just three cameras and we shoot." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>actors</b> {{underwent}} acting {{workshops for}} a couple of months before filming commenced.
