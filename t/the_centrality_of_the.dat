5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five {{psychological and physical}} aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that {{does not apply to}} anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E

While this is an intuitive way to think about which subjects might be better connected, it yields a practical problem—how do we simultaneously estimate <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> all subjects in <b>the</b> network? Let aij equal 1 if subjects i and j have a social connection and 0 if they do not. Furthermore, let x be a vector <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> scores so that each subject’s centrality j x is proportional to <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects to whom they are connected: λ x = a x + a x +! + a x.

25|$|The Church of South India was {{the first}} modern Episcopal uniting church, {{consisting}} as it did, from its foundation in 1947, {{at the time of}} Indian independence, of Anglicans, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Reformed Christians. Its liturgy, from the first, combined the free use of Cranmer's language with an adherence to the principles of congregational participation and <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist, much in line with the Liturgical Movement. Because it was a minority church of widely differing traditions in a non-Christian culture (except in Kerala, where Christianity has a long history), practice varied wildly.|$|E

25|$|Although analogies {{have been}} drawn between Buddhism and Christianity, there are {{differences}} between the two religions beginning with monotheism's place at the core of Christianity, and Buddhism's orientation towards non-theism (the lack of relevancy of the existence of a creator deity) which runs counter to teachings about God in Christianity; and extending to the importance of grace in Christianity against the rejection of interference with karma in Theravada Buddhism, etc. Another difference between the two traditions is the Christian belief in <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crucifixion of Jesus as a single event that some believe acts as the atonement of sins, and its direct contrast to Buddhist teachings.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-seventeenth {{century that}} Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to {{maintain}} until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century. The adoption of the Westminster Directory in 1643 meant that the Scots adopted the English Puritan dislike of set forms of worship. The recitation of the Creed, Lord's Prayer, Ten Commandments and Doxology were abandoned in favour of the lengthy sermon of the lecture. <b>The</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sermon meant that services tended to have a didactic and wordy in character. The only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line {{and it was then}} repeated by the congregation.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Ratzinger was {{appointed}} to a chair in dogmatic theology at the University of Tübingen, {{where he was a}} colleague of Hans Küng. In his 1968 book Introduction to Christianity, he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the Marxist leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{triangular}} flow in ultrarelativistic 3 He–Au collisions at RHIC energies {{is enhanced}} due to <b>the</b> triangular arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nucleon configurations in 3 He. We study the fireball eccentricities in the Glauber Monte Carlo model {{and find that}} since <b>the</b> configurations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> projectile 3 He are elongated triangles, the created fireball has not only a significant triangularity but also a large ellipticity. <b>The</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangularity on <b>centrality</b> is weak, so it cannot be extracted from <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangular flow v 3, as it is dominated by <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrodynamic response. We propose to look at <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ratio vn{ 4 }/vn{ 2 }, where the uncertainties from the hydrodynamic response cancel, and show that <b>the</b> basic signature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geometry-driven collective flow is <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ratio v 3 { 4 }/v 3 { 2 } with <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> participant nucleons for centralities less than 10 %...|$|R
30|$|SNA {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point {{the notion that}} KTO 1 is <b>the</b> central node <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network. This SNA points to what is designated as an egocentric network in the literature (Marsden 2002), mapping the relations around a focal agent—the ego. This understanding is highly connected to <b>the</b> ANT assumption <b>of</b> obligatory points <b>of</b> passage in <b>the</b> TH relations in its context <b>of</b> action. <b>The</b> central actor is KTO 1, and <b>the</b> <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other actors have a relative understanding to the office as an obligatory point of passage.|$|R

500|$|Zionist ideologue A. D.

In Zionist thought, the chavrusa is [...] "a central tool in the struggle for the revival of the Jewish people, the revival of the individual, and <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea of 'labor'.

500|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} while {{each of the}} schools of thought he has {{considered}} has problems, they all have something important {{to contribute to the}} debate. Utilitarianism's most important contribution is its focus on sentience, but its major failing is its lack of respect for individuals. Liberalism, on the other hand, asserts <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual. Communitarianism, though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society, observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities, and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large. This latter idea is shared by Marxism, which points out that legal change does not necessarily equate to effective change. While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown, he recognises that [...] "fundamental shifts in the organisation, norms and institutions of society" [...] are needed for justice to be extended to animals. Care-based feminist approaches, despite Cochrane's criticism, remind us that emotions and sympathy should not be ignored.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{there will}} be many {{different}} eigenvalues [...] for which a non-zero eigenvector solution exists. Since the entries in the adjacency matrix are non-negative, there is a unique largest eigenvalue, which is real and positive, by the Perron–Frobenius theorem. This greatest eigenvalue results in <b>the</b> desired <b>centrality</b> measure. <b>The</b> [...] component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> related eigenvector then gives <b>the</b> relative <b>centrality</b> score <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertex [...] in the network. The eigenvector is only defined up to a common factor, so only <b>the</b> ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>centralities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertices are well defined. To define an absolute score one must normalise the eigen vector e.g. such that the sum over all vertices is 1 or <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> vertices n. Power iteration is one of many eigenvalue algorithms that may be used to find this dominant eigenvector. Furthermore, this can be generalized so that the entries in A can be real numbers representing connection strengths, as in a stochastic matrix.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{to compare}} <b>the</b> <b>centrality</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{different}} communities, the average {{deviation from the}} maximum score {{was derived from the}} ratio between <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deviation <b>of</b> each modality and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> modalities included in each community.|$|R
