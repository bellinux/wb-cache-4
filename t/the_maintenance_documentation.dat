However, 84 of the 90 windscreen retention bolts were 0.026 in too small in diameter, while the remaining six were 0.1 in too short. The investigation revealed that the previous windscreen had been fitted with incorrect bolts, which had been replaced on a [...] "like for like" [...] basis by the shift maintenance manager without reference to <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>documentation,</b> in order to save time as the plane was due to take off soon and there was a tight schedule. The air pressure difference between the cabin and the outside during the flight proved to be too much, leading to the failure of the windscreen. The incident also brought to attention a design flaw in the aircraft of the windscreen being secured from the outside of the aircraft, putting a greater pressure on the bolts than if they were secured from the inside.|$|E

The first study is based on the observations and interviews of the maintenance operators during their task; the second study concerns ergonomic inspection of the documentation based on ergonomic criteria about structure and content. The two results confirm the problem linked to the information presentation (characters size, bad quality of figures, etc.) and structure and allow also concluding that aircraft maintenance documentation must be improved by the use of more efficient text signals in order to make easier the use the documentation at the work place and to avoid maintenance errors...|$|E

One commonly accepted means to address this challenge and further enhance survivability is enterprise architecture (EA) management, which provides a holistic model-based approach to business/IT alignment. Thereby, the decisions taken {{in the context of}} EA management are based on accurate documentation of IT systems and business processes. <b>The</b> <b>maintenance</b> of such <b>documentation</b> causes high investments for enterprises, especially in the absence of information on the change rates of different systems and processes. In this paper we propose a method for gathering and analyzing such information. The method is used to analyze the life spans of the application portfolio of three companies from different industry sectors.

40|$|The HRZ {{archives}} of conservation-restoration documentation show the continuity from 1916 till the present day. A Zagreb’s restorer Ferdo Goglia {{started with a}} consistent documentation of the condition of paintings and restoration treatments in detail. His documentation was based on consistent written records but Goglia used photography and diagrams whenever he considered them as necessary illustration tools. By {{the end of his}} working life, i. e. 1941, Goglia treated and documented 1792 paintings. The regulations on <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of records relating to conservation-restoration works in Croatia were passed by authorites in Vienna in 1853. The enactment of these regulations was not encouraged by the restoration experts themselves, but its reasons lied in the intention of the state authorities to monitor restorations and state expenses. Consequently, these records only sometimes present the state of preservation or treatment proposals in detail. According to the literature, the first professional guidelines for conservationrestoration documenting were published in the journal Museoin in 1932, while the authoritative Ruhemann’s and Stout’s articles were published in the journal Technical Studies in 1934 and 1935. However, <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of such <b>documentation</b> was not obligatory part of the discipline until the mid sixties of the 20 th century. Looking at Goglia’s documentation in wider context it is possible to conclude that his documentation is ahead of his time.

40|$|International audienceTwo major {{problems}} appear during {{the design of}} a framework. The ﬁrst is related to synthesizing generic elements for a family of applications and connecting them to an integrated control ﬂow. The second lies in {{the design of a}} powerful, modular, reliable architecture that is easy to (re) use and understand. The fact of including design patterns in the architecture of frameworks minimizes the second problem. Indeed, design patterns provide proven, ﬂexible, well-engineered design solutions at a higher abstraction level than classes. Their associated documentation records information from experienced object-oriented designers about solutions to recurrent problems, about contexts in which the patterns are applicable, about forces involved and consequences related to their use. This paper presents a number of the beneﬁts of integrating design patterns in the development of an object-oriented framework related to fuzzy logic control.

40|$|Currently, task support {{information}} in aircraft maintenance is mostly provided using paper-based solutions, which are burdensome, slow {{and prone to}} error. Aircraft <b>maintenance</b> <b>documentation</b> contains vast amounts of information irrelevant for {{the task at hand}} and even for the simplest tasks multiple documents need to be consulted. Next to these issues with <b>the</b> <b>documentation</b> itself, Aircraft <b>Maintenance</b> Technicians (AMTs) have very limited on-site access to support information. These factors lead to 15 – 20 % of hands-on-aircraft time being wasted on acquiring the right information or not using <b>maintenance</b> <b>documentation</b> for task support at all, risking maintenance error.

40|$|Building proper {{reaction}} mechanisms {{is crucial}} to model the system dynamic properties for many industrial processes with complex chemical reaction phenomena. Because {{of the complexity of}} a reaction mechanism, computer-aided reaction mechanism generation software appeared in recent years to help people efficiently build large reaction mechanisms. However, the limitations of those programs, such as not being able to model different types of reaction systems and to provide sufficiently precise thermodynamic and kinetic parameters impede their broad usage in real reaction system modeling. Targeting the drawbacks in current first-generation reaction modeling software, this thesis presents the second-generation of reaction mechanism construction software, Reaction Mechanism Generator, (RMG). In RMG, a new reaction template method is proposed to help quickly and flexibly define different types of reaction families, so that users can easily characterize any reaction system of interest without modifying the software. Furthermore, this work also presents new functional group tree approaches to construct hierarchical structured thermodynamics and kinetics databases for managing a large number of parameters, so that people are able to quickly and precisely identify better kinetics for different reactions in the same reaction family and to easily extend and update the databases with the latest research results. This new data-model dramatically improves the interface between the chemistry and computer science, removing many of the ambiguities that have plagued the field of chemical kinetics for many years, and greatly facilitating <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> and <b>documentation</b> of both the software and the databases that provide the key inputs to any chemical kinetic model. (cont.) The author applied object-oriented technology and unified modeling language in system analysis, architecture design, and implementation of RMG. Therefore it is designed and developed into a robust software with good architecture and detailed documentation, so that this software can be easily maintained, reused, and extended. RMG is successfully applied to generate a reaction mechanism for n-butane low temperature oxidation, which includes a complex autoignition process. The model generated by RMG caught the fundamental phenomena of autoignition, and the predicted ignition delay time and many major products' yields are in very good agreement with experimental data. This {{is the first time that}} model generation software automatically generated such a complicated reaction mechanism without human interference, and provided precise predictions on ignition delay and major products yields consistent with experimental data. by Jing Song.
