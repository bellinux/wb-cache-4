5|$|In {{its largest}} market, the U.S., the Lexus LS was the top-selling {{flagship}} luxury sedan for 15 {{of the first}} 17 years following its debut. In Japan, the next-largest market for the Lexus LS, {{the introduction of the}} 2007 LS 460 attracted 12,000 pre-orders, and the Lexus LS has gone on to sell successfully in its class. Following the introduction of the LS 460 and Lexus' expanded global launch in 2007, sales of the Lexus flagship have increasingly come from outside the brand's traditional U.S. strongholds. By 2007, the Lexus LS ranked second globally in flagship sales, next to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class' 85,500 units, with 71,760 Lexus LS sedans sold worldwide, and over half the total coming from outside the U.S. market.
