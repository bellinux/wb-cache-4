40|$|Skripsie (MEd (Vergelykende Opvoedkunde)) [...] PU vir CHO, 1997 The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system <b>of</b> Botswana after independence. This period starts from the 30 th September 1966, when Botswana became independent {{up to the present}} moment. Since then <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system has undergone many changes. Consequently {{the focus is on the}} nature and impact of these changes. The study identifies changes which took place with regard to <b>the</b> <b>Education</b> System <b>of</b> Botswana since independence as far as meeting <b>the</b> minimum requirements <b>of</b> <b>education</b> <b>of</b> developing countries are concerned. The minimum requirements that <b>the</b> <b>education</b> systems <b>of</b> developing countries, must meet are discussed according to the four central components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> systems, viz. <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system policy, education system administration, structure for teaching and support services. After introducing the problem statement and background in the introductory chapter, <b>the</b> minimum requirements <b>of</b> <b>education</b> systems in developing countries are discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 then deals with a historical perspective on <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system <b>of</b> Botswana before independence, concentrating on the different historical periods associated with educational development up to independence day. The study then discusses <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system <b>of</b> Botswana after independence in Chapter 4, focussing on the particular factors influencing <b>the</b> Botswana <b>education</b> system. Finally, Chapter 5 evaluates the level to which <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system policy and <b>education</b> system administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system <b>of</b> Botswana meet the minimum requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> systems <b>of</b> developing countries, while Chapter 6 evaluates the level to which the structure for teaching and support services meet the minimum requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> systems <b>of</b> developing countries. In general, the evaluation indicates that <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system <b>of</b> Botswana has undergone many positive changes and that <b>the</b> Botswana <b>education</b> system compares favourably with the minimum requirements expected <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> systems <b>of</b> developing countries.

5|$|After touring {{with her}} former group Fugees, Hill became {{involved}} in a romantic relationship with Jamaican entrepreneur Rohan Marley, and shortly after, became pregnant with his child.

Primarily a neo soul album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill incorporates musical styles from R, hip hop, soul, and reggae.
