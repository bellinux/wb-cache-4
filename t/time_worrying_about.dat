25|$|When Birt gets up {{and says}} {{the whole of the}} BBC was a {{creative}} mess and it was wasteful, I never saw any evidence of that. I absolutely know it wasn't so in my time. Producers now spend all their <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> money, and the thing has suffered for it.|$|E
500|$|Petra Boynton, a British {{scientist}} {{who has written}} extensively on the G-spot debate, is also concerned about the promotion of the G-spot leading women to feel [...] "dysfunctional" [...] if they do not experience it. [...] "We're all different. Some women will have a certain area within the vagina which will be very sensitive, and some won't— but they won't necessarily be in the area called the G spot," [...] she stated. [...] "If a woman spends all her <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> whether she is normal, or has a G spot or not, she will focus on just one area, and ignore everything else. It's telling people that there is a single, best way to have sex, which isn't the right thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E

50|$|From another patient, {{he learns}} that Champillon has changed hands four <b>times.</b> <b>Worried</b> <b>about</b> Melisande, Jim sneaks {{out of the}} {{hospital}} and hitches a ride. When he gets to the farmhouse, he finds it damaged and empty. Melisande and her mother have joined a stream of refugees. Jim collapses and is carried off in an ambulance by retreating soldiers.|$|R
30|$|When {{data are}} {{available}} only on agents and the reference groups to which they belong, researchers have for some <b>time</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> how social effects might be identified. However, when detailed data on nodes and their individual links are present, identification of social effects (taking the network as conditionally exogenous) is generic, and estimation is relatively straightforward. Three broader conceptual issues exist in this case.|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the point of {{divergence}} of A Different Flesh being set before human history makes the novel a proper alternate history {{or some sort of}} [...] "alternative natural history", [...] Turtledove responded: [...] "They seem like alternate history to me, but I haven't really spent a whole lot of <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> how to classify them, I'm afraid." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Birt's predecessors, Alasdair Milne, said Birt {{did little}} {{good for the}} BBC apart from {{establishing}} its internet service and criticised him for paying consultants large fees for the corporation's restructuring. [...] Many others opposed Birt, his methods and his reforms, including the journalists John Tusa, Mark Tully and Charles Wheeler, and news correspondent Kate Adie. Radio broadcaster John Dunn believed morale was bad under Birt, while David Attenborough commented that producers spend too much <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> money {{as a result of}} Birt’s reforms.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, Fatih Birol, {{the chief}} {{economist}} of the International Energy Agency, described additional greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's oil sands as [...] "extremely low". The IEA forecasts {{that in the next}} 25 years oil sands production in Canada will increase by more than , but Dr. Birol said [...] "the emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of emissions of China — not even one day." [...] The IEA is charged with responsibility for battling climate change, but Dr. Birol said he spends little <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> carbon emissions from oil sands. [...] "There is a lot of discussion on oil sands projects in Canada and the United States {{and other parts of the}} world, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming from the oil sands is extremely low." [...] Dr. Birol acknowledged that there is tremendous difference of opinion on the course of action regarding climate change, but added, [...] "I hope all these reactions are based on scientific facts and sound analysis." ...|$|E
50|$|Part III {{begins with}} Peter Alden in London, where he felt strangely {{comfortable}} and at home, {{waiting for the}} arrival of Oliver and Irma. Peter arranged for Oliver to spend the first few days with Jim in Iffley and he sent Irma on to visit her old school. At the beginning of this section we see Peter, for the first <b>time,</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> his sons future. He speaks of the money that will eventually belong to Oliver, and the problems it will cause him.|$|R

Now, if you young people don't want England {{to get ahead of}} us in many ways, you must bestir yourselves and keep abreast; for our sisters are in earnest, you see, and don't waste <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> their sphere, but make it {{wherever}} duty calls them.' ...|$|E
60|$|When Jimmy Skunk shouted {{down the}} hall of Johnny Chuck's old house to Peter Rabbit that {{he would come back}} at dark, he was half joking. He did it to make Peter uneasy and to worry him. The truth is, Jimmy was no longer angry at all. He had quite {{recovered}} his good nature and was very much inclined to laugh himself over Peter's trick. But he felt that it wouldn't do to let Peter off without some kind of punishment, and so he decided to frighten Peter a little. He knew that Peter wouldn't dare come out during the daytime because of the Yellow Jackets whose home was just inside the doorway of that old house; and he knew that Peter wouldn't dare face him, for he would be afraid of being treated as Reddy Fox had been. So that is why he told Peter that he was coming back at dark. He felt that if Peter was kept a prisoner in there for a while, all the <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> how he was to get out, he would be very slow to try such a trick again.|$|E
6000|$|During {{the whole}} time that he stayed with us, we found him a very worthy, good sort of an old gentleman, though a little queer in his ways. He would keep in his room for days together, and {{if any of the}} {{children}} cried, or made a noise about his door, he would bounce out in a great passion, with his hands full of papers, and say something about [...] "deranging his ideas;" [...] which made my wife believe sometimes that he was not altogether compos. Indeed, there was more than one reason to make her think so, for his room was always covered with scraps of paper and old mouldy books, lying about at sixes and sevens, which he would never let anybody touch; for he said he had laid them all away in their proper places, so that he might know where to find them; though, for that matter, he was half his <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the house in search of some book or writing which he had carefully put out of the way. I shall never forget what a pother he once made, because my wife cleaned out his room when his back was turned, and put everything to rights; for he swore he {{would never be able to}} get his papers in order again in a twelve-month. Upon this my wife ventured to ask him, what he did with so many books and papers? and he told her, that he was [...] "seeking for immortality"; which made her think, more than ever, that the poor old gentleman's head was a little cracked.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, The Dissolve gave the film {{a rating of}} {{three and a half}} stars out of five, noting that [...] "the action moves along at such a rapid clip, there’s little <b>time</b> to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> how much the plot relies on incredible coincidences".|$|R

5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, at such a tense political <b>time,</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> what the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|R
5000|$|The Fiancée of {{the pirate}} (1969) {{is a film}} by Nelly Kaplan, where the action {{takes place in a}} hamlet where {{everyone}} spends their <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> what everyone thinks about the chef-lieu of the town.|$|E

5000|$|However, by 1963 {{the company}} was in trouble; it lost $4.3 million on {{revenues}} of $10 million. [...] The firm's lender, Security Pacific Bank, brought in Dan Burns to run the company. [...] As Burns later said, a problem with Electrada was that the management [...] "spent all of their <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> acquisitions and talking to the financial market and did not spend <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> {{how to run a}} business once they bought it."In Postley's view, the problem with Electrada had been that it [...] "was formed by areal promoter who didn't know anything except how to promote a company." [...] Regarding the famous names on its board of directors, Postley said that aside from getting the company listed on the stock exchange, [...] "none of them ever did anything at all." ...|$|E
50|$|Vincent Patilio {{was very}} proud of his son, yet at the same <b>time</b> very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> him risking his life. He even {{prevented}} his son from joining the Defenders, even when it meant publicly humiliating him by dragging him home in front of the team and the media.|$|R

The two friends {{are from the}} same village. Raja lives with his grandmother (S. N. Lakshmi) whereas Manikkam lives with his father (Thideer Kannaiah) and mother (Srimathi). Overnight, Raja starts {{to act like a}} lunatic and his behaviour is getting worse and worse over <b>time.</b> <b>Worried</b> <b>about</b> his mental health, his grandmother and Manikkam admit him in a mental hospital. Raja stays in the hospital for a week. The doctor says that his situation is improving, and that Raja can be discharged from the hospital but he is not completely recovered.|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{comparisons}} to vocalist Justin Vernon's most notable project, Bon Iver, Vernon stated, [...] "I {{read somewhere that}} people are thinking Repave sounds like another Bon Iver album, but I'm not gonna {{go out there and}} say, [...] "No, but you don't understand!" [...] because that's people's opinions. It's just so clear to me that Volcano Choir is such a band, such a new thing that came from absolutely new songs. It's such a Repave! ... It's slightly annoying, but if I spent any <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> it, I'd spend too much <b>time</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> it. A lot of that stems from the amount of import that pop music places on lead singers. For some people, that's literally all they listen to, even when you consider the history of the band." ...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} on {{long-term}} outcomes in kidney transplantation. This study evaluated changes and predictors of generic and transplantation-specific health-related {{quality of life}} (HQoL) over six years in N = 102 kidney transplant survivors using the Short-form Health Survey- 36 and the Transplant Effects questionnaire. Mixed models {{analysis was used to}} determine long-term outcomes. Emotional HQoL improved over time: Mental Component score, Mental Health, Energy (Ps =. 000). Physical HQoL deteriorated: Physical Component Score (P =. 001), Pain (P =. 002). LRD transplant recipients had greater decline in physical functioning (P =. 003) and PCS (P =. 000) compared to cadaver recipients. <b>Worry</b> <b>about</b> the transplant (P =. 036) and feelings of responsibility (P =. 008) increased significantly over <b>time.</b> <b>Worry</b> <b>about</b> the transplant and perceived ability to work predicted 12. 7 % and 31. 1 % in variance in MCS and PCS, respectively.

50|$|Jin Mikasa is {{the heir}} to the Mikasa shrine, {{currently}} seen over by his father and dedicated to Doukan-San. One day, a mysterious fox-girl called Kogane Mikasa appears at the shrine, who claims to be half-human and half-demon. She first stays with Jin and Sogo Aoyagi, a childhood friend of Jin's who is self-centered at <b>times.</b> <b>Worried</b> <b>about</b> Doukan-San discovering her, Jin and Kogane hide in Sogo's wardrobe, where they accidentally kiss. The kiss causes her to lose her fox-like appearances and turn into a human, something she has always wanted. However, the change is only temporarily and she needs to be kissed repeatedly to remain human. Also, she cannot use magic when she is human. Her fate is determined by who she marries, and she wants to marry a human and be human.|$|R
50|$|Jim Hacker is vexed at {{his lack}} of {{popularity}} within the press, and particularly at rumours of a scandal in the City.

30|$|Let us be honest: Humans love plastics. Parents {{learn about}} this when they watch their kids {{neglecting}} their beautiful, eco-friendly wooden toy train {{in favor of}} a garishly colored plastic truck made in China. But our affection with plastics runs much deeper than toy choice. With the invention of polymers, mankind transcended the limitations of natural materials regarding both their availability and properties [[2]]. One example: In 1867, The New York <b>Times</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the extinction of elephants, which were hunted for ivory, mainly needed to make billiard balls. The stagnant supply of ivory, so the story goes, fueled the search for faux ivory and finally led to the invention of celluloid in 1869. While this plastic (the term was not yet coined) was not particularly good for making billiard balls, its invention can be considered the dawn of the ‘plastic age’.|$|R
