5|$|Despite their {{electrical}} flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, {{based on}} the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as cab control cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications - six as cab cars and 8 as trailer coaches. Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some cab cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted <b>to</b> <b>technology</b> testing or track measurement cars, and one more is used by Amtrak as a special-purpose business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself <b>to</b> <b>technology</b> and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

5|$|As {{the novel}} opens, Wadzek, {{owner of a}} factory that {{produces}} steam engines, is locked in a struggle with his more powerful rival Rommel, whose much larger company manufactures turbines. He {{can be seen as}} representing a new type of entrepreneur, more technologically advanced and less scrupulous than Wadzek. Losing value, the stock of Wadzek's company is being bought up by Rommel; in desperation, Wadzek teams up with Schneemann, an engineer working at one of Rommel's factories, to thwart his company's takeover by Rommel. This effort includes the misguided theft of some of Rommel's business correspondence. Fearing legal retribution for this theft, Wadzek, accompanied by Schneemann, flees with his wife Pauline and daughter Herta to his house in Reinickendorf, where the two men fortify the house in delusional preparation for a siege that never comes. Financially and spiritually broken, Wadzek returns to Berlin and with Schneemann attempts to turn himself in at a police station, where they learn that no warrant has even been issued for their arrest. There follows a temporary reconciliation with his estranged family and the first attempts to begin a new career in education—Wadzek would instruct his students in a new, moralistic and humane approach <b>to</b> <b>technology.</b> However, after walking in on an erotically and exotically charged debauch held in his own parlor (the aftermath of an African-themed birthday party Pauline held with her two new friends from Reinickendorf), Wadzek suffers a further breakdown. The novel ends aboard a ship bound for America, Wadzek eloping with Gaby, an old acquaintance and erstwhile lover of Rommel's, to begin a new life.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling a moment in a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling <b>to</b> <b>technology</b> and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E

40|$|External {{knowledge}} {{is an important}} input for the innovation process of firms. Increasingly, this {{knowledge is}} likely to originate from outside of their national borders. This explains the preoccupation of policymakers with stimulating local technology transfers coming from international firms. We find that firms that have access <b>to</b> the international <b>technology</b> market are more likely <b>to</b> transfer <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> the local economy. In doing so, we qualify the traditional assertion that multinational firms are more likely <b>to</b> transfer <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> the local economy. Once controlled for the superior access <b>to</b> the international <b>technology</b> market that multinationals enjoy, we find that these firms are not more likely <b>to</b> transfer <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> the local economy compared to exporting or local firms that have access <b>to</b> the international <b>technology</b> market. In summary, the main result {{of this paper is}} that it is not so much the international character of the firms, but rather their access to the int [...] ...|$|R
