When individuals receive and process information, they develop memory traces that can be easily recalled to make decisions on a certain issue. Agenda-setting, in this regard, can make certain issue to be easily accessed in individual’s memory when forming judgment about the issue.|$|E

40|$|SMT-based program verifiers often {{suffer from}} the {{so-called}} butterfly effect, in which minor modifications to the program source cause significant instabilities in verification times, which in turn may lead to spurious verification failures and a degraded user experience. This paper identifies matching loops (ill-behaved quantifiers causing an SMT solver to repeatedly instantiate a small set of quantified formulas) as a significant contributor to these instabilities, and describes some techniques to detect and prevent them. At their core, the contributed techniques move the trigger selection logic away from the SMT solver and into the high-level verifier: this move allows authors of verifiers to annotate, rewrite, and analyze user-written quantifiers to improve the solver’s performance, using information <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> <b>available</b> at the source level but {{would be hard to}} extract from the heavily encoded terms that the solver works with.

The sorption capacity of algal biomass at initial concentration 100  ppm, pH 4.5 – 5 at room temperature was 62.3 which is quite fast and equilibrium reached within one hour. FTIR and SEM studies validated the interaction between various functional groups present {{on the surface of}} adsorbent and heavy metals. Biosorption data fit well to Langmuir isotherm model and partially to Freundlich. Experimental results suggest that pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics was followed by biosorption, and it seems other than intraparticle diffusion other kinetic models are also responsible for controlling the rate of reactions.  0.1  N EDTA was a good eluting agent at 55  °C temperature taking about one hour time. Regeneration also seems effective, but further assessment of economic study is needed for industrial upscaling. In this context, the development of commercial biosorbents by immobilization techniques would be very effective.|$|E

This involves associating each user to one of its reachable wireless networks; a decision that can be made on the user side, in which case inefﬁciencies stem from user selfishness.

While the so-called Pigovian taxes allow to deal with homogeneous users, we consider here two classes with different sensitivities to the Quality of Service, reflecting the dichotomy between delay-sensitive and delay-insensitive applications. We consider a geographic area covered by two wireless networks, among which users choose based on a trade-off between the quality of service and the price to pay. Using a non-atomic routing game model, we study analytically the case of constant demand levels. We show that when properly designed, the incentives elicit efficient user-network associations. Moreover, those optimal incentives can be simply computed by the wireless operator, using only some information <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> <b>available.</b> Finally, the performance of the incentive scheme under dynamic demand (users opening and closing connections over time) are investigated through simulations, our incentive scheme also yielding significant improvements in that case...|$|E
