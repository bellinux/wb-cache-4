5|$|Cranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking, but unrelated, herons, cranes {{fly with}} <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> outstretched, not pulled back. Most have {{elaborate}} and noisy courting displays.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
5|$|Herons and egrets are {{medium to}} large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. They all fly with <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> retracted. The sharp bill is used to catch fish, {{amphibians}} and other animals. Many species nest in colonies, often in trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{young males}} can be {{identified}} {{as soon as they}} display one (or more) pitch-black feathers of <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> rings and/or one (or more) pink feathers of their nape bands. Often, the young males develop <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> rings and nape bands in two or sometimes three successive moulting seasons. Adult parakeets with neither pitch-black feathers in <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> rings nor pink feathers in their nape bands are usually females.|$|R
500|$|Most storks {{fly with}} <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> outstretched, {{but the three}} Leptoptilos species retract <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> in flight as herons do, {{possibly}} due to the heavy bill. When walking on the ground, it has a stiff marching gait from which the name [...] "adjutant" [...] is derived.|$|R
50|$|An Acupressure Pillow {{is made of}} two spheres {{connected}} by a compression spring surrounded by memory foam and was invented by Steve Cohen of Newport Beach, CA with a patent pending as of March 2013. One places the pillow behind <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> and shoulder and lies on it to create pressure {{at the base of}} <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b> It has been shown that this pressure created reduces stress and possibly reduces headaches.|$|R
5|$|Other {{studies by}} Taylor find that all {{tetrapods}} appear to hold <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics {{that set the}} soft tissue anatomy of <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> apart from that of other animals. Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed {{at the level of}} the feet.|$|E
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter necked and more secretive. Members of Ardeidae fly with <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.|$|E

5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
5|$|P. l. spelaea or P. spelaea, {{known as}} the European cave lion, Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, {{occurred}} in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago. This species is known from Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts, indicating it had protruding ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes. A few had a ruff or primitive mane around <b>their</b> <b>necks,</b> possibly indicating males, but many scenes show hunting behavior (which would be the females).|$|E

50|$|Fractures and dislocations. 5% of fallers end {{up having}} a {{fracture}} {{as a result of}} their fall, and 1% fracture <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> of femur.|$|R
5000|$|War uniforms {{were often}} used as means of {{displaying}} wealth rather than functional battle purposes. The hersir was often equipped with a conical helmet and a short mail coat. The type of helmet, sword, and ringmail corselet worn by the Viking, demonstrated {{the wealth of the}} warrior. Often, a combined symbol of the cross, a hammer around <b>their</b> <b>neck,</b> accompanied with a wolf head decoration would be worn around <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b> Hersirs are typically thought to be very well groomed.|$|R
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets and bitterns. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. Members of Ardeidae fly with <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. Nine species have been recorded in Tasmania, one of which (the cattle egret) is a recent self-introduction and three others are vagrants.|$|E
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. Bitterns tend to be shorter-necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> pulled back into a curve.|$|E

5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in <b>their</b> <b>necks,</b> whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Autopsies showed {{all three}} victims had water in their lungs, proving {{they had been}} thrown into the water while still alive. Michelleidentified as the second body foundhad freed one hand from her bonds before she drowned. The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied around <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> with a concrete block {{at the other end}} to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E

50|$|Native Americans {{carried their}} knives in sheaths, either on their belts or around <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b> They often used beads, feathers, and paint to {{decorate}} their sheaths with Native American symbols.|$|R
5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{finds that}} {{the victims of the}} attack had {{implants}} in <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> and all claimed to be abductees. He believes they were led there by the military, not aliens. Mulder is called by Marita, who kidnapped Dmitri. Dmitri pulls the stitches off his eyes, resulting in Marita getting infected with the black oil. Mulder calls Cassandra, looking for Scully, but Jeffrey answers and reveals that Cassandra is gone. At that moment Cassandra is with a group of abductees, including Scully, at the Ruskin Dam, brought there by Syndicate assassin Quiet Willy. The abductees see a UFO appear in the sky. Suddenly screams are uttered as two faceless aliens arrive.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, equines, both horses and onagers, were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a yoke around <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E
50|$|These storks feed on frogs, insects, young birds, lizards and rodents. They {{fly with}} the neck outstretched, {{like most other}} storks, but unlike herons which retract <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> in flight.|$|R
