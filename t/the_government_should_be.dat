5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a {{complicated}} and hefty job. After the State President {{he was the}} most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Trained {{research}} teams {{were already on}} the ground on Java responding to the May earthquake and began a {{survey of more than}} one hundred Muslim farmers, plantation laborers, and fishermen (or those with fishing-related occupations) that were affected by the tsunami. Almost two thirds of the group reported that they lived in permanent structures made of wood, brick, or cement, while the remainder lived in semi-permanent facilities made from earth or stone. The government was cited as the first responder for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> responsible for relief. Most of those requiring aid stated that they were given effective assistance within 48 hours and that they were satisfied with the help.|$|E
25|$|Cultural issues, {{especially}} prohibition {{and foreign}} language schools became important {{because of the}} sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants (Methodists, Scandinavian Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Disciples of Christ) who believed <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used to reduce social sins, such as drinking.|$|E

25|$|In April 1979, the Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, {{overturned}} the dismissal, holding {{that the evidence}} introduced at trial supported the allegations of a conspiracy among the Chicago police, the Cook County State’s Attorney, and the FBI against the Black Panther members. The appeals court further ruled that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sanctioned for suppression of the FBI documents and that Taylor and Haas were wrongfully cited for contempt. In 1982, the case was settled for $1.85 million. It was never determined who fired the first shot at the apartment.|$|E
25|$|After the Scarman Report on {{the riots}} was published, Powell {{gave a speech}} on 10 December in the Commons. Powell {{disagreed}} with Scarman {{when he said that}} the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged: the black community was alienated because it was alien. He claimed tensions would worsen because the nonwhite population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25%, of those of secondary school age it was 40%. Powell said that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> honest to the people by telling them in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.|$|E

25|$|Cultural issues, {{especially}} prohibition {{and foreign}} language schools, became important {{because of the}} sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants who believed <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used to reduce social sins, such as drinking. Liturgical churches comprised {{over a quarter of}} the vote and wanted the government to stay out of personal morality issues. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up elections in most states over a period of decades, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (and repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the key {{measures}} that have been implemented in the 3 years since the SARS crisis ended was greatly increased commitment and leadership from the government to tackle public health problems. During the SARS epidemic, governmental and communist party leaders at all levels—from Paramount leader Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabo {{and members of the}} State Council down to village leaders—were involved in tackling a single public-health issue. The epidemic and its eventual control convinced Chinese leaders that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> much more involved in addressing public-health problems. After the SARS epidemic, the State Council developed a mechanism to oversee public-health emergencies directly. The State Council has also involved itself with other pressing public-health challenges, including HIV/AIDS, avian influenza, occupational safety, and environmental health.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Proulx {{resigned}} as Dion's Quebec lieutenant {{hours before the}} Harper government's throne speech, taking the fall for the three by-election losses. Dion first approached Montreal MPs Denis Coderre and Pablo Rodriguez to succeed Proulx, but they declined. That evening he named Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette to the vacant post. While the Party was divided {{on whether or not}} <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> toppled on a confidence vote regarding the Throne Speech, Dion mentioned in a statement in the House of Commons on 17 October that the Liberals will support the Throne Speech but with major amendments including the Kyoto Protocol and the end of mission in Afghanistan by 2009 and had criticized the government on several aspects including the economy, seniors and child poverty, the crime policy, the Senate reform. The latter amendment proposal was rejected by the New Democratic Party who are favouring an immediate end to the mission. Dion explained the decision as that Canadians are not willing to have a third election in just over three years. All Liberal members abstained from voting on the Throne Speech on 24 October 2007, which passed 126–79.|$|E

50|$|In a {{political}} context, the Roanoke Valley usually refers collectively to Roanoke City, Salem, and Roanoke County. Some governmental functions are consolidated. For example, {{there is a}} regional sewer authority and Roanoke Regional Airport is governed by a regional commission. Salem is generally more reluctant to participate in these efforts than Roanoke City and Roanoke County. Botetourt County also participates in some efforts such as the regional library system. Whether more functions <b>should</b> <b>be</b> provided on a consolidated basis, or if <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> consolidated, is an often discussed issue. Consolidation referendums in 1969 and 1990 failed because of the opposition of voters in Roanoke County. The issue has remained dormant since the 1990 referendum.|$|R
500|$|During {{the tumultuous}} {{year of the}} late 1650s {{proposals}} for how <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> structured and how powers should be balanced were widely debated, in private, in public debates in Parliament, and through the publication of pamphlets. [...] Vane used all of these methods to promote his ideas. [...] In 1660 he published A Needful Corrective or Balance in Popular Government. [...] This open letter was essentially a response to James Harrington's The Commonwealth of Oceana, a 1656 treatise describing Harrington's view of a utopian government, which included limitations on property ownership and a legislature with an elected upper chamber. [...] Harrington's thesis was that power arose from property ownership, and concentrated land ownership led to oligarchic and monarchic forms of government. [...] Vane disagreed with this, arguing instead that power came from godliness, and presented a somewhat apocalyptic argument {{in support of his}} idea. [...] Vane supporter Henry Stubbe stated openly in October 1659 that permanent Senators would be required. These proposals caused a terminal split in Vane's alliance with Heselrige, whose followers mostly deserted Vane.|$|E
500|$|Smith, {{a farmer}} from the Midlands town of Selukwe {{who had been}} seriously wounded while serving in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War, was Southern Rhodesia's first {{native-born}} Prime Minister. Regarded in British political circles as a [...] "raw colonial"—when he took over, Smith's personal experience of the UK comprised four brief visits—he promised a harder line than Field in independence talks. The RF's replacement of Field drew criticism from the British Labour Party, whose leader Harold Wilson called it [...] "brutal", while Nkomo described the new Smith Cabinet as [...] "a suicide squad... {{not interested in the}} welfare of all the people but only in their own". Smith said he was pursuing a middle course between black nationalist rule and apartheid so that there would still be [...] "a place for the white man" [...] in Southern Rhodesia; this would benefit the blacks too, he claimed. He held that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> based [...] "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be [...] "no African nationalist government here in my lifetime".|$|E
500|$|Lloyd George {{immediately}} {{set about}} transforming the British war effort, taking firm {{control of both}} military and domestic policy. In the first 235 days of its existence, the War Cabinet met 200 times. Its creation marked {{the transition to a}} state of total war—the idea that every man, woman and child should play his or her part in the war effort. Moreover, it was decided that members of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the men who controlled the war effort, primarily utilising the power they had been given under the Defence of the Realm Act. For the first time, the government could react quickly, without endless bureaucracy to tie it down, and with up-to-date statistics on such matters as the state of the merchant navy and farm production. The policy marked a distinct shift away from Asquith's initial policy of laissez-faire, which had been characterised by Winston Churchill's declaration of [...] "business as usual" [...] in [...] The success of Lloyd George's government can also be attributed to a general lack of desire for an election, and the practical absence of dissent that this brought about.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found <b>the</b> weak <b>government</b> under <b>the</b> Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that <b>the</b> new federal <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> supreme over <b>the</b> states. Mason agreed that <b>the</b> federal <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> more powerful than the states.|$|R

500|$|On 3 September 1654, the First Protectorate Parliament was called; of the 400 English members, {{only two}} were lawyers — Hooke, a Baron of the Exchequer, and Hale, {{who was elected}} Member of Parliament for his home county of Gloucestershire. Hale was an active MP, persuading the Commons to reject a motion to destroy the Tower of London's archives, and {{introducing}} several motions to preserve the authority of Parliament. The first was that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> [...] "in a Parliament and a single person limited and restrained as the Parliament should think fit", and he later proposed that the English Council of State be subject to re-election every three years by the House of Commons, that the militia should be controlled by Parliament, and that supplies should only be granted to the army for limited periods. While these proposals got support, Cromwell refused to allow any MPs into the Commons until they signed an oath recognising his authority, which Hale refused to do. As such, {{none of them were}} passed. Dissatisfied with the First Protectorate Parliament, Cromwell dissolved it on 22 January 1655.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Southern Rhodesian press {{predicted}} that Smith would not last long; one column called him [...] "a momentary man", {{thrust into the}} spotlight by the RF's dearth of proven leaders. His only real rival to replace Field had been William Harper, an ardent segregationist who had headed the Dominion Party's Southern Rhodesian branch during the Federal years. Some reporters predicted Welensky's imminent introduction to Southern Rhodesian politics {{at the head of}} an RF–UFP coalition government, but Welensky showed little interest in this idea, saying he would be unable to manoeuvre in an RF-dominated House. The RF's replacement of Field with Smith drew criticism from the British Labour leader Harold Wilson, who called it [...] "brutal", while JB Johnston, the British High Commissioner in Salisbury, indicated his disapproval by refusing to meet Smith for two weeks after he took office. The ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo branded the new Smith Cabinet [...] "a suicide squad... interested not in the welfare of all the people but only in their own", and {{predicted that}} the RF would [...] "eventually destroy themselves". Asserting that a lasting [...] "place for the white man" [...] in Southern Rhodesia would benefit all of the country's people, the new Prime Minister said <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> based [...] "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be [...] "no African nationalist government here in my lifetime".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the elected}} UFA members espoused radical {{political}} doctrines calculated {{to transform the}} provincial government. Brownlee quickly became identified with the caucus's conservative faction. At the caucus meeting that approved his appointment, he {{put an end to}} discussion of whether nominations for justices of the peace should come from UFA locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the Attorney-General. [...] Later, many UFA MLAs argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> treated as motions of non-confidence. [...] They were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions, such as money bills, that were conventionally considered tests of the government's confidence. [...] Brownlee warned these MLAs that regardless of their beliefs, the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta was free to request the government's resignation any time he considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislature's confidence. [...] Despite this warning, UFA MLAs John Russell Love and Alex Moore proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention. The proposal attracted notice from across Canada; R. B. Bennett advised Brownlee, his former clerk, to warn Moore and Love that it was unconstitutional and demand that they withdraw it. Brownlee was reluctant to do so, since a similar proposal {{had been part of the}} UFA's election platform, and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague [...] "statement of intent".|$|E

2500|$|Objections to {{the wide}} {{adoption}} of positions suggested by Stiglitz's discoveries do not come from economics itself, but mostly from political scientists, especially {{in the field of}} sociology.
